Will it work with Windows 8?
You should look here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=282196403 After the game was rereleased on Steam, a Windows 8 user wrote a Steam guide on how to fix it to work on Windows 8. Note that this is done for the Steam edition. It's almost the same as the disc version, but instead of being under Steam&gt;Steamapps&gt;common it would be under its own little folder in Program Files, or under a Microprose folder.
Will it work on Windows 7 ?
Yes

Will this game work on a windows 7 laptop?
yes, I have a laptop w/ w7 and it works
Will this work on Windows 8.1?
8.1? I do not know. It *just about* works on Vista - meaning that some of the tables appear stretched. It came out before wide screen monitors, so it's video driver might have issues with proper scaling/aspect ratio. Plays fine on Vista though.
how many different machines?
There are 7 tables.
Will it play on a Windows 7 64bit OS?
Yes, this is an awsome game if you like pinball.
Does this game work on windows 7, if so, do you loose any controls, graffics or sound quality because I it wasn't made originally for windows 7+
I will work, there were others that have asked this question, in almost the same fashion as you have asked. I run this on Vista 64 and it does fine. You don't loose anything, and I think I've read it also works on Win8 too. You can still use the keyboard commands for it, though its biggest issue is some of the games have sticky key issues, making it difficult to play them, and that is a quirk of the game that was never corrected as far as I know.
What machines are included? I know seven tables are included.
A boxing-themed pinball machine, Spirit of (19)'76' Haunted House, etc. Gottleib manufacturers.
Does it work with windows 7?
Yes but I wouldn't buy it if I were you. Check out The Pinball Arcade now available on all platforms, It's amazing!! There are about 50 different classic tables and they play great. Check out www.pinballarcade.com. You'll love it.
will it work on my PC that is running window 7?
If you looked at previous questions and the answers that were given, it appears to work on Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1. I have it on CD, and know it works on Vista just fine on my older non widescreen monitor, however it's still notorious for the dreaded stuck key situation on some games, meaning the key commands for the flippers sometimes stick.
Will it work on Windows XP?
Yes.
does this game works on windows 7 vista hp laptop and windows 7 hp laptop computers let me know right away please and thank you
I really don't know, I do know it works on Vista, though I currently not gotten it reinstalled when I had to reinstall Vista over a year ago. I would imagine it might install on Win7 and work fine, unless there is a significant difference internally between Vista and Win7. I should note that I often played it on a standard aspect ratio monitor instead of my widescreen monitor (in dual screen mode) and it did fine. After all, it IS a Microsoft product so getting it to work on later OS may be easier than some others if you have issues initially as there is a make compatible mode for such older programs in newer OS'.

No, I didn't know it until I got it. I have to symulate one of te OS which the game is compatible with.
Does this game work on Windows 8?
Don't know, I use it on Windows 7. There is a problem with it saving games, other than that is just like when it came out.
Does this battle chest version come with a map editor?
Yes it does. Thanks for your interest.
is it strictly online game?
No starcraft has a decent single player campaign as well as the ability to play scenarios and general free for all against bots or people or a mix. If you get the game do a search for custom maps and scenarios. The map editor is extremely versatile and people have made dozens of custom scenarios and setting. I've even found mini rpgs
Has everyone playing on Windows 7 had problems with saving games?
I have never had a problem saving

Description says the N64 comes in the original box, but no pictures of this are shown. Please provide an image of the box, so we may see its quality.
make sure you read each sellers description, not the header. each seller sells there item a little different. how ever if the seller states its in the original box they should provide you with pictures. if they cant don't buy it
Does the system come with the jumper pack and any games?
You have to read the sellers description, if they mention that they're included, you're good to go. Also ask for exact pictures of the actual item.
I have a Wii U and Nintendo is starting to put up N64 games up on Virtual Console. Should I still get the N64?
I say yes just because its always fun to have the old system...and sometimes the new system and games cant compare to the feel and control of old systems&#128516;
does it have av and power cord
Mine did, but it will depend on the seller you buy it from. Usually they'll have a description somewhere on the page that says what it comes with.
dos it come with a game?
no, system only, no game, no cords, no controllers
How many controllers?
I received one controller as written in the description from whom I bought it from.
does this nintendo modle work with the expansion pack genaric that u can get on amazon
Yes
What would you recommend cleaning the outer surface of the console?
Alcohol pads work well. They also work well for cleaning the electrical connections.
Does Ocarina of Time require the expansion pak?
Wow it's been years since i played ocarina but last time i remember, i dont think so but like i said its been years so you can probably ask another
Is an expansion pak really necessary?
I don't think it is

No!
compatable: does this wheel work on windows 7?
i need to know the same question myself just orederd one on amazon , please help ? any tips or info.
One of the reviewers mentioned having prostitutes at the end of the game. I am looking to buy this for my grandchildren. Are there prostitutes?
I've been playing this game for over fifteen years and I have never come across a single prostitute. It could be a typo, you can prospect for gold if you take the 'Sacramento Trail'. Maybe he meant 'prospectors'. I think it's a good idea that you are buying this game for your grandchildren. Just be sure that they have a computer that can run it. I played it on "Windows 95" in my youth but it works with my "Windows XP" laptop. Any newer Windows OS probably won't run it. You could try stuff like 'Doss Box' but that is a route that you probably don't want to take because of all the complex computer work. You could take the computer to a microsoft store but that could end up costing hundreds of dollars and even then, it's not guaranteed to work. But if you do have the proper computer hardware, "Oregon Trail 2" is the best version of the "Oregon Trail" series.
Will this version work with a Windows XP, 3.3 GHz, 1.98 GB of Ram?
It should. If you have a 32 bit version of windows Xp should work out of the box. If you have the 64 bit version you will need to manually install it but it will work fine too.
How many discs does this software have? Do new discs need to be inserted to go on in the game?
There is just one disc, so no need to change anything during the game. It worked fine with my Windows 7 laptop. I just got a new Windows 8 laptop -- haven't tried it on that yet.
This game will not install because I have a 64 bit processor and this game is for a 32 bit processor only. How can I install this game on my computer?
You can't. This program is for much older computer and won't install on newer models. I had the same issue.
will this work on newer computer like 8.1?
No it won't, not out of the box. There is a work around that you can look up online though, after that it runs fine. I've done the modification myself and it works with my windows 8.1 64bit laptop.
does it read to the player or does the player have to do reading on each page to understand what to do next? My child is not proficient enough to read
I think if you click a button it will read to you but I'm not 100% sure
I cannot get the game to work on my lap top operates windows 7 64 bit pc
I never got it to work on Windows 7 ...it will only work on XP
Will this work for a MacBook?
No it's for windows. An older version like 95. I can't even play it.
I have Windows 8, will this work on my computer?
Normally no, but there is a work around that I found just by Googling for solutions. I can now play it on Windows 8, but I have to go into the file folder and click on a particular icon. It will then play in a smaller window. It does not fill up the entire screen. Otherwise it works.
I have Windows 8 on my computer. will this work?
Windows 8 I'm not sure I have 7 & it wouldn't work i luckily have a laptop that has XP on it so that's how I found out it worked on XP
Does it come in the original box?
No. And the console didn't work. I used the cords that came to hook up to a previous console I already had.
What all does your system come with, The wire hook up for the tv, controllers? anything?
Yes
How do you set it up with the new flat screen TV's. Any differance?
You should be able to plug it in the same and then go to channel 3
I would like to setup a package deal please. I would like all needed cables for play, two controllers, and donkey kong country. Can you do this?
You have to do some shopping, go to Gamestop and I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for.
whats the cost for the whole system meaning the picture with the games control ect
It costs $50.00 and up, depending on the condition.
whats the cost for the whole system meaning the picture with the games control ect
$50.00 and up.
Anyone elses show up without cables r a controller, despite what the ad says??? Messed up.
You need to ask the seller which items are included, ask for pictures.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THIS NITENDO COME WITH 2 Controllers ??
Hi Mr Reis. It does not come with 2 controllers unless it specifies. Your in luck though. I can sell you a setup like that for a very affordable price. Would you like me to help you out with that, sir? Thanks!
Hello. What come with this??????????????
It all depends on who you're buying it from. Read the seller's description to find out what items are included.
Does this include the original box?
Only if the seller you select advertises it as 'includes original box'. Most are fairly specific saying 'console only 'or 'console and power, no video cable', etc. If you want the box, check the 'collectible' section of resellers.
can I use this with my xbox 360?
No.this is for the pc only
can you buy games for children to play with this
I do not know. My 8 year old nephew would use the wheel to play my husband's Formula 1 racing game. But we didn't have any children's games to try it with.
will it work with papyrus nascar4?
yes
Does this work on Mac computers?
No
I have a formula force set I bought this for my autistic grandson Im not very familar with tech it doesn't have the software how do I get it
Go to Logitech website to download
Will This work on Windows 8.1?
Yes it will. To use it on anything you will need to get the Logitech Profiler. But as long as you install the profiler it will automatically download drivers when you plug it in.
does this have a d pad and the X,Y,A,B buttons? I don't see any in the pic. Thanks!
No, but it does have programmable buttons.
Does this wheel only turn 90 degrees left and right?
Yes
does this steering wheel work with farming simulator2013
It works fine with Euro Truck Simulator 2, made by the same company around the same time, so I would assume it does. Yes.
How many missions and planes are there?
The simulator includes a good variety of WWII fighter planes including the P-51D Mustang, P-47D Thunderbolt, P-38J Lightning, Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX, Bf1096G-6, Fw190A-8, and Me262A1. Missions: There are 35 single missions, a full campaign (which may be played as the Axis or Allies), and the mission editor to create your own mission.
Does it work on 64-bit Windows 7 and is a joystick compadible with it?
after meny tries i could not get any of my old or new fighter programs to work on 7 -64 bit.
Does it work on Windows XP?
Mine worked on my xp system but couldn't get it to load right on 7 - 64 bit

Can I use these with Window 8/8.1?
Yes, you will need to go to their website to download version 4.55 or above of the CH Control Manager program, then you'll be all set. Find it here: http://www.chproducts.com/13-29170-Downloads-and-Community.php
Could this be adapted to be used in racing games also?
I googled the question and found many forums of users using both the CH yoke and pedals for racing games. So yes they can be use for racing. - Dave
How far are the pedals apart? i.e. the spacing distance.
4 inches. They are also at an awkward angle which is quite tasking during extended sessions.
Is there any adjustment in sensitivity of the toe and heel positions. I have a model PPU995 which has no null position.
I don't think so. My son and husband use this for flight simulator and they seem pleased with it.
does anyone use them for Star Citizen, and if so how would you rate their preference?
Yep. They're a bit small and certainly take some getting used to but they're accurate and work very well once you get them setup properly within the game. I use them for roll and use the xml route to set bindings which is a bit more complex than the in-game interface but it's more fully featured. 1 to 10, I'd give them a 6 or 7. There is much much better, but not for around a hundred bucks. Saitek's pedals are good too but they don't integrate with CH software which is one huge bonus for the whole CH line of gear. Good luck and see you in the verse.
Do Pro Pedals work with Windows 8.1? Just got this yesterday. Devices/Printers recognized it. CtrlMgr didn't. Then Devices/Printers didn't.
Mine do in Windows 8.1 x64. Also, plug and play, no CD needed.
I don't need 7 feet of USB cable. If I replaced the cable with a different, shorter one, would the pedals still work?
No. The cable is hard-wired into the pedal base. The wires are very delicate, and would be difficult to reattach. It'd void the warranty. They are great pedals. I'd just coil up the excess cable and secure it with tape or a zip tie.
Does anyone use these for Elite Dangerous? If so, how are they?
i actually do use these for Elite Dangerous and i have them set as yaw.. they work perfectly and needed no additional help or deadzone. they are spot on right out of the box.
I bought the it but I don't know how to use it?
I suppose that if you buy it, you know what's it's for, that is to use with a plane simulator (the Joystick is used for pitch and roll control, and pedals for rudder/yaw control); Depending of what sort of sim. software you use, settings for this devise is generaly in the same control panel than the joystick one. On Windows you'll perhaps need to installe the drivers for it (for Mac nothing to do, as usual, it runs)
Will these work with the Saitek Yoke, Throttle Quadrant and Trim Control?
Yes, no problem
Not stable. how do you mount it? How do you mount this device?
You might try using a piece of 1" X 2" strip of wood about 11" long as a shim between claps and the bottom of the table and/or desk. It worked great for me.
Is this only for flight sims, or can this be used for all driving games as well?
I would not reccomend this for driver Sims limited turning radius.about 45 degrees each way.
can u use it with xplane 9? Please anwser before 15.12.13, that be great because i need it for my sun's christmas present
My 14 year old son has this exact model of Yoke and he has had it for 4 years. He believes that it is compatible with xplane and looked it up and could find nothing that said it was NOT compatible. Additionally my experience with AMAZON is that if you buy something believing it will work with something else and it does not, they will take it back and refund the full price as long as it is returned to them quickly, is not damaged and has all of the items that came with the product like manuals etc. Good Luck
What are the default assignments to the buttons and levers in Flight Simulator X?
I can't remember but then again, who cares! You can and should customize them yourself and it is very easily done! One thing for sure, calibrate your yoke as otherwise it will not work properly! It's also very easily to do, takes 1 min at most!
does it work with mac 10.8.5
Yes....plug and play.
My son has the Microsoft flight simulator X plane 10 and wants a yoke. Is this compatible?
Yes
does it works with car simulation game?
Not sure as it was designed for flight simulator. I would not buy it for car sim though.
Does the control rod extend out of the back of the case, or is it completely enclosed? Thanks...
It extends out the back. It's not much though.
Does it use external power or just the usb? If it does use external power does it work on 240V?
It uses USB power only
Will this work with Microsoft X on Windows 8 ?
I have on way to test im on win7 for my games and sims
how good is it
The gameboy is pretty good and mine still works just fine after all this time.
Does this include with charger?
It runs on AA batteries. The SP model has a rechargeable battery and should come with a charger, but this one uses regular batteries.
Hi, is their is a batteries charge include or only use a batteries.
You cannot charge the Game Boy Advance. You just put in new batteries. There is the Game Boy Advance SP which is rechargeable (and has a light).
Are there games that are preloaded on this unit, or do you have to buy them seperately?
Only separately
On a scale from 1 to 10, how bright is the screen?
The screen is not overly bright. It is good for playing games. I do not remember if there was a brightness control. I hope this description is good enough without resorting to a scale.
Does this include a charger?
no this does not come with a charger.
Is the backlit screen annoying?
My GBA doesn't have a backlit screen. All the colors of the GBA don't have a backlit screen.
Do they still make a ac adapter for the GBA?
I doubt it. They have even started to stop making stuff for the original Nintendo DS. For old consoles like this, it much more likely that you will find it easier online than from the company.
I have seen a device called the GBA Worm Light (Screen Light for Gameboy Advance) does that mean you need light on the screen to see the game?
No, the device is to allow you to play in the dark. The older game boy consoles are not "back-lit" this means that if there is no light around you won't be able to see the game. Like the screen on a TI-83 or most other older calculators.
Does it use batteries ?
Yes. To increase battery life, turn off color and volium
what is the difference between the gba and the gba sp ?
The GBA SP is designed more like the old Game Boy Color, but it folds in the middle, making it more compact.
I am replacing a generic white wireless Gamecube controller. Will it's receiver work with a Wavebird?
No, the official Nintendo wave bird receiver is necessary. Other 3rd party receivers won't operate on the same fequencies
Does it come with the receiver?
Make sure to go through the list of sellers. Not every seller includes the receiver. The one I bought did not include one, though I already had one from my now busted Wavebird.
does it work with the wii?
It works with a Wii just fine. It won't work with a Wii-U because there aren't any controller ports, but it works with a Wii.
Does it come with the receiver ?
Mine came with a receiver, I just wish the controller worked a bit more.
will these controllers work wirelessly with wii to play mario kart purchased through wii shop?
it works on the wii so i am assuming yes it will work for mario kart
does the save work?
Yes the save works. They actually replaced the save battery with a brand new one so the save will work for many more years.
I have a GBA and tried playing on that but after a few minutes the game will crash and all my progress will be deleted
Either your GBA is malfunctioning, or the game is. Try another game to test your GBA. Also, try cleaning the pins on the game with a Qtip and rubbing alcohol. - DAMP NOT WET. MAKE SURE TO LET THE GAME DRY COMPLETELY BEFORE USING IT. The game will not save your progress if it needs a new battery. If it keeps crashing, then it is definitely defective.
The game comes with the all box stuff?
No it does not come with the box or anything. Mine came in a game boy color cartridge case with a new battery. If you want one still in a box, it will cost a lot of money because most kids opened the box and then threw it away.
Can you play this on the Gameboy Advance sp?
yes you can, I play it on mine all the time.
Work fine in Win7 64bits ? to Il2 saga ... Thanks
Been using it with Windows 7 64 bit for years, works perfectly under that OS with native support.
Will this work on Win8 64bits? I will play mostly the "Battlefield" games.
Not sure. I play BF4 on Win7 Pro without any issues, however.
Does it come with a power chord?
Mine did yes
Will this work on windows XP?
Yes. When I had that joystick, I was using a machine running XP
Does it work with mac?
It does work with Windows 8 with default Drivers, I don't think Microsoft had made new drivers available for MAC. You might have to use built in default Drivers to make it work. Also without Microsoft Driver suppose you will not have FORCEFEEDBACK feature turned on.
Can you lock the ruder axis so the stick no longer twists?
No you cannot. Not on the stick itself. But most who buy the twist handle "rudder" type sticks need/love that feature. You could buy a generic stick without twist handle to fit your specific needs.
does this stick come with usb connection?
Yes
Is this joystick the "later" version with the red trigger button? Some pictures of the actual item would be helpful in making my purchase decision. Please post some pictures, Thanks, Dennis Boyd.
Hi Dennis The one I purchased has a silver grey trigger button. And it is flawless, works great.
Does it work well on windows 8.1?
Yes I am still using mine without any issues
Can you use this with a laptop?
As long as it has a USB port it should work fine. Windows xp and windows 7 work fine, I'm sure windows 8 should work as well.
Just bought a used Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick to work with my old Combat Flight Simulator but, though it loaded, it doesn't work. Any thoughts?
Windows 7 does NOT like the device driver for that game. CFS 2 and 3 work under Win 7 and the joystick works FINE for them and all other games I have - including the Battlefield series including 3 and 4, but the first CFS game does NOT work with that joystick. I have searched for a solution but they are complicated and do not seem to work.
Is this a USB stick?
yes mine is. but be careful some are not. the old models are not usb
Need a good joystick to play old game. Microsoft combat flight simulator. Any suggestions?
The microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2 joystick works great, and has all the functionality it needs. What I really love about that joystick is it lasts forever. I've been through many joysticks and I've had really bad luck with newer, digital joysticks. If you take apart the sidewinder you will see it's an analog joystick and personally it seems to last much longer even treating it harshly.
Work in win7 64bits?
Yes and no. After I wrote my initial review on the Sidewinder, it worked great for about a week. Afterwards, it was hit or miss as to when it would work. I finally gave up and got this instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CXYMFS/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 No problems since!
Does anyone happen to have the software that they could upload somewhere? I bought this without the CD and I want to use it on my Windows 98 machine.
i am not sure i do beleave it did NOT come with software but i will look for some
I down loaded f18 carrier landing to my "I MAC" computer can I use a joy stick also I have OS mountain loin program the down version is 5.5 from Rortos
It may not work with an Apple product...the joystick is a Microsoft product...they (Microsoft & Apple) don't play together!
Does your system come with all the cords and controller?
YES! It MUST come with controller and all cables. According to the UPC, that is what the system came with so according to Amazon's policy, it MUST come with all those cables and controller. All the people selling them without them are violating Amazon's policy.
I'm sorry, I've looked at all the questions and answers but I thought I should ask again: Does it come with all the necessary wires and one controller
Yes, it comes with all necessary wires and a controller.
The gamecube I bought has a broken disc reader and was very filthy when I took it out of the box. I.E. cobwebs and caked on dust.
This isn't a question
Does the system come with the game where the bunny chases carrots?
No it does not
does it comes in with the original box
It will say in the description of the item what it all includes.
Will this be able to hook up to an HDTV? Specifially a Samsung Smart TV?
The Gamecube only supports AV cables. So if your TV has AV ports, which it most likely does, then it should work but there is not a way to play games in HD.
Does this one come with the cords and controler?
Yes
Does it come with any games?
Yes
Does it come with a memory card?
No it doesn't . The only thing it comes with its Is the console itself everything else is sold separately.
does it come with acontroller
Yep sorry I thought I mentioned that in the review. Cheers
are any of the roller coaster tycoons playable on windows 8?
I play my roller coaster tycoon 2 on windows 8. Runs perfectly fine and isn't buggy. Just like when I was running it on windows 7!!
Is this game playable on Windows 7?
Yes it is
Will the first RollerCoster Tycoon work on Mac?
Yes
how do i play this game if my macbook has no disc drive?
Well, I don't have a Mac book I have a Sony Vaio Laptop, sorry. I think you need to buy something like a small box that connects to your laptop so you can put in CDs. All in all, fun game.
What version would work best on win 7?
Windows 98/2000/Me/XP will all work with a windows 7 computer
What about Windows 8?
No. When I looked into upgrading to windows 8 that was one of the programs it listed as being non-compatible
Will this work with windows 7?
It should, I use it on an old laptop that hasn't been updated in years, and it works great.
Will this game work on a Mac?
Yes

does this stick work on simple programs like x-plane no combat
I have X-Plane 10, but find that the CH Flightstick Pro (USB) is somewhat unstable on this program. By working with it more I hope to improve it, maybe. I have an HP Pavilion i5 with 8 megs of RAM but maybe not the graphics that I need with some of the newer sims. I have an old PII with man sims running on it with a total CH set up, Flightstick Pro, Throttle Pro and CH Rudders with par. ports. With some real aircraft experience, I'll have to say that the old sims were the most realistic, even though they lacked in graphics. Also, you may have a later version than XPlane 10. I have read that '10' did have some control problems. Otherwise, the Flightstick Pro seems to work well with MS Flightsim X and some others I have. CH is a very good company. I've even toured their plant some years ago.
Does it have force feedback?
No force feedback. No Z axis for rudder control either.
How durable are the springs? I owned a couple Flightstick Pros a long time ago and the springs broke after a few months.
Used mine for years.. Still going and working fine!,, even has lived through the Grand Kids !!!!
Does flightstick Pro USB 4 have it's own throttle control on the stick
Yes, no rudder controls though.
Does the Control Manager software work in Windows 8.1?
According to the info on "Ch Hanger.com," the Control Manager is supported in Windows 8.1. You might want to check this out also. Hope this helps. Ron K
Is this joystick compatible with Windows 8/8.1?
According to 'mypilotstore.com' the CH Flightstick Pro is compatible with Windows 8, but was not inclusive to 8.1. It probably is. Thanks, Ron K
Can this work on the ipad?
Not for usb. Bluetooth support for external controllers are only available on a jailbroken device. Haven`t seen anything for USB.
Is there a way to adjust sensitivity of the aileron and elevator trim wheels? They are incredibly over-sensitive on mine (with Gold X)
I have not encountered this problem before, but, if you enter the joystick calibration program from inside the Gold X program, you should be able to determine if the stick is operating properly by watching the response on the calibration screen. I do recall that years ago I had some issues with Microsoft CFS2 with loss of control of aircraft in the program, but, that was due to program errors and settings. If Gold X has difficulty settings, you might check those and see if they are set properly. Good luck.
Does flightstick Pro USB 4 have adjustable spring and is it x-y centered
No adjustable springs. it is x-y centered and comes with good software. I use it because it is one of the few sticks made that left handed players can use.
I am handicap can I use this to play Call of Duty games in my computer I cant use a xbox controler and hard to use keyboard, thank you for any help..r
Hi. I believe that the combatstick could be used as it only requires a usb port and the companies software however I would e-mail CH products and inquire just to be on the save side. Also, this product has no twist grip feature so that would also be a consideration.
Can the left wheel trim be used as a throttle?
Yes. I used it like that until I bought a separate throttle. You'll want to be sure and make sure the throttle wheel is calibrated each time you fire up the machine because mine jumps around a bit, or build dead zone in the axis extremes to reduce throttle sensitivities in those areas.
does this have twist rudder
No
Does the Combatstick use HALL sensors?
No, all CH products use classic pots. However, they are "high quality," at least that's what people say. I've never heard of anyone's pots wearing out on CH gear, unlike other manufacturers.
Will it work with Win 8 ???
Ch should work with all library drivers-if not call CH in calif and get them
Does work with A-10C Warthog - PC: http://www.amazon.com/A-10C-Warthog-P...
I would guess that it does, but I don't know personally. It works with IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946, which is why I bought it originally. Great stick.
whats the differ in fighter and combat stick?
There's some conflicts in these answers, so let me straighten things up. The Fighter replaces two push buttons with one 4-way hat and one 2-way hat. Other than that the Combat and Fighter stick are identical. They both have a throttle wheel left of the stick, and built in trim wheels for the x and y axes. Trim is a bit troubling on most sticks since you don't get the feedback on the controls as less stick pressure is required. Don't think that this makes this stick bad since any sim that has trim has this drawback unless you have a force-feedback stick that simulates this (those are almost impossible to find.) The extra hats are great for modern jet study sims, but if you are into games like IL-2, there are normally enough buttons. On the otherhand you can map a ton of functions to all the extra contols, and adding a throttle that has a lot of buttons means you may not even touch your keyboard ingame. The Fighterstick tends to be at least 20 bucks more, so if you want the extra functionality, that's the price.
Are the drivers and CH software compatible with Windows 8.1?
Hi I just checked my mail : CH Products In my experience thus far has out of the Box worked w/every OS I have had most recent PC-Win Ultimate 7. This said, It should work fine. We all know that there are exceptions to every rule. This is "Y" They created Technical Support. 'Nuff said here. Best Flying. Scott ~
Is this stick compatible with the saitek throttle quadrant?
I am not sure that it can work with the CH Combatstick. CH has their own software for programming the devices. My advice is to go here and ask your questions. http://www.ch-hangar.com/forum/index.php Good luck to you.
CH Fighter Stick vs Saitek X52
I found the review comparing the two at FiringSquad's site quite helpful. http://www.firingsquad.com/hardware/ch_products_saitek_x52_review In the end the reviewer discovered that it largely depends on the games you play and your personal style.
left or right handed? Is this a joystick for lefties?
The default model is right hand only, but I have seen a left hand version. I am not sure where it came from.
Would this be a good fit for a helicopter sim like DCS Black Shark or Huey?
Yes
where can I download an operating manual
Here are some instructions on downloading and troubleshooting: ftp://ftp.chproducts.com/pub/pdf/Fighterstick%20USB.pdf The Control Manager download that lets you customize and set up your Flightstick is here: http://www.chproducts.com/Flightstick-Pro-v13-d-723.html Don't think there was a written manual?
Does it have independent centering for the pitch and roll axes? Can you feel that the roll axis is centered while moving the pitch axis?
Yes, you can feel it centering. You can feel the springs stop fighting you.
my X52 is being sent back, too many driver issues where in the middle of playing DCS World, the sticks lights up flashing and fails to work.
Do not have any problems, but I don't use that often.
Does anyone here have one the lasted more than 10 years? How is it holding up?
My experience is that the connection technology doesn't last 10 years. I replaced mine when I couldn't find a good adaptor to switch from the old pins to USB. The old one probably still works fine if my newer computer had a port for it.
Does this have a twist access or not? On CH website, it says it has a three way axis, which makes me think it does, but some reviews say it doesn't.
No twist axis. It's a great joystick, rugged and reliable but a twist axis would be nice. Software is easy to use.
Is there a lock somewhere? My buttons don't depress like they should and seem to be frozen.
I am not there but I will throw in a few things on this. This stick has very very short throw buttons on it. Even the main trigger move very little when pressed. They all have very little throw to them but It makes it easy to trigger actions. They are mechinical switches so there wouldn't be a way to freeze/lock all of them that I can think of. Hope this helps.
Can the ch fighterstick USB be made to work with windows 8?
Yes it can. I really can't recommend the CH Products enough. I own the Fighterstick, Pro Throttle, and Pro Pedals. I know several people using this setup on Windows 8. Just head over to the CH Hanger for any assistance.
Does this work on Windows 8 ?
I just got a new laptop with windows 8.1 and it works fine thus far. It should work okay.
Has anyone tried this game on Win 7 op system ?
my old PC and my now newly-built one both have Windows-7 installed, and "Doom 3" runs perfectly fine. Oh, and I'd stick with the 2004-05 versions of this and "Resurrection of Evil", and not get the BFG Edition (as they nerfed the hell out of that one)
It won't install! (Macbook Pro) After dragging the .dmg to the HDD and double clicking it, the icon just bounces and then hangs. Help!
Try to run it on medium install. It could be that your MAC can't support the game on full install
what is difference doom 3 for 39.99 / doom 3 bfg edition for 15.99 ??????
Collectors value. The thing is the BFG edition is the better of the two. With the BFG Edition You not only get Doom 3, but you get the original Doom, Doom 2, Doom 3, Doom 3 Resurrection of evil add on pack, plus 8 new levels known as, "The lost mission" that was never before seen from the rest of the Doom world. While with Doom 3, you just get, well... Doom 3. However I suppose the price for Doom 3 would be greater as it does have a bit of collectors value at this point, especially with the new Doom game about to drop between 2015 and 2016. But I digress, if you're gonna try to get into Doom, I suggest the BFG edition all the way around. I have both copies and BFG is a well worth it buy.
Will this work on Windows 8
it works on windows 7 so I think it should work on windows 8
Are there only 3 discs in this game?
I don't remember. I gave the game away after playing it. The game kind of sucked. Sorry
Does it clamp to the edge of a desk?
Yes it does. It has a main screw-down from underneath, and 2 side clamps that are operated from on top.
Logitech MOMO force feedback racing wheel: Logitech MOMO Force Feedback Racing Wheel Is this Wheel compatible with Windows 7 on a 64 bit system?
I use one of these on a pc with Windows 7,64 bit. It is compatible. EA Need for speed shift2 unleashed works well if your video card is up to it !
Where do I get a charger? I have this wheel and I want to play Project Cars with it. But the original charger was lost on my last relocation.
It will be a power adapter, not a charger. You just need to find a power adapter that matches the voltage on the wheel and the same pin size. Second hand stores are always a good option for finding those.
Is the shifter manual or automatic? Thx
Push forward for up, back for down (and it has paddles behind the wheel too) SO 'Semi Automatic' ...ie there is no clutch....and its just back and forward...it doesnt have 'gates' like a manual stick in a real car...
where do Ifind a manual?
You will more than likely find one online. I didn't receive a manual when I purchased mine. It was refurbished, though, so that might explain why.
works with ps4
unfortunately, no :(
i have a momo wheel that is about 10 years old . is it the some as the ne one, and will work on windows 7
It worked fine for me for a couple of years but I had an old one like yours and eventually had to upgrade to a G27 because the MOMO started to steer to the left instead of centering automatically. As long as your drivers are up to date and your steering is true your MOMO will work with Windows 7... and with Windows 7 you will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free when it becomes available.
will this wheel work with windows 8.1
The red version does for me...same drivers, so I dont see why not.
this wheel has pedals?
Yes
does it work for windows 8
Yes
Is this a bagpipe?
Not a bagpipe, though mostly hot air.
Can you land a jet in Top Gun with this?
No I don't know don't get this you have to have like 1984 software make a better choice than I did

Does it work with all windows versions? (Windows 7)?
Yes you should download glovepie 0.45 and take a look at it.
does this unit come with the charging cord? Im not seeing any infor about included with system or pics of any accessories.
No, I had to purchase one separately, but you can find one for only 4$
Bought one from a seller and it played games fine for them. The GBA SP won't play games when I try to. Broken console?
Probably, talk to the sellers. Or maybe it's your games?
Does it come with any type of warranty""..
Amazon requires all sellers to offer at least a 30 day return policy on the items they sell. Certain sellers offer a better warranty on items, as do we. Specifically check out each seller, the better their feedback the more likely they sel quality products with quality service!
is the screen bigger than original gameboy advance
Yes a little bit. But also is in color and lights up so it can be used in the dark.
Is it the backlit gameboy advanced sp?
yes, the one i had was the newer version with the brighter screen display
Does this listing come with the power cord, and the leather pouch as showin in the pictures?
Everything was included an in excellent condition
does it come with all that is in the pictures
it depends.
does the save work?
Yes
Is this a SP 101 model
yes.
Is the GBA SP Platinum the AGS 101 model?
No
Will it work with out x box live?
Yes. No Problem
Will this work on the Xbox 360?
Yes
Do these copies contain version 1.0 or the updated ones that deleted all of the glitches.
The game does not update if you don't have an Internet connection, if you have Internet connection, the game updates itself.
Can I play xbox live with this game? I mean online multiplayer. (interconnection)
no. The servers no longer support halo 2.
is this the aniversary edition?
No
will this work with xbox 1
It is made for the original Xbox, and Xbox One is not backwards compatible. Not sure which system your "1" is referring to.
when will they release a xbox 360 version game?
No, but they will on the new Xbox, the Xbox One. Halo: The Master Chief Collection has Halo 1 Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4 for $60. It also includes early access to Halo 5's multiplayer.
does this game work on Xbox 360
Hi: Yes it did most people told us that it wouldn't but my son had no issues playing it.
Does this play on xbox 360?
Yes, as long as you have an xbox 360 with an official Microsoft Hard Disk Drive. If you buy a generic HDD for a 4GB Xbox 360 console, it does not include what's required to emulate original Xbox games. There are methods described online for adding the ability to emulate original Xbox game to generic HDD. I followed one of these tutorials since the generic HDD are about half the price of Microsoft's HDD.
Will is play on a Xbox 360 Slim
Yes
Will it run properly on windows 8.1?
Initially, I did install the program on a laptop that was running Windows 8. It seemed to work fine on it. I haven't tried it on windows 8.1, but as 8.1 is a vast improvement over Windows 8, I would think it would run on it, but I can't say for sure. The only things that really seemed to change from Windows 8 and 8.1 is just that 8.1 looks like the traditional Windows desktop, and they made the side bar less sensitive. They also seemed to fix a lockup on start issue that was created with the first 8.1 Update.
I read that others supply 4CDs with this software. it so with this offer?
Yes, Raymond, This version of Microsoft Flight Simulator does have 4 CD's CD's 1, 2, and 3 load the program into your computer. CD 4 must remain in your CD Drive to activate and run the program. Happy Flights!! DWL
if I buy the 4 disc used do I need a code to get it to play ??? thank you
No, but you do need disk 4 in the cd/dvd drive.
can I run on windows 7
Absolutely.
Does the instrument panel have Garmin G1000?
Garmin 500. Easy to work with.
will it run properly on window 7
Yes
Does it require 'STEAM' for updates etc?
No you sould be able to just look on line for updates and add on
can I load the program onto an xtern and successfully game on a computer? given that the game is expandable and I want to make it as realistic as poss
I believe the question was "can you download the FSX program onto a external disk drive and the answer is yes, however the program will run fine on the C: drive of your computer since that will probably be the only drive being used at the time. If you want to add scenery or aircraft too the Flight Simulator Program, that will go directly into the FSX program.
can it run on vista?
Probably, it runs on XP. It needs speed for all the graphics. Processor and video card. Runs fine on my hopped up old XP machine. The new edition basically needs a high end gaming machine. Cool but not needed. MS generally runs somewhat old programs well, sometimes better. I am not an IT person.
What type accessories (yoke vs joystick, etc.) do people recommend? Any recommendations on particular (older, cheaper) models of them?
I use a LOGITECH EXTREME PRO. It is a joystick that is around $30. Google it to see what it looks like. There are much better and more expensive yokes and joysticks out there, but if you are just starting out, this is a good one to use.

can I play this on windows 8
Yes ... I've been playing it in Windows 8 & 8.1 from a long time now ...
Does this need a CD key? Will I be ok if I buy a used copy?
It does have a CD key, but the code can be reused. I have used mine to download it onto many different computers.
Is this an RTS or similar to the current WoW?
It's a RTS. Not similar to WoW. The online gameplay on WC3 is dead . So it's only worth buying it for the campaign. I've played WoW for 8 years and plenty of time on WC3
Does the previous versions have to be bough and installed? or Can I buy this game right away, install on my PC and play?
No the game can be played right away through a link from Battlenet with the activation codes on the disks. I like the direct kind of access and would suggest if you are a true gamer you want to download the content on the disks to start the game directly from your pc without having to indirectly access it through the online link.
Will this work on Mac OSX 10.9.5?
No
Do I have to pay monthly or yearly to play WOW and how much is it?
World of war craft the last I check it was 15
Can I play cross-platform multiplayer games with this? I have a Mac and my friends have PC's.
I am not certain, but my guess would be that you can play it online multiplayer. As for cross-platform as in computer-to-computer, I don't know.

yes, warthunder even has a preset for this the stick.

Yes indeed... it is the default joystick in Star Citizen's Arena Commander and works well. This is the main reason I purchased this stick.

In my opinion, the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick is best. Three reasons: It is very responsive based on your requirements. It is very easy to use and all the controls are where you would expect them to be. And, since I use the flight simulation as a part of my relaxing routine, it is nice to have a piece of equipment that I trust and enjoy.
Approximately what is the twist (yaw) range, in real-world degrees? And the pitch/roll range?
The joystick's handle itself twists approximately 15 degrees to either side for yaw, angles appx. 40 degrees (side to side) for roll, -pitches (forward/down) at appx 45 degrees and +pitches (backwards/up) at 30-35 degrees. What those motions will correspond to will really depend on the application in which they are used. Most flight games have advanced control settings that will let you tailor the response of the aircraft to the range of motion of the stick in advanced or personalized control set up menus.
how long is usb cable?
Approximately 4 feet.
Does this Joystick work with flight simulator x?
What other games is it compatible with? Is there a list somewhere? Are there any games included with the set-up software? Hank
Seems like this is the best "bang for your buck" is it a descent joystick for Elite Dangerous?
Yes it is an outstanding stick for Elite Dangerous, that's the reason I bought it, and couldn't be happier.
Does this work great with Elite: Dangerous?
It does. There are better HoTaS options with more buttons on both hands, but this is a great stick for the price.
Will this work to fly helicopters in BF4?
Yes it will work on Battlefield 4
Does it have a throttle lever?
Yes, it works, but it's really small and inputs are approximate.
Does this game require the use of the CD drive beyond installation?
Not anymore. Update 1.08 removed the CD check, and Update 1.10 was just released to allow Multiplayer after GameSpy shuts down :)
work for Windows 7 Home ?
This and halo custom edition both work for win 7
does this game work with windows 8?
Have used on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1
I've never been a gamer. If I buy this game for my PC -- figured I'd start with the earliest Halo -- what other equipment would I need to play?
Well a computer that can handle it, which isn't hard since it's an old game. If you want, then an Xbox controller but that's optional. Really just the keyboard and mouse. I hope I answered correctly.
Hi, can someone please type out the PC requirements for this game? I love Halo multiplayer, so I'm going to buy a PC just for this.
That's like asking if I can play DVD on Blu-Ray: Minimum system requirements Operating System: Microsoft Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Second Edition, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me), Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft Windows XP. Computer/Processor: 733 megahertz (MHz) processor. DirectX: DirectX 9.0 or later. (DirectX 9.0b is installed by Halo.) Memory: 128 megabytes (MB) of RAM. Hard Disk: 1.2 gigabytes (GB) of free hard disk space. Video card: 32 MB with 3D Transform and Lighting capable. CD: 8X. Sound: Sound card, speakers, or headphones with multiplayer play. *56.6 Kilobytes per second (KBps) modem or 10 MB network adapter. Multiplayer servers require broadband to run a server. *Additionally, you must have an Internet Service provider (ISP) or a Local Area Network (LAN), if you want to play multi-player games. From: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829479
Can you play using a game controller, or is it keyboard/mouse only?
you can use a game controller.That how I play the game.You will also like the game.
Does this game work on a Powerbook G4 (Apple) and does it support controller? if so what controller
If you're using a mac, download bootcamp it should work, as for how well it works, i do not know how to translate mac specs into pc counterparts, it is controller compatible i have used xbox 360 wired and ps3 controllers, if for some reason it does not recognize your controller try http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/ beware after the free trial it costs money.
What DRM is this?
Just a CD key as far as I know.
Does this game still have online support post-GameSpy shutdown?
hi ! well i dont play MP anymore, but this article from PC GAMES say : While EA are flailing about, trying to find a solution to their GameSpy service shutdown woes, Bungie have been secretly working with top men to ensure that their game lives on. Halo: Combat Evolved will receive a patch that will ensure the game's multiplayer lobby will work "just as it always has". The patch was announced on the Halo-Fixes forum "A small group has been quietly preparing for the shutdown of the GameSpy Master Server (which provides the list of Halo servers) and they are finally ready to discuss their work. The group consists of Roger Wolfson aka Sawnose (of Bungie), Btcc22 (of HAC2), Kornman00 (of OpenSauce) and myself, Technut (of PQ Clan). "As a result of their work, especially Btcc22 and Roger, Bungie will be releasing version 1.0.10 of Halo PC and Halo CE soon, which will include the fix for the Lobby!" There's no release date for the patch, but Technut is planning to release more information within the next couple of days. PS: yep patch already out if you want ! http://halo-fixes.findforum.net/t36-bungie-officially-releases-patch-110-includes-the-lobby-fix
does Game Spy still running the server
no....not this halo
In I Spy Fantasy, where is the scroll in the wizards room?
it is the rolled up paper with the ribbon around it laying on the desk
I see these I spy game for sale list "Older Version" what is the difference between the old and new version? Somelistings do not mention old or new...
I think it depends on which operating system you are using. We have the old versions and they still work on our recient up grade to Vista but there are some glitchs showing up that were never there when we were running Windows 98.
Is this the cable for older style S controller?
That's what I thought. But sadly, no.
What is that cable used for?
It is a replacement break-away cable for original xbox controllers.
can i use a xbox 360 controller if i dont have a original controller?
Unfortunately no. An original Xbox console controller is required. The cable worked great for my needs though.
Judging by the picture the connector is the same connector for the wired Xbox 360 controller, so can I use my 360 controller for the OG Xbox?
Sorry. I dont know. I have the original x box
Do they offer this product for XBOX 360? Thanks, John.
I don't know I am not the seller. I purchase this item for the original x-Box
Is SMB 3 more difficult than SMB 2 in your opinion?
SMB 3 is easier.
How many levels are in the game?
There are 8 world's with about 88 levels between them if you count fortress and castles 8 mini boss fights and 8 boss fights
Do the graphics look the same as the NES version?
They are better than the NES. Think Super NES type graphics.
Does it come with the bonus level card?
I think it depends on who's selling it, but I didn't get them from the person I ordered from. I don't have an eReader anyway, so I wasn't really looking for them in the first place.

How do you install marine mania and dinosaur digs?This only lets me install the regular Zoo Tycoon.
You have to either use another disk to install or choose the setup for the other two somewhere in game or at title.

How do I install this on windows 8? I just got it and I'm trying to install it
Sorry, I haven't tried to install it on a Windows 8 computer. I have it installed on two Windows 7 computers and it runs fine so I would think it would work on 8. As i recall it took a couple attempts to get it installed on them but I simply installed it using the disks.

WPA Security: Does this product offer WPA - Personal or WPA2 settings for the Security along with WEP?
No, it does not. Only offers WEP. I had to drop my network down to WEP to use this adapter for my xbox.
XBox 360 Compatible? Does this work with XBox 360, too?
Yes it does.
power source? does this come with batteries?
uses AC outlet.
compatible with netgear gateways/routers??
the netgear gateway cg814wg v2 is compatible with xbox-live, but you have to make sure you buy it yourself. if you let the cable company give you one, the company's firmware will be on the gateway and there is no way to tell if it will work because alot of comcast customers,"i'm one of them" keep getting kicked offline as soon as i connect to xbox live and they don't have servicemen that can fix it
Encyption: Is there any way to reset the password.
Reset the router. Most routers have a button on the back that you push and hold in with a pencil tip or something for so many seconds. This will reset everything to factory defaults (including the password). Look up the specific router model on the Linksys website for setup instructions.
how exactly do you set this up if you have a 360 and no encryption: basically how do you do this?
You've gotta use your PC, I think, attach it to your network and go directly to the device via browser..its IP should be 192.168.x.x - check the manual. Login with admin/admin or admin/blank password and put in your wifi info. You should be good to go!
does it work with Windows 8
While I can't give you a 100% as I don't use Win 8 (and neither does anybody i know, its REALLY unpopular here) it works great in Win 7 and if it works in 7 it nearly always works with 8.
does this joystick work with windows 7?
Simple answer: Yes!
Any documentation included; e.g., manual indicating # of buttons, adjustments (if any), etc? If not, where is the best place to obtain?
Logitech says their joystick is indeed packaged with a manual. But you can also find one here: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/attack-3-joystick
what operating systems does it use?
any one you want. xp ,7, it is a usb stick and will work on any available usb port. also comes with a install disk and instructions on how to calibrate! hope this helps
dose it work with the xbox 360?
No
Does it come with the install discs?
No, didn't need one. I just plugged it in and went right to it. My OS is Windows 7.
The Joystick is it in 3 action 1- aileron 2- elevator 3 -rudder In anther word, do sit have twisted action, turn right and left ,thank you
Not sure, sorry
How well does it work with/on Mac?
I only used it on windows. Sorry
Does this work with a Mac?
I am not sure. I use it for windows vista. I think Logitech has a website that should tell you.
does it work with Windows?
yes, for sure Win 7 and should work with xp
does it crash
Nope.
Do you have to be connected to the Internet for single play?
No
What version is it? (As in, is it version 1.1.641.0)
Where exactly would I be able to locate this information?? ( I checked under my amazon orders as well as on the ad. I am at work currently and am unable to open the program on my laptop at this time if that is where I would find it.)
Is this game compatible with WIndows 7?
It does work on Windows 7; however, i would highly recommend patching/modding it so that it runs smoother. Due to its age, the game suffers from frequent crashes that may hinder gameplay if you don't save frequently (every 5 minutes).
Will it run on Windows 8.1?
Yep, runs ok. In game you may have to go to the video settings and change rendering to "software" instead of "hardware" to make it run smooth.
I know it says ONLY compatible with XP but with most PC games are able to form to new OS's like Windows 7. True for this?
I bought a new Laptop in 2012 with windows 7 and it plays this game just fine.
Can you play it without internet connection?
Yes.
Key code doesn't work -- any ideas on how to resolve this problem?
If you bought a used copy, then you need to get a transfer of ownership from the original owner, and notify EA Games. Otherwise you might have a pirated copy. Also, before you do any of that, check your Cap Locks key, and retyping the key code.
Is the disc copy Mac compatible?
No
Do I need to play previous Sim city games to play Sim city 4
No
does it crash
Nope.

There's no way you're selling the console with all those games for $58.50, right?
be very careful of what you are looking at. the picture you see on the opening page may not be what each seller is selling. you have to read there comments. some sellers sell just the console, some sell console and cord without controllers. YOU REALLY have to reach what EACH seller is selling. hope this helps
All I want to know does this PS2 come with everthing already because the las PS2 that I got didn't come with anything at all whatsoever even though it said that everthing came with it so does that 1 come with everything already or not?
honestly your better off just getting a refund like a did because I called customer service a bunch of times and removed my review on them because they said they would send another at no charge due to the fact the other one was a month late and was returned to them with damage. son just get your money back.
What's the voltage?
For the PlayStation, it depends on what it says on your gaming system. I would check the bottom, sides etc. Commonly, it's AC220. Some outlets only run at AC 110-120. But as far as voltage goes, I've never had an issue with not having enough. I didn't know that this was a problem. Hope this helps ! : )
does it come with memory card?
Mine did. I believe it is on a per sale basis. Look in description closely. The system itself works fine. Still in use.
How long is the controller cord? Also, doesn't the PS2 make noise?
This model of the PS2 is very quite as for the cord: the standard cord is about 4ft long. Hope that helps
Is this the older and bigger play station 2
yes it is.
Does it come with Dragonball Z Boudkai Tenakichi 3?!!!!!!!!
No just the console.
Does it come with all the games and controllers and other stuff as shown in the picture or is it just the console and is it compatible with rockband?
Just the controls1 and wires w.
Is this still for sale and in working condition? If so I will make the purchase NOW! Thank you kindly :)
Yes it is still for sale and works fine but remember you're only getting the consul
good afternoon could tell me if it comes with controls?
The one I purchased came with controllers
Does anyone know if this game will play on Windows 7, 8, or Vista? Thanks.
Game runs awesome on my Windows 8 laptop. Due to that, it should run great on Windows 7 as well. If that's not enough, I have friends using Windows 7 that play the game fine. As for Vista, can't say for sure, but probably fine, since the game still works on Windows XP and 7/8, the older and newer versions.
If I don't want to install through the dvd, can I just redeem the code on steam?
No the boxed copy of Morrowind has no CD key to enter to redeem.
Please advertise that this runs through the steam client. I expedited the shipping and basically paid 4 times for something i didnt want.
Call amazon customer service and they should give you a full refund, as they did for me. I too, was fooled by the reseller's bait and switch tactic. When I called amazon customer service, my agent said he could see multiple similar complaints in the history. He immediately. Issued a full refund and even told me that I need not bother returning the product.
Does this have to be installed through steam? I don not have internet on my gaming computer.
Yes, the DVD version I received required that you start the installation through Steam. I also own the much older CD version which does not require steam. The files are read from the DVD after the installation is started, but you still have to have an internet connection to do it.
i want to buy a disk version of this game i need to know if i need know is if i have to buy it on steam too or if the disk will even function
I believe, once you buy the disc version, its as simple as installing it, along with steam. the pc edition I bought works just fine.
do you need an internet connection, thanks
no you dont need it to play the game but you do need internet connection to download the game because it uses steam to download it
Does the physical copy of the game come with a map insert?
No, no instruction booklet either.
does the game have a control option to adapt to a windows xbrox controller?
It appears that the answer is yes though I was content with the PC controls; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RzMd5RaPuI
Does this come in a bog box?
Somewhat. If I remember the dimensions it was roughly 12" long by 6" wide by 2" high.
Do you have to buy the game discs (currently $6.93) and the game code (currently $19.99) both separately? Is that how it works?
Nope. Just the nineteen dollar one and you activate it on Steam, then download the game to your computer. Nothing to it. You can download it over and over if you update a hard drive or get a new computer. But it is your game, you own it. You can back it up to anyplace you like on your computer to have a "local" copy of it if you like. Been using Steam since it was Valve and never had any issues. Steam keeps your games updated automatically if you desire too.

I am trying to get this joystick at http://amzn.to/UkGz6n to work with my orginal XBox (XBox before XBox 360 and One). Will this adapter work?

Hi, No, you need to play it on a pc or laptop or tablet with a Windows or Macintosh operating system. Thanks for asking.
I have windows 7 will this game work with that?
yes it will but not mac computers and I cant use the one I bought .
Does these work on Ipad
No, this does not work on iPad. It is a CD-ROM. You may be able to find similar/comparable apps on the App Store. Some Phonics/reading apps we like are Montessori Crosswords, Super Why and Meme tales. They are all under $5 and align with preschool/ kindergarten common core language arts standards.
will this run ok on windows 8?
I couldnt get it to run on my windows 7...kept freezing and locking up the computer. Don't know if I had a defective disc or what but I ended up sending mine back.
Will it run on OSX 10.6 without classic?
I can't get Reader Rabbit to run on my windows computers XP or later. I don't know what OSX is. I am disappointed because my children loved reader rabbit and my grandson did too.
Will this work with a mac, specifically OS X version 10?
No. It doesn't even work on newer Windows 7 or 8. Don't buy this crap.
Does this software require an always on internet connection?
No
can this software work with a newer computer
It might
is it a c.d or dvd
It is a CD
Does it run on Windows 7 or 8?
No... it's a great product, but it doesn't run on Windows 7 or 8. You'll need an older Windows XP to run it. I wish the publisher would revamp it for the newer OS.
Will this cd play in the car cd player?
Hi, No, you need to play it on a pc or laptop or tablet with a Windows or Macintosh operating system. Thanks for asking.

yes it will but not mac computers and I cant use the one I bought .
Does these work on Ipad
No, this does not work on iPad. It is a CD-ROM. You may be able to find similar/comparable apps on the App Store. Some Phonics/reading apps we like are Montessori Crosswords, Super Why and Meme tales. They are all under $5 and align with preschool/ kindergarten common core language arts standards.

I couldnt get it to run on my windows 7...kept freezing and locking up the computer. Don't know if I had a defective disc or what but I ended up sending mine back.

Hello, sorry for delay. Perhaps you can run it without problems, but it is a old game. I couldnt used it. I recommend you to buy some more new.

Yes, it does. However, it will require you to run it in compatibility mode and make some other changes to get it to work without crashing. See: http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/165797/kotor-2-freezes-on-movies for the fix.
Free roam? Do you have to be jedi/sith?
I'm not sure what you mean my "free roam" but you do have to be a jedi or a sith. You can also be a "gray jedi" which is basically in-between, and you'll get some different dialog and benefits/penalties for that as well.
Is this compatible with windows 8.1?
I bought this long before the release of Windows 8.1. (This was a gift for younger brother.) I don't want to assume that it's not compatible. Do you participate on any online forums that focus on these type of games? They would be better able to answer this question for you.

what type of plug????
It is a pin plug and not a USB. If needed, you can purchase an adapter to convert a USB into a pin plug.
just like to know if there is a volume control button ?
Not that I'm aware of or see listed. This is a very basic board. I didn't even know keyboards came with volume control.
Is this keyboard compatible with the hp f1523 model?
Honestly, I am not positive, but I use it on a Dell and it works fine. I use an adapter for the pin plug into a USB port. At times, I have had to unplug it and then plug it back in if it does not work. Bottom line, for me the comfort of this keyboard far outweighs the occasional inconvenience. Hope this helps.
What are the electrical ratings for the keyboard? On the back it will tell you the rated Voltage and Current. Please tell me what the ratings.
5V==50mA
are the function keys separated in groups of four? I am blind and that is easier to use
Yes. That top line is as follows. The Esc key is on the left end, by itself. Then, moving to the right you have a space the size of a key, then F1 F2 F3 F4; small space, F5 F6 F7 F8; small space, F9 F10 F11 F12; small space Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Pause.
can this be used for shooting space games?
I use mine for TIE Fighter, X-wing, and X-wing Alliance. It is designed to be used in flight simulators and space fighter type games. I hope this helps you out.
Is it usable in the left hsnd?
No. It is molded to fit a right hand. I never even thought how a lefty would have to use it.....
mac users
No
Is this windows 8.1 compatible?
Yes it is, I have been using mine under windows 8.1. It works very well,
I am assuming, it is analog? Want to us it as an economical substitute for an E-brake on a racing sim.
Yes, its analog as well as an analog throttle control. The hat is a 4-way digital.
Does it work with PC arcade games like Pac man, Space Invaders?
Yes
Can you use 2 together (left and right)?
I don't see why not if your computer can handle it. JJ
Will this work with Microsoft Flight Simulator X, and does it rotate on the vertical axis? Does the joystick rotate?
Yes
Will this Joystick work on an older computer using windows 98?
I think so. it uses a USB plug so if your older PC has a USB port then it will work.
will this joystick work for atari 2600 computer version????
If you are talking about the atari 2600 EMULATOR your best guess is to check the web site of the developer. Being and emulator fan myself I dont think so because the emulator does not work when you partially move the joystick (the stick is analog if I remember correctly). What you would need to try is for example a 4 way joystick or an 8 way joystick. I dont have time to install the emulator and test it today, sorry.
Hi, I am from Germany. Is this the US Version? I have the German an UK version, but theres no Honda Civic. Is here on this the Honda?

is this game compatible to 8.1 window pc
Why yes.
Is this compatible with the DS lite?
No. It plugs into the same port as a wired GBA link cable, so it only works with Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player. If you want to access multiplayer functions of Game Boy Advance games, you'll need those systems or a Game Boy Micro with a special adaptor.
Does the other gameboy need a wireless adapter, too? Also does this work with a GBA SP to a GB Pocket?
Yes
If you and a friend were playing Gameboy Color games, would this still act as a connection?
No. You'd need a Game Boy Color link cable (or Game Boy universal link cable), which is going to be hard to find as there are so many knock-offs. A genuine Nintendo cable will say 'Nintendo' near at least one of the ends. If you can't find one, trading Pokmon is possible using multiple N64 Transfer Paks and Pokmon Stadium 2, but for other games, you may be out of luck.
what does this do?
This GBA wireless adapter is for the Gameboy Advance and Gameboy Advance systems (not compatible with the GBA Micro), and replaces the GBA link cable for games that support it, most commonly Pokemon Emerald, Pokemon Fire Red, and Pokemon Leaf Green.
Do you need a wireless adapter on both Gameboys to play wirelessly?
Each additional system needs its own wireless adapter to connect, yes. However, this is a wireless adapter for Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Player only; other Game Boy systems and Game Boy (Color) games are not compatible.
Can I use this with a gba sp and connect to a ds lite (wirelessley) with this?
No. The DS lite uses different wireless frequencies and cannot play GBA games in multiplayer mode, period. You need to use multiple GBA systems.
is this a base with interchangeable keyboards (to go from gaming-office use) where you flip the keyboard upside down to get a style?
Interchangeable - yes. You get two different keysets - one regular, one gaming (WASD keys on the left and others). The keysets have a clip on the side that you flip up to change out and flip down to lock in place. You don't flip anything upside down. Hope this answers your question.

Works great in Windows 7 HOWEVER I never found win7 drivers for the presets. I use it in games daily and I don't miss the presets.

I don't think that this keyboard will work with a mac.You should also really check steel series website on legacy products for that info an any other info for this keyboard.

Can you have the butterfly key section on the right side of the board. I'm a lefty and can't find a left handed gaming keyboard.
No, the keyboard only "plugs-in" one way; with the butterfly on the left side.

This keyboard is not wireless. I don't use wireless keyboards or mice for gaming so I can't respond to the second question.
For the Gold edition, it looks like it holds both AoM and AoM: Titans Expansion. Does it? Also, will both of these work on Windows 8.1? THANK YOU!!!
It does have both AoM & AoM: Titans. The interesting part is the Code/Key is the same for everyone of these you purchase and it will not play with other original versions of AoM or AoM: Titans in a LAN game. On the plus side you can uninstall the versions on the other LAN computers you have and install this version and then it will play LAN game mode. Interestingly, once installed it does NOT require the DVD either. I purchased three copies of this to game with two of my original versions for LAN gaming. I was a bit upset to find out they all have the same Code/Key and really annoyed to find they wouldn't play with my originals. Then I decided to try uninstalling my originals and installing this version and my LAN games were running fine (5 player fun). When it comes to Windows 8.1 I'm not sure as I've only run this on Windows XP SP3 + Windows 7 Home Edition. Hope this helps! When it comes to

Right click the set up file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab. b. Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode box. c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous Operating System, then tap or click OK.
Do I need to purchase the game twice to do multiplayer with a second member of the family?
If you are talking about the LAN between people on the same network, you do require two copies of the same game so you can both play, one for each computer because the serial key is unique to each installation, and also because you both require a CD on each of the computers for the program to run.
I recieved the product and it didnt have a product key. What do I do?
its been so long since i ordered it. i had a hard time also finding the product key. it is either in the case or on the case. im pretty sure it doesnt say" product key" its just a bunch of numbers and maybe letters. is there anyway you can bypass it? are you trying to play online? if so you will most likely need it. if your just playing off line, im pretty sure you can bypass it. if you cant find it, let me know and i will look for my game. its been years since ive played.
Titans says: Please insert the Age of Mythology: The Titans CD-ROM, select OK, and restart. How to get past this? Thanks!
You should be able to find a serial key online. If you want to play online you have to buy the steam version (enhanced version).
Can I redeem it on Steam? If not does thIs still work on windows and still able to use online? How many people can play online at a time?

When I saw the extended edition on steam, I bought it. But i also bought the goals edition from amazon. Problem: They messed up badly with the multiplayer network (Doesn't matter how fast your connection is and how beasty your computer is). Even if played via lan, the lag totally kills the fun, and at least for myself and everyone I know, makes the multiplayer beyond frustrating. -If you intend to play the campaign and single player ai skirmishes only, go ahead and enjoy. HOWEVER, -If you want to buy this for the MULTIPLAYER, - DON'T BUY THIS! (unless you can put up with massive lag) do not know about transfer to steam as i bought mine from steam. i hope this helps you this is all i know. oh number of multi-players is pending on the server you connect with at the time.
Any kind of internet activation required for this game to play?
Go to voobly.com, make an account, download the client, and then you can go on the AoM: Titans lobby and play online through that client.

Is it for Windows 7
Hello Jaime, The answer to your question is yes you can. In fact I use this as well on my Windows 8 Computer as well. I dont think that Logitech still has the drivers on there servers to download any longer (but again I am not shore they may) but I would plug it into my USB and my computer installs/downloads the drivers when it is connected. The other method that I have used was I would run windows updates and it will find the newer drivers for it. I hope this helped you out.

Yes
My present controller's joy sticks are sticky on center making it hard to steer the cars in my racing game... is this controller good for racing games?
I've had no trouble using it in racing games. The joysticks are good for just about any game really. The holes are square so you might need to learn to control your thumbs a bit more but it's honestly nothing that will bug you for very long if at all.
Can this be used to play games on a Mac Pro?
Absolutely
Does this work on Vista? I own Windows Vista and would like to get this so is this compatible with Vista?
The controller states that it works for Windows Vista.However it seems to be the most Compatible with outdated OS's Windows 98,2000,ME & XP! not 7 or 8.
Will this work with games that have controller support on Steam? Assuming that is that they are all pretty similar.
Yes
Can this gamepad play emulators?
Don't see why it wouldn't. I have one, and use it with Project 64, ZSnes, ROCKnes, Kega Fusion, Chanka, and others all the time with no problems. It's d-pad is ok for a standard cross type. But I have an older Thrustmaster Firestorm Dual Power 3, and I think it's dpad is more comfortable. Lots of luck finding one though--like I said, they're older gamepads, and getting hard to find now.

This controller does work on Mac through USB. I have a 2006 MacBook and this controller works great. The wireless receiver plugs into your USB port. The Mac recognized the controller automatically and that was that!
android tablets: Does it work on android tablets like Asus transformer infinity rtf700f?

I'm interested in a career as a professional Helicopter pilot, is the X52 a good choice for someone who wants to practice Helicopter flight without pedals?
Its a pretty good stick if that's what your asking...as for closeness to a helicopter stick I'm not sure of but as far as simulations go this is a upper mid range stick I think its worth the money. I use it for dcs a-10 simulator and its excellent and that's a very detail oriented simulator
What type of plug does this Joystick use?
The joystick connects to the throttle module with a mini-DIN connector, and the throttle module in turn connects to your computer via USB. The joystick cannot be used separately from the throttle module.
mouse on x52 throttle doesn't work
Go here: http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/x52.html and go to the download tab at the top and download the correct drivers and software for your X52 Flight Control System. Make sure it is NOT the PRO version, unless you own a pro version. Your mouse throttle could be broken or a bad USB cable. I use mine for Microsoft FSX games. If you are using it for something else other than FSX, then that is out of my department.
Does this have the rudder control on the backside of the throttle like the x45 does?
Yes a roller is on the back of the throttle that can be assigned as rudder control
Can you use joystick separate from the throttle? On some flight sims I just want to use the joystick by itself. Thanks.
Likely no. The joystick plugs in to the throttle with a PS/2 Connector, and the Throttle goes to the PC with USB. I haven't personally tried connecting the throttle to a PS/2 connector on my PC, but I don't imagine it'd work. Not sure why there's not a picture of the connectors on Amazon, but http://www.techwarelabs.com/reviews/peripherals/saitek_x52/images/Complete%20Contents%20saitek%20X52.jpg shows the connector types.
What are the base dimensions for the two parts? I need to fit in 6.5" space.
Both are 6 and 5/8 by 6 and 5/8. If your space is really that exact measurement with no leeway, they won't quite fit.
How will this work with Elite Dangerous?
That is what I bought it for. It works great for me. You can also setup the profile in ED the way you prefer. Takes a little adjusting and tweeking. So when you first start in ED use the trainer to test and get all the buttons assigned the way you want. I did not like the canned ED setup for the X52. So I did a custom setup and tested in the trainer before using it in game. Good luck
does it work with mac
I do not believe so. After checking on the Saitek website for drivers, you seem to only be able to download drivers for Windows.

yourself fitness: can you use this on your dvd player?
No, there's no standard video DVD for it. It's too customized and complex of a program to run in a DVD player. It exists for PC, Play Station 2, xbox (the old one, but I think the new one might play it), and for the Wii under a different name. These are the only formats I'm aware of, and I've done quite a bit of research. I personally own the PC and Wii versions.

How many computers can this be loaded on? Interested in the number; like only one computer or up to three computers .
I really don't know. WordPerfect licensing is less restrictive than other brands but I do know that WordPerfect Suite 8 is a very good inexpensive program for general word processing. I'll look in the literature that came with it when I get home and get back to you.
How many computers will I be able to install WordPerfect 8? Would like to load on both of my computers.

Do the pieces lay in the position that they fit together, so you don't have to rotate them. Does it have a back ground picture so you can tell if things are fitting together right.
yes to both. no need to rotate. If I recall they even click together and stay put together. You can have a shadow like photo in the puzzle field to help place your pieces or you can have a small box/window up of the photo being worked on.
After a puzzle is put together &amp; it ask do you want to save it , yes no or cancel. The only way I have found to start a different one is to click no, but then you have to go back to the icon on the desk &amp; start everthing over. Is there any way to avoid...
Yes, click on open on the drop down menu (file) first, then you will be asked if you want to save your current puzzle. After you answer you will be taken to the multiple lines of puzzle choices by theme.

After a puzzle is put together &amp; it ask do you want to save it , yes no or cancel. The only way I have found to start a different one is to click no, but then you have to go back to the icon on the desk &amp; start everthing over. Is there any way to avoid...
Yes, click on open on the drop down menu (file) first, then you will be asked if you want to save your current puzzle. After you answer you will be taken to the multiple lines of puzzle choices by theme.
Can some one tell me the step by step way to install this item so I cn use it.
the jigsaws galore isn't worth the money we paid for it I threw it away they did a poor job you are wasting your time to try to install it, go to big fish web site they have some jigsaw game to download very good ones they are called Jigsaw Boom 3 and jigsaw 365 not very expensive and they are real jigsaw puzzles very user friendly
Why is this listed as a Model 1 when the pictures clearly show a Model 2? Very misleading, I think you should change the title to Model 2, I was specifically looking for a Model 1. This isn't it.
To make matters worst when I received the console it did not come with any cords nor did the console work.
any one know if u can use different ac adaptors for the model 1? mine doesnt work at all and the ac adaptor feels really tight when i plug in mine
Yes. I used a genesis/Nes adaptor for mine that have two cords in one adaptor. Works great.
Does it work on a modern TV?
No sorry
I lost the cord to my game system and want to know if anyone knows what cords to look for
I believe you would need TV and Power hookups if I'm not mistaken. You can look and find them on ebay.
is it the cheaper model 1
The pictured is a model 1, and the model 2 is typically cheaper if ever so slightly. The model 3 tends to be more but not a whole lot more
Why is almost every genesis not have the cords and controller(s)
Probably bc they have been lost along the way... the model 1 came out in 1989... gone with the wind I guess... or broke at some point
I want to order the new Sega. would like to know if it's sealed or not if not what is included in the box
I'm not entirely sure what you are asking.... if you want to know what NORMALLY comes with a sega genesis should it be complete in the box you will need the following for it to be operational. The system itself, AV or Rca cables (Rca are pretty common today and are colored red white and yellow, while AV has a small box about half way down the cable and has a metal jack that screws into the T.V.), a power adapter and a controller. Obviously a game will be required for the system to be fully operational but luck for you genesis games that are popular happen to cost little to no money. You could probably get Sonic 1-3 for less than 20 bucks combined.
Is this a working system or does it need fixing?
Depends on the listing. Some work some don't
Would you please provide the FCC ID on the bottom of the system?
No
Mechanical or nawwww?
Nawwwww
will this keyboard work with windows 8 or only 7
yes, I hooked it up to my 8.1 laptop and it worked just fine
Lighted keyboards won't work with KVM switch ???
I have the iomega USB KVM switch. My Saitek keyboard's lights worked fine. The trick is that I had it plugged into the USB port on the PC, turned the lights on, then plugged it into the KVM switch. Works fine!
Will this work with Vista? Anyone know if this Saitek keyboard works with Vista?
Yes. My girlfriend bought one earlier this year for her Vista PC, and we just plugged it in the USB port and it worked. It still works fine to this day. She loves it. I personally own a Logitech G15, and it is better, but also costs more. In this $40 and under price range though, this Saitek is the best available. There are other illuminated keyboards you can get for this price or even less, but according to my research, they are not nearly as good. The Saitek should last you a good long time. Best bang for the buck in this category. My girlfriend paid $34 for hers at Walmart. I think they still carry them as of this writing.
Will this work on a PSP model 1001?
Yes, that is the model I bought it for. I had no issues at all with it.

What is the voltage of this charger
6volt I believe...
How many wireless controller do it come with
It comes with one controller but, you'll probably wanna buy another so it can charge while you play with the other. Also being that the controllers charge doesn't last as long as a new one.
Is it backwards compatible?
If you get the CECH 01A then yes. Anything after, no.
is it cracked or it takes only original games? like does it take copied games?
No what I meant was that it was broken due to how it was treated by the owner. It plays ps3, ps2, and ps1 games just fine. No it does not play copied games.
Is this ps3 60gb backward compatible? and what is it's model number? thanks!

I would like to play multiplayer between a DSi with Mario Kart DS and a newer 3DS console. Do I need to purchase another Mario Kart DS for the 3DS?
Honestly, I'm not sure if dsi can play with a 3ds :/ but if it can I would first try it through one cartridge via the "download"play which js how you access multiplayer with one cartrige. If you are able to play with dsi and 3Ds then I would assume if you want to use all courses and characters you'd have to have another catridge. I'm not sure if you can do multiplayer with dsi and 3Ds :/ if you can let me know, that would be interesting.
If I buy a used version of this game for my DSI can the progress be deleted? Thanks!
Yes you can

Why did the price go up so fast? I got this game for $1 now its $30?
The prices are always changing on videogames. depends on the demand it has at the time of searching.. Most prices are alright. Though 1$, you can never beat that. 30$ is proabbaly for a brand new one, though buying used is always an alternative.

Is this game legit, like when you buy it you can download it and play? this is not a scam right?
If you buy it new yeah it's legit and you can play it. If you get it usd the key won't work and it won't let you play. I had to find out the hard way rather than going to steam and buying the game download direct.
Does it work on windows 8.1 ?
Yes
Is this keyboard mechanical?
What is your definition of mechanical? This keyboard is can be programmed, has a small led monitor, which I use all the time. Keys are lit and and you can run your dvd and volume. Plus it has a full number pad. You can create macro commands for gaming. Keyboard is a bit old school, but I like it.
Mac Compatability???? Is this keyboard mac compatable?
This is indeed mac compatible. You would have to go to the logitech website and download drivers. However if you do not want to download said drivers it will still work just fine, the lcd will only have very basic functions and the G-keys will only perform default actions in whichever program you are in.
G15 vs Razer? Anybody have the pros and cons between this keyboard and the Razer Tarantula?
I just picked up the Razor and i have to say either i got a bad key board or this thing just sucks the big one. They keys are totally unresponsive when you type, unless you press down hard on them. Something about walking in the game and pausing every 3 steps because they keys arent decting that your actually pressing them. I wont even talk about the pvp experience excpet to say that my death was swift...or more swife then usual :) My roomate hopped on the computer to take care of some business and even he said that this key board bites the big one. He was attempted to type up some documents and asked if I could put my old key board back on so that he could actully get his work done due to the keys not responding when he used them. Guess i will purchase the G15 for my gaming experience because i am going to take this dam razor and use it to help improve my skeet shooting skills.
Does this keyboard only work with Pentium processors? Did I read the description correctly?
"or compatible"
Help! How do you LOAD the Crazy Machines game?? Any suggestions???
Are the hardware requirements met?
is it compatible with windows 7?
I played and reviewed the game on Windows 7. The only Crazy Machines game that didn't work initially was Crazy Machines 2. I have reviews of these games on my website if you're interested (follow the link in my profile) as well as fixes for CM2.
Is it suitable for a 5 yr old?
It might be a little tricky for a 5 year old. I'm guessing this would be better for a child around 7-8 years old. That being said this is a pretty old game and we experienced problems with it on a newer (2004 iMac). Not sure if the same would apply for a windows PC but when we purchased it it was a "universal" powerpc binary and the windows version was for windows 95.

Don't give up too soon .. but if stuck they can get you moving again. Both sites are in German, but you can figure the solutions out either using the pictures or using a website translator.

Does this remote work with Xbox Live? I need it to work with NetFlix that I'm streaming through my Xbox.
I'm pretty sure it will. I use it with the amazon app on Xbox and also my local cable providers app.
The item is the same like the one you post in the picture or is the small control version ?
The one I received its the same as pictured. Great remote for using the 360 as a media centre.
This is the large remote control like the picture or the small version ?
It is 8.25" long X 1" thick X 1.75 to 2" wide at the tip. Just like the picture.
Will this remote work with/control the HD DVD player add-on drive?
Yes
I noticed the top picture has the Green MCE button and the second (bottom one in wrapper) does not have the Green MCE button. Which is accurate?
I bought 2 of these (from a different seller) in 9/2013 and they both had the green mce button. Go for it, if it doesn't have it then return it.
I have a receiver to use my 360 controller on my PC. Will I be able to use this for my PC also?
I haven't tried using this remote on my computer yet, but my old computer remote I had, worked on my 360. So I would think it should work. It obviously sends out the same signals. It is made by Microsoft, so why wouldn't it work with the computer?
Will this control the DVR functions in WMC? I have one of the new remotes and it lacks many of the functions that you would expect it to have.
Works great with wmc extender. It's what I use it for.
Will this work for a Mac?
If you have an adapter for a VGA input yes. Mac uses other inputs depending on what year your mac is.
I got an xbox 360 elite and my monitor is a samsung syncmaster s22b310. Will it work with it?
If your monitor has a VGA input, it should work.
will it work with the xbox 360 E?
It will work with an Xbox 360 elite
Will ghosting occur with this cable if I attach it to an extended male-to-female vga cable that connects to my monitor?
no it even comes with an adaptor to do so.
So will this connect an Xbox 360 to an older, non digital tv -picture and sound??
Non digital tv- picture? If it has a female VGA port then it should work. The red and white is for a separate sound output. So like speakers. You can also get av to aux 3.5mm cord.
does this cable fit the black slim xbox 360... need help ??
If the back of your Xbox 360 has a port that looks like the trapezoidal one in this picture (http://www.spainsellers.com/images/Xbox-360-Slim.jpg), then it SHOULD work, but no guarantees. I would suggest an HDMI cable instead of this, if the monitor/screen you're trying to connect to has an HDMI port.
would this fit a xbox 360 slim need help?
I am using it on a 360S
Has anyone experienced any display ghosting with this product?
Not with this cable. I tried a couple other aftermarket ones that were terrible. The Microsoft one is the real deal.
does this work with the older, white xbox 360?
It sucks, don't buy it.
would it work on a non hdmi tv?
Yes
I purchased one of the older models of the XBOX 360 (120 GB with no wireless). Is this the same cable that came packaged with that version?
Yes. At some point they switched from this AV cable to an HDMI. This is the original cable that was packaged with the first couple revisions of the console.
if im using the blue green red on one tv andyellow red white on another tv will the video show on both tvs.
Unfortunately no simply because it's not a spliter. There is a tiny switch on it to change from the HD mode and standard. It's one or the other.
This is to make the graphics better correct?
Yes and certain games like mine craft need it to use multi player
I have the new xbox model. It's called the Xbox E . With this model it only has a hdmi port. The picture makes i look like it will fit. Will it work?
You answered your own question actually; it is only able to use an HDMI cable. AV/Component output is not supported for that model so this product would serve you no purpose.
Where does the 5.1 sound come from? I see stereo RCA plugs and a possible hole for output of sound. Fiber Optic cable? The 8' length works for me.
I'm going to guess that it comes from creative marketing. Most likely they are referring to the fact that the audio outputs can be connected to a surround sound to achieve 5.1.
the cable does not seem to fit into the x box anywhere. Do I have the wrong cable? Or is there somewhere it should connect?
should be in the back near the HDMI input
Does the video come out of the component cables (red,gren,blue) and the AV cable (yellow) or both? What is the yellow cable for?
The yellow cable is for standard definition television . plugging it in won't do anything. You have your audio cables (red and white) and your HD componet cables (Red green blue) and standard definition video cable(yellow) if you are not using an HD TV with component plugs such as an CRT TV the yellow video cable needs to be plugged in to the color coded slot (sometimes represented as a Y above another color slot)
i plug it all in but there's no signal when on hdtv?
Ensure that the correct color connectors on the component end are plugged into the correct TV jacks, verify the switch on the Microsoft connector is set to HDTV, on the TV set the video selection to the appropriate input. Remember that the solid red and white plugs are the left and right audio, if still having problems the cable could be bad. Good luck!
Does this cable replace the need for an HDMI cable?
No
Do you have to download this game to play or can you take the cd and use it on another computer?
it is downloaded. I have the same disc downloaded on two different laptops.
I want a cd that I can download to my pc and not have to interact with other sites and don't have ads - just a icon my husband can click on &amp; play?
Amazon Forwarded This As I Purchased Pretty Goo Solitaire For This PurposE. I Am Very Happy With It. Many Games At Different LevEls Of Play. Play Everyday And Love It. Just Load The Cd And YOu Get An Icon And Then Select To Play. When You Find A GaMe You Like Just Minimize It And It Is There To Be Played Again.
Does it have tripeaks
Yes it does have a tripeaks version called Triple Peaks in the Regular games folder
Mainly want simple Spider Solitaire for WIndows Vista - will this suffice?
This version has several spider games and the original too. This should be great for you.
DOES THIS HAVE AGNES THREE &amp; INTERNMENT
Yes, it has both of them
Does it have vegas solitare?
no
Does this cd have the ORIGINAL CLASSIC SOLITAIRE???? I already purchased a cd that had 100's but did NOT have the classic game I wanted.....
Yes, they call it Klondike in this edition.
I'm looking for simple games such as Number 10, Coppermine, Buffalo Bill.Does this or any other software have these?
Found Number 10 and Buffalo Bill. Pretty good solitaire is terrific, has simple games and games that require a calculus degree. There are hundreds and hundreds of games and you can get new ones if you own the software. Enjoy! The perfect solitaire CD for any solitaire fan.
1) does the freecell have a timer? If so, can it be turned off?
I didn't see one, if it has one it can be turned off.---Yank
will this work for windows 8.1?
Hi Sylvia, I run W7 Pro on my 3 computers, so I can not answer your question. I did look at the documentation that came in the box. It does NOT state which OSs are supported. You can email Thomas Warfield at support@goodsol.com. Tom wrote the program. Bill R
so u get the code right away or does it get sent to u by mail?
Sent to you in the mail.
Are the codes used for the xbox live or will we be able to use the codes after we purchase it
It's the XBOX live code, once used, it's no longer a good code, it's just for 12 months, with one month extra.
So if you have an Xbox One AND an Xbox 360, you need two seperate cards?
No, the card counts towards your profile and not the specific console, so one card is all you need
My card did not look like this and codes said invalid what can I do now?
If you get an invalid card, contact the seller
im going to get an Xbox one do you recommend this card to play online
My friends tell me the same cards work for both, so yes, this worked for me.
Is it a physical card that needs to be mailed, or is it a code I can have e-mailed to my account?
This particular one is a physical card. If you want a digital code, go here- http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Live-Month-Membership-Online/dp/B002VBWIP6/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1402780547&sr=1-1&keywords=xbox+live+digital+code
Hello, are these cards still valid? Because there is a newer version (the green one) Thank you.
as long as there is a code on the back it is, it's either 16 or 20 digits use edge of coin to reveal it. Good luck!
works for xbox one?
Yes, it is just a subscription to Microsoft's "Live" on-line access.
so u get the code right away or does it get sent to u by mail?
Sent to you in the mail.
Are the codes used for the xbox live or will we be able to use the codes after we purchase it
It's the XBOX live code, once used, it's no longer a good code, it's just for 12 months, with one month extra.
So if you have an Xbox One AND an Xbox 360, you need two seperate cards?
No, the card counts towards your profile and not the specific console, so one card is all you need
My card did not look like this and codes said invalid what can I do now?
If you get an invalid card, contact the seller

Will this work for Windows 8?
I'm using Windows 8.1 and it works great. You won't be able to stay on the game with CTRL/Tab, but if you save and restart every time you stop playing it will do fine.
Will this still work with Windows 7?
Yes it will work with Win 7. Plenty of people still play Sims 1 with Win 7, and I haven't heard anything about any installation problems. If you run into any, try installing it as an administrator.
Will this work for Macbook Pro? Running OS X Mavericks?
No. This is the PC version. You'd have to buy the MAC version. Just search 'The Sims Complete Collection Mac' I'm pretty sure there is in a Mac version for The Sims.
I've heard that since this is an older copy a Used copy links to one account, if I buy Used can my wife still play it + the expansions?
My used copy doesnt seem to have any problems, after i installed it, it acted ask it should, all expansions were there and working bring back memories of the good old days, just go by there possiative rating and how many good rating it has,
Which expansion packs does it include ? Does it have Apartment life ?
I don't believe it has apartment life, but I was sorely disappointed with my entire purchase of the expansion packet. I could not register any of it because they were all used
does this come with making magic?
Yes. It comes with all the expansions.
Will this work on Windows Vista?
No. You might be able to get it to work but you have to do some major work with tech support.
Is there a download version?
Yes. Just browse under "The Sims Complete Collection Download" and select from the available sites. I personally haven't downloaded any games, so I can't give you any further details. Hope this helps.
Can it work for Windows 7
Yes
is it works on windows 8?
Yes. I have GTA: SA on my computer which is running Windows 8 Pro...it runs perfectly, and without any incompatibility issues. The game doesn't have any lagging on my computer either.
Which version should I get if I wanna use mods?
I purchased the second edition and had no problems running mods, first edition will also run them, so its up to personal preference
Can anyone please help me i have windowes 8.1 and steam cant install the game it tels me invalid platform
I would try to install using compatibility mode then try to run game in compatibility mode. If that doesn't work try running directly from install folder in compatibility mode and as administrator. Some games will not work on 8.1 though.
How do you download this? is it an installer or a Steam Code? I have a Steam account so i was just wondering.
You download it.
is this a downloadable thing or a disc??
You can choose which version you would like to buy. You can choose to buy the disc or the downloaded copy
What's the difference between the first and second editions?
I think the second edition is less graphic
does it work on hp?
I don't know. Maybe so
Does this work on windows vista?
The game can work anything over Windows.XP. and it does work on vista. I had it installed on my vista
If you use this game on your PC, does it take a lot of memory?
Depends how much memory your computer may have. Best if you get like an 8 gig USB drive or an external hard drive if your not sure how much memory your computer have. It really shouldn't take much memory these days since computers come with a alot memory.
Palm Tungsten E2 Compatiblility: Is this item good for a Palm Tungsten E2?
I am on the same situation with the Palm Tungsten T5. They never mentioned Palm OS as compatible :-(

Does this include Galaxia?
It includes; Galaga and Galaxian.
does it work on 3ds?
Per nintendo.com......Almost all existing Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi games can be played on the Nintendo 3DS family of systems in 2D. With backwards compatibility, your existing portable games look and play just as well*.
Is pole position on here?
no, it is not.
One complaint on playing this on the 3ds is that some parts of the game screen were cut off. Anyone see any improvement playing this on the 3ds xl?
Sorry, I have a DSi. It works perfect on that. Haven't used a 3DS yet. Hope you get a resolution to your problem! Have a great weekend!
does this play on a DS Lite?
yes that is what I have
The images show menus in a different language. Will the game appear as such or will text be in English?
I do not know mine was in English. If their was something different my grandson would have said something
Can you play as a single. I want to play by myself.
Yes
Does this game work in the DSI XL?
We used it in a DSI and know nothing about the XL system. I would call game stop or Nintendo to get correct info, sorry I could not be of more help.

Yes! :)

compatible with vista 64bit? Can someone tell me if this will work with vista 64bit?
Yes it is. Here is the link for the drivers: http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/4/69446ACF-E625-4CCF-8F56-58B589934CD3/Xbox360_64Eng.exe
Games: What games work with this controller?
I don't have mine yet but from what I've read, most games will be compatible. Many newer games are even being made with this specific controller in mind so that helps.
Does is it work on 360
Yes it does. I actually can't distinguish it from the others so I wrote "PC" on the back of mine with sharpie so I wouldn't get them confused
Are these wired mouse controllers, genuine Microsoft controllers or knockoffs ?
They're the real deal, no worries.
2 xbox controller on 1 PC: Can 2 of these work together on one PC.
Yes, they will.
Programmable? Can you program the buttons for this controller?
Nope
Can you fit an HDMI cable under it? I have an A/V cable and when I try to plug an HDMI cord in it won't fit. So can you fit one under this cable?
HDMI cable will not fit under this monster cable
does this have the hdmi link to the xbox and component for the tv?
No, it isn't a HDMI cable. It has a bigger end which the older Xbox 360's (white ones) have.
will this work with the black xbox 360 the 2 gig hard drive im also useing a non hd tv
If you are using a TV with a component video input (Red, Blue, Green) then it will work but if it does not then it will not. This is a component only cable. I would recommend going with a cheaper composite option if your TV doesn't have a component video input.
help me!!!!!!!!!! way too confused on this hole thing so please make it simple for me. hd tv 1080p hooked up to the 360....for best game quality what it the best cable???
hdmi
Optical: Does this cable have an optical output?
This does not come with an optical output. You have to purchase the fiber optic cable made specifically for the X Box 360 which comes with the needed adapter in order for this cable to output Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.
can it play WOW with one arm!
Hi, you know it would take some practice but I think you could. Take a look at some of the cometing designs too, Belkin and Logitec spring to mind. Pick one that has mouse functionality on it, and with some experimentation and practice you should find it possible to return to WoW. Best of Luck, I hope it works out for you.
Can the dpad(#16) be assigned to control the mouse?
Yes
How do you guys assign Macros (toggle/hold) on this? I have a RAZER Orbweaver and the Macro can be toggled.
The macro assigning is done thru software that comes with the unit, or downloaded off saiteks site
Is it a analog stick or a 4/8 way hat. also do you know what type of keyboard switches do it use Mx, alps or membrane. thanks
It is an analog sick and the switches are membrane
does it have onboard memory? so i can program a macro, and take it to the ps4?
No. Also it is not compatible with home consoles. Windows only. I must note you that the Saitek Cyborg is much old and outdated now, discontinued by Saitek before PS4 time. I suggest you to look up on Razer Orbweaver Elite.
how would u rate this against the razer game pad ?
Against the older Razer gamepads based on the Nostromo design, this is a MUCH better game pad. It is very comfortable and responsive. The software is a little more difficult to use, but its easy enough if take your time and experiment with the setup. I cannot comment on the newer Razer Orbweaver/Tartarus, as I have not used them. However, they still look similar to the Nostromo designed pads.
will this work with the wii? will the nintendo wi-fi usb connector work with the nintendo wii?
according to nintendo's web site, it will work for the wii and ds. just check the shopnintendo site.
wifi: can you talk on your ds all around the world
only on Metroid prime: hunters so far. And only with your friends.
Does it work on Windows Vista? If I were to buy this product, would it work on a computer running Windows Vista?
No, from what I've heard it only works with XP. There are other usb connectors that will work with vista and 7 and macs, like the one from Planex.
Can this be used to connect to other comps? can this be used, when connected to my desktop, to allow internet access on my other computers as well as my Ds?
no
Do you have to have a connector to use Wi-Fi?
No. If you have a wireless connection, chances are you don't need anything else. I did, however, as I am using a free-wireless connection and don't have access to the main router. I just hooked the connector to my laptop and created a Nintendo-exclusive access point for both my DS and Wii.
whys it rated teen
No doubt because of the scare tactics. I wouldn't say it's scary, though it might be to someone who's younger than thirteen, really. Also, the backstory is a little morbid, when you go into looking through newspaper articles and whatnot in-game.
does this have the alternate ending
Probably not, since it doesnt say Extended Cut.
will the game play on newer os...windows 7?
Yes, I can play it on Windows 8 with all the latest patches. If I remember correctly, tho', you need the origin libraries/app installed as well, but I could be wrong about that.
Does it work on the xbox 360
No, this hasn't been ported to consoles yet. Also, I recommend buying Spore through Steam in case you get a faulty key like I did
Does it work on windows 8
Yes it does. I believe I had to go in as the administrator after installation and force it to run in Windows XP mode, but have had absolutely no problems running this game on Windows 8.
I got the game and it did'nt work and it did'nt even come out of the computor. This game got alot of reviews but it's really hard to install
We couldn't install the game. The product code provide with game didn't work. Waiting on refund now. I had to pay return postage.
Does it play on Windows 7?
Yes. Best to install it using origin.
Does it work on laptops windows 8
Yes it does, I run it in Windows 8 myself. It was designed to run on Windows XP and Vista so there may be the occasional crash, but I have had very few problems once I installed it as the administrator and forced it to run in the Windows XP format. Very fun game, hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
Do you need a constant online connection to play? Can I play in an offline mode when at a location with no internet?
Yes, you only need the internet to load the game. It may warn you that no internet connection is available, but it is not necessary once the game has been installed.
Will this play on Windows 8?
It does but I recommend purchasing it through origin.
will it run on a toshiba laptop with windows 8.1 ?
Yes I have played it before on there many times and works with all high settings.
Does it work on The second newest Mac?
I do not know - we have Windows 7. Sorry I couldn't help.
why does this say "no platform"? I had platinum then had to upgrade and does not work with new operating system.
My Printmaster Gold 17 would not work with Windows 8, so I am using it on another computer with Windows XP. I ordered Platinum for my Windows 8 computer and I am very unhappy with it. Most cards are without text.
Will this work with Windows 7?
I am using it with windows 7. So, Yes.
can I make calendars from this????
Yes you can and it's a fairly simple process. Instead, however, I would recommend going to this site and it is magnificent at creating calendars with various that you may want or need: http://www.calendarlabs.com/printable-calendar.php?template=tL1m A W Radle
Can I open my saved projects from Printmaster gold 16 with this?
Yes you can - it's rather simple. Open the PM program. A "desk top" type Print Master page will appear. There will be a series of icons across this page that do various things. In the lower right corner will be an icon for "Open My Projects" - click on that and it will open the folder with all of your saved projects.
Can this be run on the PC?
NO
What region is this game?
I don't think the game is region locked. If that's what you mean.
Can you play this on ps4?
No, its ps3 exclusive currently
Does this one include the trophys?
Yes
is multilanguage? Spanish?
yes
good afternoon, quisera know if you have the Spanish

For some reason my Wii console will not read this disk. We are on our second disk now and it hasn't read either one. Does any one know why this is?
The game's messed up. Something about how they made it that causes it to break after awhile. Went through like 3 already
My son is 5, will be this game easy to play for his age ?
yes he will learn to play super smash bros.brawel. I have a5 year old grand son that learn how to play all Mario's game. I also gave him a logo game and his now doing 10 years old logo game, and his only 5 years old. buy it for your son and you will find out how much a 5 year old kid knows. carlos nieves/
After playing about 3 games, the game seizes up and won't let you play anymore and you must shut the whole Wii off. Anyone else have this problem?
I've never had that problem with the game
i bought this game and a brand new xbox 360 4g......but the game screen keep freezing is the game faulty?
No it is not you just need to send it back and then get another one because it might have scarches on it so send it back get another one and see if it does the same thing and then hit me back

Cecilia I wish I could help,but this was a gift for our Grandson who lives in Tennesse and we live in Plattsburgh New York,I am not a gamer and he is on the go all the time ,so I don't hear from him.
Has any one had problems playing/installing GTA or is it just me?
No I haven't had any issues with it and I'm nearly 3/4 through the game. Does your disk have scratches/dirt? if so you may want to take a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol and thoroughly clean the disk.
how much gb is it if i want to install to hard drive
Im not sure I bought the actual game
THIS IS THE FULL GAME OR IS A DEMO ???
Full Game.

What do you mean the one below it?

No it is not!
Will this work on Windows 7?
It worked on my Windows 7 computer. I haven't tried it on 8.1 yet.
i had this mfs installed on my wind 8.1 and worked fine then when i had to delete everything and tried to reinstall it it wont reinstall anyideas how
It happened to me and I couldn't reinstall mine either I wish I knew how
I bought a "used" one and just realized it requires a product key. Will it work with with a product key that's been used before?
No product key is assigned to each software it will either not complete the installation or crash upon use sorry have tried with other products
Is this an expansion kit, or is the full FSX installation? This price on this way cheaper than the Gold and Standark packages I see for sale here on A
Full installation; but, this version is for use on XP machines ---&gt; doesn't work on modern Windoze boxes --- need version specific to -7 or -8 and/or -64 bit, if using those machines. Install this version on newer machines and computer will respond with, "Are you talking to me?"
How can i run it on a mac?, thank you in advanced!
I don't know, I run the program with windows
does fsx work on windows 8.1
Yes
Does this game comes as a CD or DVD ? Are there any other appliances that must be used i.e joystick?
my copy was a cd and would not work with windows 7, it helps if you use some kind of joystick as you can get behind the helicopter using a keyboard, hope that helps
Does it work on Mac?
I have heard that some Mac's can run Windows. So, unless your Mac is running Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8, I would have to say no.
I have a windows 8.1. Tell me if these spec would work. 3.6GHz HP Xeon 800MHz 2MB L2 Cache Socket 604pin 370461602 CPU A 4 GB RAM and a defauly video card (people say fsx dosent rely on the graphics mostly cpu)
Should run fine, graphics may be a little "off", as in detail/resolution. Would recommend a check with MS's website to see if any "patches" are required for Win 8.1.
Does this crash on windows 7 like the gold one does???Is it a good have good graphits???......NEED HELP!!!!!!!!!!!1
I've never had the program crash, in win 7. The graphics are improved is some areas but still have along way to go. The instruments are harder to read than they were in ver. 2002

Does it work with Playseats?
Yes, it works PERFECTLY with the Playseat Evolution. (Not sure about earlier generation Playseats.) The Evo has pre-drilled holes that line up with the bottom of your G25 wheel platform and your G25 pedal platform, though you will have to offset the Evo pedal panel quite a bit to where it's strange looking but not impractical from a functional standpoint. Look into buying the additional Playseat Evo attachment for the G25 shifter. I don't think Amazon sells it ... I ended up getting that attachment from MaxWho.com.
Is it only compatible with ps3? Is it compatible with xbox 360? my son is planning to us with pc windows version 8.1 and farming simulator.
Unfortunately the Logitech G25 is only compatible with PC and the PS3. From what I know there is no XBOX support from any Logitech racing wheels.
Is this gaming wheel compatible with windows 8.1?
Yes
Is it compatible with Windows 7 ?
Yes
what games does this product work with
I've only used it with grand torismo, but I'm sure it will work with all driving games. Only compatible with Play Station.
g25 on the 360: Hey i was just wondering if the G25 is compatible with the xbox 360?
G25/G27 is not compatible with the Xbox 360. You're somewhat limited in selection of wheels for the 360, but I'd recommend a Fanatec wheel. Preferably the multiplatform 911 Turbo S (clutch/H-shifter), but check their site out for yourself and see: www.fanatec.com Microsoft's wheel is decent to start out with, but if you're playing Forza 3 I'm sure you'll eventually want more. Also, there was an excellent wheel shootout at www.insidesimracing.tv I know you asked the beginning of Dec, but on chance you haven't made up your mind I hope it helps. Good luck.
G25 and Which Driving Games? What driving games will this hardware work with?
gtr is good but if you play online get rfactor ps try some demos
Clutch/Brake actuation - real simulator OR push a button gameplay: So here are my questions; (1) Is the clutch and brake more like an acrade video game or an actual driving simulator?
I have been wondering this exact same thing for a while now. Of course I already have the wheel, lol, so doesn't matter. Really need to start getting it set up since the game comes out in about a 10 days.
Dirt for PS3 &amp; compatable Racing Wheels: any advise?
It's a catch 22. Any PS2/PS3 wheel will work for Dirt, but you won't want to use it. There is significant steering lag with Dirt. Which means your going straight and your car is still turning, it makes for a very frustrating experience. Can't speak for how it runs on the 360 but on the PC it'll run good if you have a very powerful PC. Your best bet is to stick with a controller if you only have the PS3 version.
G25 Wheel: Will this wheel work on Midnight Club Los Angeles?
yes, on ps3
do you need to solder anything?
Nope.. It's all pre wired. Just open the case on your console. Then unplug the old Stock Xbox fan. After that replace it with the talismoon fan. Now then your going to want to test the fan by turning on your Xbox and make sure it works. If it works correctly you can now put the console back together. and... TADAAA! You've successfully installed your new fan. Hope this helps! :) (I'm 12)
Does this fan have a four pin connection?
Yes, it has the 4 pin connection for the old xenon motherboards.
Does it work with the xbox 360 E?
Not that I'm aware of you better off with the stock fans and if they are bad just get new versions ...my whisper fans started getting bearing scream so just go with stock ones !!!&#128512;
Does this work with the XBOX 360 core? And does it actually improve performance?
Yes, it works with the older xbox core system. It does increase air flow and it looks neat in the process. Its not going to stop a rrod system from red ringing but it should help a system to not get it in the first place.
Am i suppose to recieve a spliter for the fan? Because as of now, the male is 3 prong and the female is 4.
It's been over a year since I installed this on my elite. What little I remember is that everything matched up fine. Maybe different versions have different fan plugs? Hopefully someone here has opened up several original model 360s to verify this.
Does it work with the xbox 360E
no fan is in a diff spot and it is smaller on 360E...srry
Does this work on the xbox 360 slim?
No this is for the original "fat" system
Has anyone used these with Star Citizen/Arena Commander?
Yes, it works. You may need to load a custom XML using the console.
i want to know real weight (without case).Thank`s
my scale said 5.4 lbs.
Do the Rudder pedals control nose wheel steering?
Not only do the control NWS, they can also control differential braking
Is this product the standard Saitek Pro or the Combat version? Confusing because first photo is the combat version (metal pedals) and rest standard.
IDK either ... I bought it and got the standard version. I do not see much difference except for the metal on the pedals which maybe makes them more durable. I use the pedals with Windows XP as my OS; the interface of my pedals is USB, the Saitek Drivers get the pedals into my computer and Saitek includes a program to check that the pedals are working. BUT to get the pedal info into any running program they have to be linked to the Windows Device Manager by going to the Control Panel and Clicking on Game Controllers, then clicking on ADD then scroll down to Saitek and select it. I made a screen shot but Amazon does not give me a way to attach it to this e-mail.
Will the Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals work with Windows 8?
Yes, but if you're trying to use FSX you're going to have problems.
where can I find list of supported games? and does it support Elite: Dangerous?
We don't know of any list but he uses this specifically for Elite Dangerous. He says the rudder pedals can be programmed to any game just like a joystick.
what is the warrenty?
Not sure what the warranty is on this but I have had no issues with it so far. Amazon is great about backing up the products they sell and allowing returns if needed.
Do the pedals work properly if I plug them in the Saitek Pro Yoke instead of my PC? I have a shortage of USB ports in my PC.
Yes that's how I have them hooked up
Is this device HID compliant? Or does it rely on the included setup software for assigning controls?
They don't mention HID compliant on the box or in the instructions, but it comes with driver software and you can personalize your setup.
Does this work with Prepar3d 1.x?
Yes
Dose this work for other game systems? Dose this work for other game systems?
If your system has an optical cable, such as the PS 3, all you have to do is unplug the optical cord from the subwoofer and plug that into the same port on your other system.
Help needed for HD newbie with 360! I'm considering buying that Pioneer HTS-GS1 5.1-Channel Surround Sound System for the Xbox 360, but am I to understand that I need a receiver or something?
Should be.Just use the optical ports from the Pioneer plug it in using the provided toslink cable to the Xbox 360 HD Cable. There is no need to have your Red and White audio jack in the TV. The Xbox 360 will effectively bypass sending audio to the TV and will send the digital audio signal directly to the Pioneer. Then have fun. But if you want your TV to have surround sound make sure it is connected (Audio out) to the Pioneer.
Anyone know how can i connect my Iphone to this Sound system? just for playing music? anyone know what wires i need and setup?
Just connect a 3.5mm to RCA cable to the back of the woofer (receiver) and set the input to analog.
is this connected to XBox, or TV ?
i have them both hooked up
Can I buy the remote off of you?
No, I only have one
what the total power of subwoofer and it RMS ?
Subwoofer: 100W x 1 (RMS 10% THD@100Hz)
Remote won't control any Xbox function. Does yours? So the question is does your remote operate all the Xbox functions?
mine works just fine. Be advised that all xbox control go through the IR port on the xbox itself (not the pioneer receiver). Make sure that you have a direct line between this port and the remote and try wiping the IR port on the 360 as it have have collected too much dust. The other option is that the IR port on your 360 simply is defective. I doubt it would be the remote or anything with the pioneer system since it performs it independent functions.
Pioneer for Xbox 360 - Is it HDMI compatible? Does anyone know if the system is HDMI compatible?
This system (as far as I could read) has only Audio inputs. HDMI is an audio and video cable. If you are trying to connect this to an HDTV that has an HDMI input, then chances are that it has Digital Audio output too. Simply hook this digital output to the sound system. there will be some finer tweaks you need to workout with the tv such as whether the tv volume controlls the output volume and if the TVs speakers should then be turned off. For more personallized help, most High school to college aged boys/men, and an increasing number of women, have the knowlege required to get it working at a livable level. usually a trip to a Best Buy with a list of the items you have including brand and model number can prove very helpfull too.
Compatible with original XBOX? but can anyone tell me for sure if this Pioneer HTS-GS1 600W 5.1 CH FOR XBOX is compatible with xbox, but not the 360?
This unit as far as I have read has a conventional RCA Plug style red and white stereo input that would work with an original Xbox flawlessly if you use the supplied Composite A/V cable for the xbox. As far as getting 5.1 surround sound from that connection I am unsure. I am sure that there is an adapter somewhere that plugs into the xbox and outputs a digital sound signal of either optical or coaxial types.
Standard Speakers? The question remains: Are these standard speakers that can be used with any receiver/amp, or do they have proprietary connectors that can only be used with the included unit?
this cannot be used with any other receiver/amp, as it has a built in amp inside the subwoofer.
Does it work with Xbox One controller ?
No.
Does this work on Windows 8?
Indeed it does, without any issues or driver installs. Works right out of the box.
does it work with steam?
Yep. Works with games that use controllers like skyrim
how many controllers work at a time
You can sync up to four to the computer just like the 360, each controller will also have difference light position light up. I've tried up to 3, only have 3 controllers. Source can also be found here, first paragraph. http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/connections/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows
does it work with Ubuntu
I use mine regularly in Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit. It was plug and play.
I know it's compatible for Windows, but does it also work for Macbook Pros?
Yes, in fact I myself have used it on my Macbook. I used this guide to set it up: http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_use_xbox_360_wireless_controller_your_mac Happy Gaming :)
Does it work with raspberry pi, specifically RetroPi?
I'm testing it out right now, it was recognized after a reboot in emulationstation. The usb was just recognized after installing the driver from retropie_setup.sh. This is on RetroPie 2.4.2
does it work for minecraft?
Minecraft for PC never came with a gamepad option, you'll need to use a program called JoyPad to play MC... But that goes for any gamepad not just this.
Does this work with the new Xbox One controller?
No. But there are drivers available for the Xbox one controller so that you can use it with a USB cable. http://majornelson.com/2014/06/05/pc-drivers-for-the-xbox-one-controller-available-now/
Is this compatable with windows 7 ?
Yes. I run Windows 7 ultimate 64bit and it works just fine.
Will this work on iMac Maverick OS?
Works great for me and I have the most recent update for mac
does this game include war of chifes and asian dynasties?
No sorry you need to buy those expansions seperately
Dose it work on MacBook Air?
It should! Check the system requirements to be sure. It does need a disc drive though so you'll need to get an external one if you don't have one already.
Is this item compatible with Mac OS X 10.9 Maverick?
yes
Is this a download version or disc? i only have a usb port no dvd reader on my mac
It is a disc.
Would this game work on my 2013 Macbook Air with base specs (1.3 ghz Haswell, 4gb ram)?
yes, it should!
Is this the starting pack that you have to buy in order to add on the expansion packs, such as AOE Asian Dynasties?
Yes, this is the base pack for AEIII. Once loaded you can add War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties. It's a fun game.
Is this really 199 dollars? And the expansion packs are 5? Really?
Alan, i can't really answer your question. The copy of this game that i have for sale is $150.00. The reason it is priced at $150.00 is that based on the other copies available at the time I listed it $150.00 seemed like a fair price based on what other seller were asking for their copies. Beyond that, I'm at a loss. I don't play video games and don't really know what an Expansion Pack involves and so I've no idea why they only cost $5.00. Perhaps there is less to them than the game itself.
Does this come with a charger?
Yes, but always ask the seller to confirm this.
Does this feature a gba compatable link cable port?
I don't think so, I believe you have to buy an adapter for it.
Can the ds lite play any ds game (excluding ones for later models)?
Yes but not ds2 or later games
i do have Games for the nintendo ds lite from germany , can i use theese with a US Nintendo ds lite?
Yes, you can play DS games from Germany on a US Nintento DS and vice versa because the Nintendo DS is region free so you can play any games from any region on your console. You can set the language when you set up your DS.
What types of games can you play on this?
Ds games and games boy advance sp games. The ds games go on top in the back the small slot and the Gameboy advance games go on the bottom.

Do it work on the psgo system.
I bought this little camera about a year ago and it look cheap but by accident washed twice and still working. The Instructions come in Chinese but I didn't need them lol. So yes it works !!
Does this camera work with the PS Vita?
Not that i know of....

Compatible models are "PSP-1000 Series / PSP-2000 Series / PSP-3000 series". this is written in SONY's official website.
Can this camera work on skype for my psp 3000?
in a word, Yes.
!! can this thing really record videos???
Yes
How does this stand up to jumping? I tend to be a jumper when I'm playing, and i was wondering if this is going to slip?
If you have tile or hardwood floors it doesn't slip! It kind of has a non slip grip at the bottom to help.
delayed
No
delayed
If your asking does it have a reaction delay, we have never noticed one. Excellent DDR pad. It gets ton of use at my house. No complaints yet

Absolutely!
Are these 100% Authentic and Brand New sealed???
They appear to be but then I can't get mine to play in color on my HD TV, so I'm not 100% certain.

The ones we bought were bought used a few years ago and all cables required to play were included. The PS2 system is no longer made and good quality used units are harder to find now. Good luck!

Is this compatible with windows 8?!
Yes. My friend played it on windows 8. If any problems arise, you can always right click the game and go to "properties" and find the ability to run the game as an ealier edition of windows. Also, check out aoe2 hd. You might prefer it. Good luck.
Has anyone been able to use this disk with Windows 7? It works for a while then works partially until it needs to start a game
usually works fine on my Windows 7 system. It does fail sometimes due to DirectDraw error.
Does it also runs on windows 7 ?
Not very well, go for the new HD release on Steam.
Can you play 2 player (LAN) with 1 DVD or does each player need a DVD?
You can install the game on an unlimited number of computers and LAN with buddies without needing the disc in any of the computers!
Will this play with a 2D video card and Windows 7?
I have windows 7 but not sure what kind of video card I have. The game works fine for me.
Do any of the Age of Empires III have the Alamo battle? Thank you.
sorry not that I know of
Can you play with other computers? We tried one w/ this version &amp; another w/ the conquerers CD and it didn't work?
I will not try yet, but that could not be it, I think so, you must need it than both computers have the same version to could play!
will it run on a mac
NO.
can it run on windows 7 or 8.1
Yes Windows 7, but it is full screen, no window. F3 can pause the game, but you have to get the volume level right before you start because you can't adjust it during the game.
Can I download it to my pc from Amazon?
I don't believe it comes in a download form. Mine came in a disc pack. It also plays without a play-disc so it can be loaded on all of your computers.
Playseat sale anytime soon? Is there any chance the Playseat classic or evolution is going to go on sale anytime soon?
It would be nice if there were another sale here soon. After all, Race Pro is coming out for the 360 next week, and it caters to a simulator crowd (who tend to spend money on things like this). I'm in this category, and frankly, the first company to put the Evolution on a good sale will get my money. I'd like it to be Amazon, but if it is someone else, so be it.
On Sale: Does anyone think they when this playseat will go on sale again?
There's a $50 off code good until mid-May, UKM8Y7AH
What is with the fluctuating price? Why the volatile price?
It seems strange to me too, every time I look at this chair it is a different price. I found plans to build one with a more solid frame, that you can use a regular car seat from a junk yard, for $80 in parts if you have a welder. I may try that before buying this chair with its high markup in price.
does it come with g 27 gear shift holder
It has the plate you see in the picture of it and you screw the steering wheel down onto it as tight as you can get. The wheel I have has the shifter as part of the overall assembly. The wheel pedal kit I bought is a M/N E-X5C 19 model number that has the shifter and wheel as one plastic assembly. I went to Logitech and the picture they show for the G27 is a totally separate shifter and there is no way to mount it on what I have. There may be an adapter you can buy but I don't know. Good luck and enjoy. I really like the seat. It is so comfortable when you get tired yo can just nap right in it. :-)
Playseat boxed weight and size: Could anyone tell me what the weight and size of the boxed seat is as it arrives from Amazon?
Hey Ritchie, did you ever find out? I was planning to do the same thing (check it on a flight). Thanks Raph
I'm 5'3 with short legs, will this be a problem?
No its adjustable enjoy!
Do you have to use two feet to gas/brake because there's a post going down the middle?
Yes you do have to use both feet with this game seat because of the post that holds the base where you attach the wheel. I wouldn't let that bother you that much unless you are trying to get serious for real life racing there they use the toe/heel for gas and brake. I can tell you that I really like the seat even though I don't use it that often. I recently built a platform to mount it on and put small caster wheels on the bottom of it so I can easily move it around the room. I also ended up making a stop at the top of the pedals as they didn't want to stay in place as good as I would have liked. If I needed to buy another one this would be my choice. Good luck and I hope you enjoy it.
hello everyone. i have this playseat more than 3 years. My question is if i can use a new Thrustmaster Ferrari F1 Wheel Integral 500 on it.
Should work as long as the Thrustmaster wheel has a table (flat surface) type clamp as do most wheels
Flight Sim Seat Possibility? Is it possible to get a pair of the Playseats Gearshift Holder Mounts to put on both sides of the playseat and have a flight sim cockpit?
This is exactly what I did, but you'll need to modify them slightly. I got two gear shift holders, the base on the gear shift holders is too small for a flight stick / throttle to sit on so what I did was cut some particle board, drilled holes in it so I can mount it on top of the gear shift holders, laid some black leather (from hobby lobby) across the wood (to make it match seat) and then put some plexiglass pieces on top of it so my throttle/stick suction cups have something to stick onto. Overall it works GREAT. Used it to for Ace Combat 6, Hawxx, and many other PC flight sims.
Steering Wheel Bar: Can you right foot brake and do heel and toe like reality or does the steering wheel bar enable you from doing so.
You can, no problems right foot braking.

Xbox 360 Controller: Windows vs. Xbox: Here's the question: if it's wireless, will it work on an Xbox 360 without the receiver (just like a regular Xbox 360 wireless controller) or does it need the receiver as well just to connect to an Xbox 360???
It's the exact same controller included with and sold for the xbox 360. The included receiver is only needed for Windows.
Does this product include wireless receiver? I think yes. but then why amazon suggests to buy this controller with wireless receiver altogether in 'Frequently Bought Together' section?
Yes it does. You do not have to purchase a separate receiver.
Does it bring the receiver to use with de pc?
No
Will this receiver work with all of the controllers or just the one it comes with? Will this receiver work with all of the XBOX 360 controllers or just the one it comes with?
It will work with any xbox 360 wireless controller and up to 4 controllers can be connected at a time.
Does it support or work on windows7?? I have a doubt that whether or not it can work on windows 7???
yeah, i installed the disc and it works fine
Does this work on a mac? Just wondering if this works with the mac or if there are existing drivers to have it work on both the pc bootcamp partition as well as mac games?
One of the reviews claimed that there were unofficial Mac drivers that worked well. But I don't know from personal experience. Your best bet would probably be to Google it.
Xbox 360 wireless controllers - difference in models? Anyone know what the difference in products is, since there's an $8 difference in price?
The 49.99 version comes with a usb reciever you can plug into your computer. The cheaper one cannot be used on your pc unless you buy the reciever sepratley.
Can this game be played with Window 8?
I played on windows 8 and it seemed to handle it alright, but I think I had to change some computer settings.
Just to clarify, this IS just a cd-rom game, right? You just pop it in the drive and play?
Yes, its a Cd-Rom game.. and it's a really fun/spooky point and click :-)
Are all the games multi hands???
No. You have a choice of single play, or 3,4,5,10,15,25,50 and 100 play.
can we change the pay table
Cannot answer your question. Did not care for this and threw it away shortly after getting it. Bought WinPoker through Amazon instead which we are very happy with.
Can the cd be installed on a pc and a laptop at the same time/
I don't know. It stopped working on my PC, so I uninstalled it. When I tried to remove the disk from its holder in the case, it was so hard to remove that I cracked it in the center about half inch. I tried to reload it into my PC several times, but nothing ever happened. However, I would think that the disk could be downloaded to as many computers as you wished. Francine
Will this cd run on Windows 8?
Right now I have windows 7 so I dont know. you can go to the website and ask the source. He answered my emails and even updated my software when improvements were made.
Is there preset button mapping for Elite Dangerous available? Has anyone used this particular HOTAS in Elite Dangerous, and how well does it function?
Elite Dangerous is the main reason I bought the x52 pro, Elite does have a config for the x52 pro however it is missing the one or two different buttons. They are easy enough to config and If you want to use the "clutch button" "I" you will need to disable clutch mode in the x52 control panel. The x52 pro it self is amazing for Elite Dangerous, I have had mine for a few months now and haven't had any problems. The HOTAS used in the cockpits are almost exactly the same as this one so if you are using an oculus rift it is quiet immersive. http://youtu.be/JOoiEhOBcT8 for a review on this product that I did awhile back.
Is the base heavy enough to play with it resting on a desk, or does it need to be bolted down?
The answer is that it needs to be secured some way--especially the throttle. I went to Walmart and bought the sticky-back strip Velcro they have, stuck 2 strips of the pile side on my bench, and two matching strips of the hook part onto the throttle base and it works well. I don't secure the stick because it's heavier--occasionally if I get "ham-fisted" it lifts up slightly, but I just sit it back down and it's OK. Now if you have a very smooth desktop for the throttle, maybe the suction cups supplied with the throttle will hold it down, but my surface is unfinished wood, so the suction cups are not effective.
Is this available for windows 7 ???
Yes, works with xp, vista, 7 and 8 - may have to download the proper version from their website, http://saitek.com/
Does the throttle work on it's own, since I'll be using a different stick? Thanks in advance.
Yes! Actually the main piece is the throttle part. The stick is cabled to the throttle using a Saitek proprietary cable so you will be ok if using a different stick and have this one as a backup. Another tip: don't use the throttle in a raw wood, if you do this the throttle will hot hold the position when you will use it. Nothing that can avoid the use but using it in a glass or solid table is the must considering you can use the 'suckers' (haha I don't know the name in english).
Can I twist the stick to control yaw in a helicopter or use it as rudder in a plane?
Yeah, the sick has twist for yaw/rudder control. Even has a twist lock if you plan to use it with rudder pedals. I would recommend that you mag mod the stick though as the stock sensitivity isn't all that great. It's a simple mod, and makes a world of difference (YouTube for tutorials) if you sent scared to fiddle with the stick innards.
what are the box dimmensions?
Was like 22 x 12 x 9 something like that. Not massive. But not,tiny by any,means
contents of box
stick, throttle, cable between the two, USB cable to computer, CD, and a quick start pamphlet--make sure you read ALL the reviews--this system can be tricky to get working, depending upon your system
Does this still require the magnet mod to fine tune the stick?
No
How easy are the Profiles on the X52 Pro to program in the software?
It's pretty intuitive, and there are tutorials on line. Be sure to use the software from the website though, and not the CD version that comes with the stick.
Can the buttons be reprogrammed like the X55?
Yes, any button can be programed
good for project m ?
Perfect For Project M , I Got This Very SD Card Just For It And Works Fine
Do I have to have this to download games?
No but it can be used to store more games than on the Wii hard drive.
Is this a SDHC memory card?
No. Definitely not. Regular SD. Not SDHC
What is bulk packaging?
Mine came in that hard-to-open, melted-together, too-big-for-the-product plastic packaging.
What does "Bulk Packaging" means? Why is it cheaper?
Nothing at all. You are not paying for all the non-recyclable plastic waste for individual unit packaging.
Mac OS X? Anyone know if this thing works at all on a Mac?
This mouse DOES entirely work on OS X. They sell a white lit version labeled as the OS X version but all Death Adder mice are the exact same no matter what color they are. The only difference is you'll have to download the OSX driver from the website because there are only PC drivers on the disk.
is this grey or black? because i see a lot of mixed in the customer pictures..
black. It's probably the flash on cameras that make it look grey. It's the color of the mouse itself you need to watch out for. Or you'll end up with non matching glows.
notebook: Is it compatable with laptops?
Yes it is, because I am using it for my laptop.
Anyone compared it to a copperhead? Is this a better mouse than the copperhaad?
I haven't got to compare them, but the Copperhead in terms of performance is definitely better, but a lot of (right handed people) people might prefer the Death Adder because of the right-handed design. I own a Copperhead, it is the mouse to slay all other mice in terms of sheer performance, so slacking a little on performance really isn't that big of a deal. If I wasn't a lefty I'd probably prefer the Death Adder.
Will this work with Windows 8.1 ?
Yes! I use it on 8.1! Works fine download joytokey if you don't know what to do!
I know this is meant for a computer, but would it also work with the Wii U possibly?
No it wouldn't. You would have to get an official Gamecube to Wii U adapter
does this work with Mac OS X too?
Yes just plug and play
I have a macbook and heard this would work on a mac...it has a mini disk. does not work. is there a driver i can install/donwload?
yes. my computer actually auto-downloaded the drivers(windows, sorry). google 3 in 1 magic joy box drivers and you should get there.
Has anyone experience input delays with this adapter?
None at all
Will this work with the GameCube Logitech force feedback wheel? I don't care about the force feedback functionality, just working with wheel and pedal
i have NO IDEA, i would like to ask what makes everyone think i have all the answers, i as ONE question in the past and i get asked questions, in what world does that make ANY sense...
does it support multiplayer?
I'm going to assume you mean can multiple people use this at once. No, you cannot.
Is it compatible with other emulators? For example, If I wanted to play a SNES emulator with a PS2 controller, would it work?
Yes, it does work, it doesn't care what controller you're using, you just set up the controls through your emulator and play. No special configuring.
Does this controller allow 2 players to use gamecube or ps2 controller at the same time?
It does allow for multiple controllers at the same time. Its worked for me with GCB and a ps1 ckbtroller . but I assume ps2 and Xbox would work too
does it work with mac?
Yes. I bought it to use with a Mac and a GameCube controller and it worked as soon as I plugged it in. I was using it to play Dusy: An Elusian Tail, which is designed for an Xbox controller so the button mapping was off but I think that's a consequence of the game.
will this work on win 7 64 machine?
I was not able to get it working on Windows 7. I had to install a virtual machine running Windows 95 in order to play.
will this run on win XP?
Although Timelapse was originally designed for Windows 3.1 or Windows 95; with regard to WindowsXP, it runs best (without lockups or crashes) when the "Compatibility Mode" is set to WindowsNT 4.0 with Service Pack 5.
will it run on win7?
I don't think so. And I haven't found a patch for it yet.

Would it work for a Guitar Hero 2 controller for the PS3 Guitar Hero and Rock Band games?
Yes and No. PS2 controllers and peripherals will only work on PS2 software/games. That is if the PS2 software is compatible with the PS3. I have not found any PS2 accessories that will work for PS3 software/games. There is backwards compatibility. PS3 controllers will work for PS2 games. With the exception of the PS3 Move Controllers, most PS3 controllers will operate most PS2 software.
I am trying to get this joystick at http://amzn.to/UkGz6n to work with my orginal XBox (XBox before XBox 360 and One). Will this adapter work?
I highly doubt it. The connector is PS specific.
Does it work for xbox 360 slim?
No this will not work on X-box
does this adapter work with the newer ps3 slims?
Yes it does it works on every ps3
Does this work for dance pads as well? I have a Red Octane Afterburner I would love to use on my PS3.
I don't know with dance pads. I only used a wireless EA Sports PS2 controller with this and it worked flawlessly. I don't have a dance pad to try for you. Sorry.
I know it says PS2 to PS3, but it's a USB, do you think it'll work if i plugged it into my Xbox 360?
Didn't work for my PS2 to PS3 so I doubt it.
will this work with my ps2 dance mats on a newer ps3 slim
is 2014 if you are still looking to use ps2 gear for ps3 .........it does work i dont know about guitar hero but fifa 2012 worked fine...
Can this be used to connect a PS2 controller to a PC?
Definitely! In fact, that's why I bought it, so I could game on my PC with a PS2 emulator.
If using this for a PC will it recognize the analog sticks?
Yes, but please note that controller may not be compatible with all PS3 games.
Will this work with a PS2 Hori fight stick? Since there is no analog button on the stick how would it register when asked for the PS button?
I didn't see if the analog button was mapped as ps3 button. However it might be since ps3 uses analog all the time. I was using my PS3 Blu Ray remote to go to PS3 menu
This game does come with the manual and code, correct? I just want to be sure because most games sold forget to include the manuals.
Yes. It came with everything.
Does this game work on Macs?
Not if you buy the PC version. It needs to be the MAC version to run on a MAC. You can tell which version it is by looking on the upper left hand side of the cover.
how do u get these games to work on windows 7 ...
you must first turn off any virus protection, then you download using the autorun that should work
Does this game (UK version) work on the American (USA) windows 7 laptop?
Yes. I have Windows 7 (American) and this deluxe is compatible. Hope I helped!
I have the sims 2 expansion packs but I need the double deluxe or will the sims 2 work with it by its self and the expansion packs?
Well, the Sims 2 is the same thing as Double Deluxe, just without the expansion packs. So, no, you don't need the double deluxe if you have the Sims 2 base game.
Will this game work with the new Windows 8 computer?
It didn't work on my windows 8. So I don't think so.
does this work on windows 8.1
It worked on my windows 8 laptop, so it may work on windows 8.1
Will it work with windows 8?
Yes
Here is a strange question. Can Sims in sims 2 be polygamist? I discovered in Sims 1 they can. In fact my Sim has three wives under one roof .
Yes
Did you have any problems with the downloads?My old CD would stop downloading and will tell me to retry again because a specific file will this happen
I never downloaded anything, but I guess you could retry it. If that doesn't work, re-install the game, or call customer support.
I can not tell from you image does this take the Wii to HDMI??
No just component, red, green, blue, then white and another red for audio. NO HDMI
Does anyone know if this will connect a GameCube to an HDTV?
No, this is not compatible with the Gamecube. However, you can play Gamecube games in progressive scan using this cable on a Wii.
I have a Wii that I need to connect to my Vizio E550i-B2. If I buy this cable, where do I insert the video portion? I also have HD cables connected.
I looked up your television model you only have one slot for component cables just plug in the matching colors red to red white to white green to green blue to blue etc. Cables work great. Make sure to change wii settings to 480p under settings
Can this be used on the wii or the wii u?
Not sure about the wii u. I used it on my wii
Do these actually support 1080i? From what I know the wii only supports 480p, unless they are talking about the wii u.
No.
Can use this from my laptop, to my tvs rca connection,because all the hdmi ports on my tv are being used...Thanks before hand.
I'm not sure. My son ordered it, & he's not available to ask. Wish I could be of more help!
How to decrease brightnes?It appears too bright can't see menu buttons.
That is something that would most likely be in your TV's menu. Try finding the menu button on your TV remote, then find the picture setting. There should be an option to decrease brightness in there.
Will this work with a wii mini to 1080p HD TV?
The Wii Mini only supports the regular composite cables (red, white, and yellow) unfortunately.
does this work with Nintendo 64?
No it does not
How to fix a zoomed in wii screen which only appears on amazon instant video using this cable?
Adjust your TVs zoom settings. If your TV lacks those, adjust the Wii's over scan settings. If THAT doesn't work, get a better TV.
Does this game come with the DLC?
No, at least mycopy didn't come with it. You have to buy it off the XBOX Live Marketplace.
Does this come withthe bonus content disk?
It depends on which version you order now. As of today, they release the trilogy all together now where some of the bonus content is included. Before purchasing, I'd do more research to make sure. This one I ordered did not though. Find the trilogy where it's all of them together and you may be able to find the package where each game has its bonus content included! :-)
Should i buy 3 games separately or with trilogy. People say trilogy doesn't have dlc. Does these separate games come with the DLCS on amazon?
For X360: Actually, the trilogy box set only has one DLC (for the first Mass Effect) that actually costs around $1-$5 by itself. With Mass Effect 2, there's the Cerberus Pass (which was once only available with a new purchase, but can now be downloaded from the Xbox Live Marketplace) and half of the DLC is free (go to Xbox Marketplace, find Mass Effect 2 DLC, and download Cerberus Network which is free, and you can download DLC from it which includes a new character, weapons armies and extra missions). Mass Effect 3 DOES need an Online Pass for online play, but some people were able to bypass this by having Xbox Live. Unfortunately, in both the trilogy and by itself, Mass Effect 3 contains NO DLC at all. The only free DLC is downloaded from Xbox Live Marketplace (it's add-ons for multiplayer, extra places to fight and more choices of bad guys to fight against). Every other DLC is not free. It doesn't actually matter which one you buy, as the only difference is the Bring Down the Sky DLC. Overall, the trilogy has only one DLC that isn't quite expensive while separately there are none. But if price matters, buy all three separately, as it can be cheaper sometimes by finding the right sellers. This may be kind of confusing but I hope I helped.
Since it's used can it be installed and play by someone else?
Yes it can.
Where on the DVD is the product key.I tried entering and it still wont take it
I got a case with mine that had a paper on the tiger woods golf inside and on the back of that paper is thecode number...I hope this helps let me know
Is it compatible with Apple iMac?
Tiger woods pga tour 08 only works with windows xp and windows vista. You should find out about a newer version in www.easport.com that applies to Apple. Sorry for delayed answer but I was traveling in the northern part of my country which is Argentina, South America
Will this work with Windows 8.1 64 bit?
I don't know for sure - I was using windows 7., 64 bit and it seemed to work ok. There were some bugs and hang ups but it eventually worked ok
is this compatible with windows 7 64 bit
Yes it will play on Win7 x64, I do daily.
Does it play on Windows 8.1?
yes- it plays on win 8.1 - but depending on your video card- for some reason there are some ati cards that cannot run tw8- if you have Nvidia you should have no problems. also look for the mod that allows you to run the game 1920x1080 if you have wide screen monitor, search for 'Universal Widescreen Patcher' its a simple utility and it works. also goto course source . com for hundreds and hundreds of user made courses- better than the ones that came with game.
Will this arrive in an original Microsoft Xbox package or wrapped up in bubble wrap? Also what is the mAh rating on the battery?
it will arrive in the official Microsoft Xbox package
How many charge-and-play kits can be plugged in at the same time to the Xbox 360 250gb console?
3. two front, 1 rear of original design (white or black). 4. two front, two rear of Slim. Using rear ports loses at least 15" of distance from haveing to wrap around the rear of the xbox and up a side.
Will this let me use a wireless controller through USB on a PC or laptop, without using the Microsoft gaming receiver?
Nope you can't. I tried doing this but the receiver had to be connected.
How long is the cord?
According to the pckaging it's a 9 foot cord.
Will this work with PC?
It will charge through PC. In order to use the actual controller through the PC, you need the Microsoft adapter. I bought this item and the adapter; works great. Still cheaper than buying a wired usb controller, although those are good too.
Can the cable be used by itself to play on xbox? Or say the cable plus an empty battery compartment?
Yes. It basically turns your controller into a wired controller without the battery pack. But you can also put in the rechargeable battery pack and charge it to play wirelessly.
Is the included battery just a standard rechargeable battery that I can use with the MS dual recharging station?
Yes, it's a standard microsoft battery, works great with any microsoft charge kits like the duel black MS charge station.
Is it a battery? What's is the mAH?
It's a battery and a charger, so it's a great value. Sorry, but I don't know the mAh. I'd look at other reviews for more detail
It's hard to tell, could you plug this into a USB port on a PC or only to the XBox?
both. the idea is that this would normally be used for a PC.
Will this work with the wireless version for windows?
It sure will. If you already own an Xbox 360 and the 360 controller (as it should have come with) then the cord will act as a charger and you'll also have an extra battery pack.
Does the Greatest Hits edition have trophies?
I got my husband, who is the owner of the game to help me with the answer. Unfortunately NO, that particular game does not have trophies. A particular good way that you can determine even before you purchase your game is to look very closely on the back cover of your games hard case. In the very top portion of the paper label (top Rh corner) opposite the Playstation Network name it will say (ADD ON CONTENT) and underneath both languages stating that will say (TROPHIES) that DOES NOT appear on your game in question. It IS on his AC II greatest hits, AC III, and also his RELEVATIONS. We hope that this has helped you. Remember to look on the back top right of your cover sleeve, that's where they print that sort of info.
what is the order of the assassin's creed games.

So there you go.. hope this helps
Does this edition of the game have subtitles? I bought the first one when it first came out, and it did not, so was difficult for hard of hearing.
No
I bought AC2. My friend now says I "Have" to play 1 to get the entire storyline understood? Without spoiling it, should I really start from the first?
It depends on you.I think it's not necessary you have to play AC1 if you only play AC2.But if you play the Ezio trilogy you'd better paly the AC1
this in Spanish
no the game is in english
This game has subtitles in Spanish?
Assassins Creed 1 does not have subtitles.

This came used from a third party seller, so he included everything listed.I think you have to read each listing if used and see what they are including.
Are you able to watch Netflix, Hulu, etc. on this console?

Why did this xbox come only with the xbox console? and not the cords!!!!!!

does it come with everything shown in the picture?
It came with the console, one controller, power cord and HDMI cord
Does anyone know if this works with a mac?
I don't have a mac but I think it would. It depends on what you are doing with it, because it might need drivers that are not available for mac.
Does this work on the pc or only ps3
I bought this for PC use after reading some reviews. It worked on Win7 x64 for a while, but lately I've been getting error codes from it in both Windows and Linux. I finally gave up and am no longer using it, so I would advise avoiding it if you primarily intend to use it for PC. Also, it doesn't have rumble support in Windows.
Does this work with a Dualshock 1?
I assume so because it works all my ps1 and ps2 controllers but I've never tried a dualshock 1
Has anyone tried this on PC with success?
yes ,but I haven't pinpointed the driver you will need.
does anyone know if i buy this if i can use it for ps3 guitar hero game or rockband games with a guitar from the ps2
No, it doesn't. My brother bought one to use for guitar hero and it didn't work.
will this work for guitar hero if i use a ps2 guitar will it work on my ps3???
It will not unfortunately. It does work with dance pads and regular PS2 controllers. If you want a link to one that does work, check my review :)
Does anyone know if this works well with the Street Fighter Anniversary Arcade stick?
99% of the time will will work with other pc and or the ps3. I have used it on both for gaming and even used a ps1 controller. also it depends if your using it for a type of game like street fighter vs. say any other type of gaming hardware. It would but not unless the software/ game your playing allows for that type of controller to be used. and if it's not fully compatible for that software it maybe have issues if it doesnt work, you'll have to read on each type of software used before purchase and or etc. Mainly do research before you do.
I am looking for the power adapter that fits a xbox 360 elite the face of the plug is all plastic and has a narrow all open slit at the top
This power supply is NOT for the elite.
What is the voltage and amp rating?
It was for my nephew so
does this have a part number on the back?
Not that I saw.
Is this is 100-240v. Is this works for Xbox 360 pro.
I'm not sure, this one works on my old xbox360 which is not the newer slim type.
How do I know which one I need? I had two 360's and one got stolen. Apparently I had the bricks switched because the one I have left wont plug in.
Not sure, my xbox is from 2009 and i'd just recommend you look at the connections and see if they are similar
Input 220V?
No, it appears to be 110v only.
What causes burnt out power supplies for xbox 360?
Did not burn out grandson lost all hookups for Xbox so we gave for Christmas present
Is this ac to dc power converter? Curious because I know how to hook a car amp up to one but it must be dc
Thought this was a part for the Xbox a gaming system but it doesn't work at all
If I bring and xbox from europe and I use this will it work in the US
I'm assuming that Xbox makes their systems the same so I would say yes
is this for the 110V or 220V ?
110v
Is it just the battery or does it come with the screwdriver too? Whenever I add this product to my cart, it only shows a picture of the blue battery.
Screwdriver was included.
how long do the battery last?
A few hours
My GBA SP won't charge. Time to change the battery?
Time to buy another battery
When I turn on my gameboy sp it says the internal battery has run dry and clock-based events will no longer occur. will this fix my problem?
No, that is the battery within the game cartridge, which is a watch battery.
The picture says 850 mAh but the description says 600 mAh. Which is true?
Mine says 850. Works great. Holds charge as well as the original. Hope that helps
Does it increase the stock battery life?
Probably, your original battery is ten years old now and has cycled a lot of times.
Just bought this battery, but does anybody know where I can find an LCD? My original GBA SP's backlight died.
You don't actually buy a new LCD. You can buy just the little light. Installing it is a monster pain though. There are several tutorials on youtube however.
Does this come with the tri point screw driver? I ordered one that came w/ a Philips that doesn't fit.
When I purchased my replacement battery, it came with a yellow screwdriver that fit perfectly.
Does this come with the leather carrying case? (I used to own a pair of these and the case was very nice.)
YES THEY DO, VERY NICE STYLE.
Can I use in the airplane?
Yup. There's an airplane adapter included.
Are these wireless?
No.
Has anyone tried these for bike rides? Are they comfortable with a helmet and do they enough outside noise to be safe
I use mine for running, biking and cross country skiing with no problems. They fit well under a helmet or watch cap. I live in interior Alaska and have to keep them in a warm place before putting them on as the metal in the frame can give contact frostbite (like a burn blister) if I leave it exposed to outside temps too long and put it straight on. As long as you don't turn the volume up too loud, you should be able to hear cars or other people just fine. It will never be as safe as exercising on the road without them on, but I really enjoy having music or audio books while I exercise.
Does the volume controls work on both Apple and Android phones?
Yes
Are they copatible with computers?
YES THEY ARE, WORKS REALLY WELL.
Can anyone tell me where to get replacement foam covers for these earphones?
I believe you can get them on the B&O website
do you know where is the serial number so i can register my earphones? thanks
I believe it is on a sticker on the brown box they were packaged in. Don't remember for sure as it has been a while since I bought them.
does it work as hand free
Yes, you can, at least with my iPhone 5, it worked.
I have a B&amp;O A8 earhone, but now one earphone doesn't work anymore, where can I fix it?
I had the same problem, still under warranty, and the company refused to fix them. Do not send them back to B&O (who wanted $50 to fix mine). Go to a local electronics repair shop. I did that and had them fixed for $5.
Do u need xbox live to play this?
No, You don"t need Xbox Live to play this. It's really fun to play with a second player.
Does this work on an xbox kinect?
If you have an Xbox 360 with the Kinect you can play this game but it will not use the motion sensors because it was released prior to the Kinect. This game is played with a controller.
how do you play
A is jump, X is attack, A+X is a Jump attack, AA+X is a double jump attack, B is to use the force, Y is to change characters, B also builds things that need construction in order to complete a task or level, I may have a few buttons off atm, but if you read the instruction manual it will be very insightful on the controls. You also can break stuff and use the force with B to get coins. The blue coins are worth 2000, gold is worth 100, and silver are worth 10. The more coins you get, the more things you can buy; such as characters or lego model kits (ships and such). Fun if your a star wars fan, great for kids. Hope this helps a little bit.
Does this work on an xbox kinect?
NO, it's an old game. Kinect didn't show up when it was developed

yes, and they work great and are at a great price!
how many batteries are included in this. just 1 with choice of colors or all those in the picture?
When I ordered it, it was just one battery and no choice of colors for the back.
Will this work with the IC charging station in which you don't have to remove the protective sleeve to place the remote on the charger? (It stays via
I just replaced the batteries in my remote and did not have to remove them to fit in charger supplied with my Wii system. They just fit the charger and the back of the covers have contacts that match the charger to the remote without removing the shell nor battery. Charging lites come on and change colors when fully charged.
I currently have a Psyclone Charge Station for Wii, Model PX6502. Just stopped working. How do I replace just the charging station?
You'd have to buy a new one
Does this work with the Wii Plus remotes?
Yes it does. I have 2 wii plus remotes I use with these batteries.

Sorry, Virginia, I do not know the answer to that.
Will this work with XBOX ORIGINAL controller? will it work in Windows 8?
This works with the Xbox Original Controller, however I am not sure about Windows 8 as I use Windows 7 and Mac OS X. This works great under those two operating systems. I do not see why it would not work as long as the driver installs.
I am wanting to use this adapter on my xbox contoller to connect to my Xbox 360 usb port to play games. Will it work for that?
No, I've tried it. This cable is for connecting your old xbox controller to a computer where, along with some downloadable software, you can use it to play games.

Yes
Will this work with a racing wheel? I have an old universal racing wheel I want to hook up to my PC instead of buying a new wheel at 10x the cost.

nope. original xbox only. 360 controllers do not need any adapters to work with windows OS.
Anyone know the length on these?
About 20 inches
I'm playing the Boy version, on the info screen there's a blue book and the letters "OP". What do these mean? Thanks.
The blue book signifies a recipe book, a cookbook if you will. The number, which is actually 0 (zero) P not OP shows how many recipes you've actually cooked. Once you cook one recipe, the number will go up.
Hello there, i would like to know, can i pay the shipment, and you post "Harvest Moon Boy and Girl" to France ???
No ship to US only
Where can I catch the King Fish(Sea Bream)?
Go to the beach and fish.
When is the best time to go fishing?
Well, neither the guide nor the game developers really say what the best time is, but I've found that when I go fishing, there tend to be more bites on rainy days at any time, and on sunny days from about 7-9am and 6-10pm. Also, I tend to get the most bites in the river on the farm, just below the chicken coop and nearby the bridge. This may not be true for everyone, it just seems to be the case when I play. Hope this helps!
Where can I find the recipes?
watch the t.v.
I'm playing the Boy version, on the info screen there's a blue book and the letters "OP". What do these mean? Thanks.
The blue book signifies a recipe book, a cookbook if you will. The number, which is actually 0 (zero) P not OP shows how many recipes you've actually cooked. Once you cook one recipe, the number will go up.
Hello there, i would like to know, can i pay the shipment, and you post "Harvest Moon Boy and Girl" to France ???
No ship to US only
Where can I catch the King Fish(Sea Bream)?
Go to the beach and fish.

Does this work on Windows 8 PC's
Yes it can. I installed it on my laptop that currently has windows 8 and I can play both just fine. You may have to try going through the "forces of corruption" three times. I had to start it three times before it would actually work. However, i don't have do it every single time. It was only in the beginning.
support for Saitek JOYSTICK?
I don't know if there's any such support, but since this game is essentially a spaceship RTS and not a flight simulator, I really, really doubt it.
Can you download a mod to change it to the clone wars?
There are a lot of nods for it. So probably.
is it about the clone wars pleace answere
This game is not about the clone wars....
Lot of the reviews said it was just the original game, but you stated it was the Gold Pack .Is that true?
Yes..I ordered and received the Gold pack
I place the game in my DVD RW drive and it doesnt run at all even when i go into my computer and start it that way no luck any answers guys?
Download again
will this work on windows 7 64-bit system
Yes, I have a Windows 7-64-bit system and it works just fine.
i was install the game in my pc but the system require the eaw dvd, so i cant play the game, please help me
You can also download it off Steam. Steam is a free download. Make a free Steam account, download Steam, and buy the game
this game have 2 dvd?
No, I think they fit it all on one DVD, if I recall.
Will this include a Steam key? In other words can I activate this through Steam DRM?
I'm not sure if you can. It may be possible but this is a question for STEAM support. STEAM offers the game as well. I would purchase it through STEAM if possible.
I read that you can mount two of these side by side and change the knobs so that you will have a 6-lever quadrant. Has anyone done that?
Yes you can. With my setup i have the yoke, rudder pedals and two throttle quadrants and it works great!
can you use itnfor reverse thrust??
when you move the levers below the detent at the bottom, they hit buttons, these buttons are programmable, and can be programmed to reverse your thrust. I've been using these for two years and it works great for just that. If you fly a turbo prop, you can have one for fuel cut off, and more.
Does it work with Windows 8.1 and is it compatible with a CH stick?
I can't confirm whether it will work with windows 8, But I can answer your question about the CH stick one. It is its own Joystick with its own USB interface. It operates as a stand-alone device thus you can use any other stand-alone Joystick along with it. Hence, yes. It will be compatible with your CH Product.
The saitek three lever pro throttle quadrant (pz45) is connected via usb to pc . could add a photo of the throttle quadrant with its cable please ?.
Hello, The Pro Flight quadrant (pz45) is a usb connected peripheral that can be used together with the throttle quadrant that comes with our pro flight yoke for multi engine function.
My quadrant came with the suction cup part not attached to the mounting part which screws in to the back. Is this normal? How do I get it in?
It it's the way they come. Insert the turn screw into the mounting bracket and then press the suction cup onto the end of the turn screw. You need to apply a fair amount of pressure and it will pop into place. It does not come attached since you can attach the throttle to the bracket in one of two places, depending on where you are mounting it.
Where can I get my Quadrant repair. It just stop working?
I'm not quite sure. Try contacting Saitek or view there website to troubleshoot it to see if it may just be a driver issue or a software issue.
will it work on windows 8
I recently purchased a serious computer for my flight simulator which makes use of the SAITEK add on equipment. I could not get Flight Sim X to work with windows 8 and have downgraded my machine to windows 7 and everything works perfectly. My suggestion is to stay away from windows 8 or 8.1 or whatever they launch next. Good Luck
how long is the usb chord?
Hi, I cant remember exactly - I seem to think its around 500mm, it has to be close the the USB port. I run all mine to a 12 port powered USB and extend that to the PC
I contacted Saitek and their current stock has red line segments at the bottom of each, does the ones you'd be shipping have those?
No
USB connectivity?
Yep. Connects fine via hubs and direct to mainboard
does it function on a mac?
Yes, without any issues
I need to replace my CH yoke, it is failing once again&gt; Has the Phantom Keystroke problem been resolved?
I haven't had the issue at all and I've had it for 2 years. by reading reviews I think it was solved in fall 2008.
Have all the issues been resolved? Saitek's forum doesn't offer much hope - can anyone say whether the issues have been corrected?
This is what I found on the Saitek forum (http://www.saitekforum.com/showthread.php?t=13941). There does seem to be a fix, in essence, do not load the Saitek drivers and let FS recognize the new device and a couple of other recommendation about controls 9, 10 and 11 and about adjust the config file. I am in the same situation (Nov. 2011) as Android and I guess I will go ahead and buy it. Will post the results of the experiment. Regards, Yves.
Does this have the 90degree of turning from center like the Cessna version of the yoke?
no, 45 degree rotation
what instrument which is not included?
Not sure what exactly you're asking. This comes with the yoke and one 3-lever throttle. The other "instruments" from Saitek (ADI, Heading, Alt) as well as the Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals are sold separately
How bad is the tendency for this yoke to "stick" and "bind" when using both ailerons and elevator at the same time?
My yoke doesn't bind. Sensitivity is adjustable within the software. Mechanically speaking, mine works fine.
i am havin windows 8.1 will it work
Yes it will work as it is not the system that will cause it not to work it is the game/program that you might have problems' with.
will it work without the throttle control? Also what's the best flight simulator software to use? Thanks
Yes, xplane 10 has a lot of settings for the yoke.
will this work combined with CH rudder pedals?
Hello, The rudder pedals operate different axis so ideally this should work, however since they are both different third party drivers there is a slight possibility that there maybe a conflict.
Anyone else have problem with buttons no longer working? The entire left side of my yoke including hatswitch suddenly stopped working.
No problems so far. All features are working perfectly so I'm afraid I can't be much help.
Does it work for reading PSX/PSOne memory cards?
Its a piece of crap that cant support more then 2 controllers
You said you tested this multitap with your own PS2. Which model version is your PS2?
I tested the multitap on the very first version, not the slim.
Is this device for sure compatible with the PS2 Slim SCPH-75001?
Well my ps2 system is the regular version so I would not be able to give you a straight answer... But my "guess" is that it should work with the PS2 Slim
my friend got me one and i cant figure out how to work it
Only certain games use this accessory, and different games tell you to connect the controllers differently. Check the manual for the game you want to use it with for details. If you don't have the manual, ask in an online forum either one for video gaming in general, or one specific to that game.
Rummikub: Does anyone know if this includes Rummikub?
yes, but under the name "rummy squares."
does this version have Zilch?
Yes, it does.
What games are actually on this ? is there Gravity Tiles and Majong and Backgammon etc.????
The version I have (2007/2008) has the games you ask about plus 24 more, some very good and some not so. Double cross word game is very good, plus the slide tile game is a real favorite. Well worth the money for these games.
Will this 2008 version work on Windows 8? Thank you Cee Cee
Yes it does work.
Does anyone know if this is compatible with Windows 8 operating system?
Yes. I play Hoyle games esp. the card games.
what games are on it
Backgammon battling ships, bump em, checkers, Chinese checkers, chest, dominos, crazy contraptions, tile games, master match, maximum pool, maze racer, maze Raider, parchisi, panic, placer racer, raise, Reversi, rummy squares, rUnes of Avalon, solitaire arcade, star collector, sodoku, time breaker, word games, yacht, and zilch.
Is the game Bump Em on this
yes.
Who designed the dancing cow? Did they ever work for Chick-fil-a?
The game wouldn't work on Windows 7mso I returned it.
Buying dice colors with Hoyle bucks? Does anyone know how to enable the option to buy different colored dice (in the games that have dice) with Hoyle bucks?
Go to Hoyle Bucks in the Game Items section, and continue to scroll through the items until you see the items for sale that you can't see beforehand. In other words, the "invisible" items. Click "Buy" or "Purchase" next to each one of these, and you'll have all of your colored dice. I also was interested in using the colored dice, but after trying each of these different colors, I personally decided that the white and cream colored dice were the best looking ones, even though they were the colors already unlocked to use when I first installed the game. The various colors such as red, green, purple, and other ones didn't make the Zilch game any more entertaining to play. By the way, does your "Help and Strategy" section work at all? When I click on that, nothing happens.

sorry, I don't remember; I just played solitaire and I no longer use the Hoyle card games
Can I play it on windows 8?
Yes
Does this version of canasta have to have a partners setup for play, or can you play one on one against the computer?
You set up your face and you play against only computer partners. For Canasta, it is 4 players, you and a partner and two others. You are the only real person but you can select your preferred computer people to play with. I personally like Harley and Jack and Elaine.
can i play this game on window 8
I looked on the back of the CD holder. It says "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: WINDOWS Vista, XP I'm using it on my Apple laptop OSX. It doesn't say anything about Window 8. Wish I could help more.
can you play this on windows 7
I don't know. I have an Apple MacBook Pro and it works fine. Sorry I can't be of more help. It is a nice program when you want to relax and play cards. When you are on the computer it will ask if you have have one or more players. I always have one and I can play fine. Hope you get your answer.
does it play on mac osx10.6.8?
Yes it does.

What is the model?
PlayStation 2 Console Slim - Black; SCPH-90001 CB / 97706 There's no actual "Model" name or number listed on the outside of the box.
you can play ps 1 games on the original ps2, can they be played on the ps2 slim?
Yes, it plays both play station 1-2. Play station 2 needs bigger memory cards..compared to play station 1. It kind of nice, one doesn't have to replace all their play station one games..
can it play the ps1 games like the ps2 original did?
Yes ma'am. I had no problem playing any of my couple dozen PS1 games on this version of the PS2. However, you will need PS1 memory cards, not PS2 memory cards, to save your PS1 game.
what's the hard drive space?
There is no hard drive, you need to have memory cards for a ps2
is this really a new playstation 2 system?
Yes
can you use atari controllers on ps2
I'm guessing you have this controller and not the console? I would say no because the ps2 has 8 sets of male leads which the factory controller plugs into then you would have to take into account the size of the plug of the controller and the console housing. So if you're gonna get a ps2 it should already come with 1 controller if not just spend the extra & get 1 that will 4 certain work.
How long has your ps2 lasted?
I've had my first PS2 for about 8yrs. compaired to my son's PS3 which only lasted for 3yrs.
will this work with my PS1 games as well as my PS2?
Yes it can.
Can you SKIP through cutscenes on most games on PS2?
Yeah
Does this PS2 have a HDMI output or is it just AV cables?
Just AV jacks.
can you use theese with rock band 5
You mean Guitar Hero 5?
Do you have to have xbox to play these or can they be used as just drums?
If you play them without the xbox then they won't sound like drums. It'll just sound like sticks hitting a rubber surface. So technically you could, but it wouldn't be anywhere close to a real set. Now if you play them WITH the xbox it will sound more authentic, because depending on which game you use to play it might have an option for Free Style which would allow the user to play the drums like a real set without having to play to a specific song.
Is this a wireless drum set?
No, the Rock Band 2/3 drum set is wireless.
Does it come with drum sticks?
Yes It does ! Mine came with official rock band drumsticks (:
Are these cm payable with rockband 3?
yea but they are not that great.
Are these Rock Band 1 or Rock Band 2 drums? I need Rock Band 2 to attach cymbals to that aren't compatible with Rock Band 1 Drums.
The picture I see is an Rock Band 1 and the cymbals will not work. The Rock Band I bought my grandson is a Rock Band drum set 2 and battery operated and the cymbals will work on it for the XBOX 360. Hope that was helpful to you!
is it compatible with band hero games
Yes it is. I have Band Hero, Rockband 1&2, Beatles, and Guitar Hero Metallica, and the set works with all of them.
Is this an auto-centering joystick?
Yes
will this work for ps3
yes
Does it work with Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead?
I use a way older version of this flight stick and it works although you have to bind each control independently.
is it force feedback?
No.
Is this Thrustmaster compatible with PS2?
There is a PC/PS3 Switch on the left rear of the Thrustmaster. For a list of Backwards Programmable compatible games to PS3 from PS2 and earlier, Wikipedia is one link to check; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_3_backward_compatible_PlayStation_2_and_PlayStation_games
I'm pretty abusive at times and sometimes break a joysick (Logitech and Saitek) in stressful combat or under duress. Is this stick durable?
So far I'd say it's very durable; the stick is thick and study and the unit is heavy enough so that with my right hand resting on it, (I'm leftie) it does not move; played NHL hockey, flight games, and MW4 (yes it still plays) so far and everything is great - the programmable part is cool, and it is tight and responsive and I would say very accurate. This is a keeper - it's my 2nd I have a very old one from when it first came out, and it works but is a little slower and less buttons. This is near-perfect. The only fault is it is right handed, but manageable with lefties.
can i use this to play Star Citizen?
Yes
Is it easy to configure for X-Plane 10
Sorry I don't know. I have it configured for Raise of Flight
will this work with windows 8
yes I use it with windows 8.1
Will this joystick work with XP?
yes indeed ...I have XP
If I buy a used version that comes without online codes, does that mean I will not be able to download the free weekly puzzles?
I think you should still be able to download the weekly puzzles.
Cartridge only or does it have the case?
Comes with the case, at least it did when I bought it
Do you ship to mexico?
Yes

why does this one have fewer keys? why does this one have fewer keys than the other g15
I have the original G15 and I hope it never breaks since the change was pretty drastic. The color orange is good since when I have a lot of white on my monitor the keys are barely readable since the reflection from the monitor makes my blue keys hard to see. I currently use 14 of the keys, most with shortcuts to programs. I memorize where they are and I have one button access to them. The fewer keys now means that I will now I have to use the M button to toggle and then select. This adds another step, but I guess it's fine since I only use 14 of the 54 keys provided. I rarely use them in-game.
what's the release date of this new version?
yeah but why does the product description look like it's from the olver version of the g15 kb. Product Description Stay in the game with the Logitech G15 keyboard. The tilt-able, backlit GamePanel display lets you keep tabs on messages, see game status and monitor many types of system information - all while you're still in the game. 18 programmable macro keys give you the ability to easily create up to 54 custom macros per game and the cool blue backlit characters on every keycap help you keep playing until late. It even features a full-speed USB hub and convenient cable routing channels for your mouse and headset!o hitting that button accidentally won't end your game.The Logitech G15 keyboard is completely customizable to help you play better. Try it and you'll never go back to a standard keyboard.
Does this keyboard work with WIN7?
Yes, the keyboard and the software that comes with it is compatible with windows 7 and 8.
Any way to get this or other gaming keyboard to work on Mac WoW?
It says that it supports Mac OSX..
Is this really in stock? Anybody know whats going on?
I have the same problem.
what computer did you use for this game, brand and version.
My laptop is a HP; windows 7. Hope this info is helpful. Have a Great Day!
Can it work on windows 7?
Yes, it works on windows 7!
Is this a physical copy or a download?
It is a physical copy
Does it work with Window 8?
I do not know if it works with Window 8. I have Window 7 on my pc. Sorry. Harold
Why did I receive a Xbox 360 copy? Can it be used on the computer still?
It will still say Microsoft on it even if it is a PC version. if you did get an Xbox 360 copy then contact them, it won't do anything on your computer.
Does this disc need to be in the drive to play or can I buy one disc and two kids play on separate computers
You have to put the disc in the drive to play. Hope this will help you. Harold
Do you have to have this disc in the computer to play it
Yes.
will it work on mac or is there another version for mac?
don't use mac my os is windows and it works ok on it.
Will these work with the PMDG 737NG ?
George, The panel works with everything in FSX. I have a 'mixed-bag' hangar full of 200+ freeware and payware craft and all my Saitek panels work with all my planes/boats/vehicles without fail. Actually the panels make a lot of freeware pieces more fun due to a lot of them having a 2D 'pit instead of a VC. Like I put in the review, I liked the first two FIPs I got so much that I had to get two more! You will not be disappointed.
Does the FIP work with DCS aircrafts, especially the A-10C?
they only certify their fip on msfsx. they do not comment on other sim engine
Is there a max power/current rating on these? My USB hub is already stressed out. Looking at buying this &amp; another hub to support multiple devices.
I really don't know if it's any help to you, but I've got a radio panel, auto pilot panel, switch panel, & a throttle control, all plugged into a 7 usb holder, I do have a spare 7 usb holder, if I need it, the altimeter panel goes straight to my PC. Hope this might be of some help to you. Chas
Can it work with a mac and x-plane 10?
Not unless you boot camp into windows
Does the attitude indicator support full 3 axis 360&deg; readings? I would prefer the grey/black ball like an Apollo FDAI for space sims. Possible?
Personally they were not what I expected. I bought three of them and right now they are in a drawer collecting dust. I bought them based on the reviews but apparently these people that reviewed them are on their payrool or easily impressed. I found them to be flakey on their readouts, they are very small and the knobs are hard to work with. They do not preform as well as they are advertised either. Forget about tech support. I also found them to be a little too arrogant when it comes to telling them what is wrong with their product, and no help in correcting them. They might be good for a desktop flyer, but they did not live up to my expectations and I would not have bought them if I had not been misled on what programs they can be used for. They do not work with FS2002,FS2003, FS2004, FS9 but again flakey. They do work with FSX. (not the way I would like)Maybe you will have a better use for them than I did. They sure are not worth the money they are asking for them either. Good Luck
Can you ONLY use the 12 Saitek provided instrument modes, or can you customize them, or develop your own.
Hello! You can download new gauges from the internet (Google "Saitek FIP Gauge,") and/or you can make your own one (you write the XML). There are instructions provided on FSX Times by Tom Tsui, located here: https://fsxtimes.wordpress.com/ . He's also got some free gauges, some paid gauges, instructions, setups, etc. It's a great resource. You are not limited to Saitek's gauges, there are lots of customization options.
Can I used like a gps, vor ils ...? I just conect it with the usb? o it needs downloads? it funtions with window 8?
I haven't found a GPS gauge for it, it does have a VOR NAV gauge, it does connect via USB, you can download additional gauges but they are not required, and it sort of functions with Windows 8. You have to download .NET Framework 3.5 to interface with it for Windows 8 since the software is built for XP (Saitek, for the love of God, update your software). Once you've downgraded your .NET Framework and made it active, the FIPs will work.
Are there any drivers to interface with FS 2004 COF?
no
Hello, this instrument supports P3D V2 it? Buy.
Yes
Will the GPS display on the pro flight instrument panel? I dont see it as part of the 12 instruments.
Pro flight instrument is used to show aviation instrument info.. if you want to show a map with gps location you can export out and show on a monitor
Q: Is this program compatible with Windows 8?
Yes.
Is this program compatible with Windows Vista?
Yes. If you're not going on line to do multiplayer, no problem. But to play online, you need all the updates and install the oldest in first. I really liked playing Combat Flight Simulator 2 a lot, too. Anyway, Microsoft shutdown their servers so multiplayer's a thing of the past. If you can find #2 get it. Course you need a joy stick. If you want to go online to play a multiplayer combat flight sim, try Aces High or Warbirds. Look them up on Google. Hope this helps.
Will it work on windows 7
Google will now answer questions like this by just typing question. The answer came up: To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
what air combat game ww2 will operate in windows 7 64 bit
Donald- I finally got CFS3 to work on my Win7-64. I had to go into the control panel to software installation. Run compatibility program.
will this be able to run on windows 8 someday? I loved this game when I had XP.
It doesn't work on windows. 8
Can anyone tell me if this game works with Logitech extreme 3D pro joystick on windows 7?
It will work with windows 7, 32 bit, 64 bit has some problems and it will work with the extreme 3D joystick -- to some degree -- some of the features of the joystick don't work as they do with MS flight simulator. You can fly with it, engine speed, up, down, right, left so on, but some things such as bomb, rockets are controlled by the keyboard. At least I haven't found where those buttons are?? Don't expect the same results that you can get with regular flight simulator. Good luck.
Is it compatible with windows 8?
No, Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 3 is only able to be played on Windows 7/XP.
Can this be played with just a mouse?
no you have to have a flight stick
is Logic Tech extreme 3D Joystick compatible with this game? If it is any special setup?
Yes it is, but to be honest I don't think combat flight SIM is that great of a game I would suggest IL2 instead
will this game work on Windows 7 64bit?
Yes, it doesn't work on windows 8/8.1 so of course it works with windows 7! :D
will this work with the PS4???
No
Do you need a PSMove controller in order to operate the PSEye camera itself?
Technically, no, it will work on it's own, but in such a limited manner you are best off picking up a move controller.
does this have the tv clip or do you need one
No you don't need a clip and it does not have a tv clip. It can sit on top of the tv or where ever you want to put it.
So it can be used as a regular webcam on a Windows 7 laptop with some free driver downloads, Will work immediately as a webcam/cam on ps3?
Yes and yes. Watch this video to see how to install on windows 7 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ujCN5euIhc
Can I use this as a a TV cam for Skype Calls?
I am not familiar with Skype per say but I do know that once you download the driver for this cam it can be used as a standard webcam which I've used as a security camera so I suppose it should work with Skype as well once you download the actual driver from code laboratories should cost you a $1.99 for the driver.... search for code laboratories ps3 cam driver on Google
Okay, simpleton question; does this plug into the PS3 or into a computer? Told you...;-)
Ps3
How easy is this to set up with a Windows PC?

Does this game play on windows 8?
Charles, just loaded this game on my Windows 8 computer and have played around six hours with no problems whatsoever. Happy gaming!
I have bought 2 titan quests games and cant seem to install this on to my laptop. Just curios if any one may know whats going on?
Have you verified the requirements are supported by your cpu?
I have windows 7 can I install it? I just bought it
Yes - you can install on Windows 7
Can you play this on Vista with 64 bit?
Yes. That is what I play it on. No problems except you have to put the Titan disc in to start game every time you play.
Includes Spanish language?
Yes, it has several languages, including Spanish
Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Multiplayer feature allows for 2-6 players to play on the same server. This uses a centralized pairing system run by Gamespy
DRM, no internet or phone registration required?
I do not believe that internet or phone registration is required. The registration key is included in the package.
is this one backward compatible?
If this is the Metal Gear Solid 4 ps3 40Gb bundle, then Yes, Otherwise No. The only 3 PS3 systems that are Backwards Compatible are the Fat 20Gb ps3, the Fat 60gb Ps3 (best recommended console), and the Fat 80gb ps3 (doesn't play certain ps2 disc-based games)
Can you play any game for ps3 on this system?
You can play all PS3 game discs, most PSOne discs, and digital games downloaded from the PSN. You CANNOT play PS2 discs in this model. However, some PS2 games have been remastered and are available as downloads for the PS3 thorough the PSN.
does it come with controlers
One.
can you can you play nba live 2003 and NBA live 2004 on the PS3?
we have played nba14 on yours so i dont see why not
does it come withgames
mine didn't. I bought mine used. it had some issues but over all it's a good system. if it doesn't have one already, then you'll need to buy an hdmi cord for Blu-ray discs, and to enhance video game graphics. I suggest buy a relatively cheep cord here on amazon.
Can you jail break this model ? Which model is this ( cech) ?
don't see why not
Is the online free?
Yes standard online service is free but you have to pay for sonys storage for copy protected saves...i dont think it costs to play games online or anything? Just setup a PSN account & your good to go i think?
Is this the first model?
Yes
-2 votes Bring power and control cable?
your question is not clear, please rephrase your question so I can help you.
what ps3 system will play ps2 games
Mine didn't work had to send back sorry
Will this work with emulated games on a pc? Not that I would ever download something without paying for it..
In the hypothetical situation where one does download and play an emulated game, it works very well with not only the controller layout being similar to commonly emulated systems (SNES, N64), but also is very responsive. I use a regular PS2 controller myself and in my 'hypothetical situation pod' I see myself playing and enjoying emulated games that I have never personally downloaded in reality.
Works on Windows 8.1 of 64 bit?
Yes
Will this work for connecting a PS2 dance pad to the PC, or does it suffer from that problem where it renders the step pad controls as axes?
It will likely make them be axes. I purchased one to convert my yamaha ms1 handlebars to PC. It worked great for that.
my computer dont recognize my usb converter?
Firstly, what operating system are you using? Compatibility issues might be your problem; I can't seem to find what OSes this device is compatible with on the listing. I use mine with an old Windows XP computer and it recognizes fine. Secondly, maybe your converter is broken. Try it on different computers and see if you get a different response. If it doesn't recognize on any computer, there's a chance you might've received a dud. I'd ask for a refund/exchange. Hope you get it working. I didn't have any issues with mine.
it works for connecting a ps2 controller to a windows pc?
Yes
Are these compatible with Mac iOS X?
Yes.
Would this work with a Macbook Air?
Yes it uses the universal HID codec for usb. Works on my iMac should work on your macbook pro
can this work on a ps2 logitech wireless controller?
if you can hook up any ps2 or 1 controller in it, it should work.
Does it work with a super slim PS3?
Yes. It does. I use it daily.
Will this work with the with the PS4? I have a red octane joystick I would like to use with my ps4.
No

Yes. Perfectly fine.
Medieval II Gold Pack can you hook to computer together to play multiplayer?
Yes
can this game run on a mac book pro
No
do you get paper maps with MEDIEVAL II TOTAL WAR - GOLD pack ?
no you don't unfortunately but once you learn the game and play long enough you'll learn the map. I've been playing since the medieval total series came out and own all the games along with their expansions, so feel free to ask any other questions ok bye jungo467
could it run on a mac?
I don't know

Not within the game itself.

yes runs fine on windows 7, I'm on 7 home premium, using a 64 bit system, and it runs great with no problems
Has this been upgraded to run on Windows 8....64 bit ?
No
will this run on mac
Although this program can be run on a Mac in a Windows emulator, a better solution is to get Optimum Video Poker (OpVP) which will run native on any Mac OS X 10.2 or later, including Yosemite. Of course it will also run on any Windows 2000 or later, including Windows 8. OpVP is also a true trainer by displaying the strategy chart of your choice next to the game window and highlighting your errors in the chart.
which video poker games this Cd has?
CD has Jacks or Better, Bonus Poker, Double Bonus Poker , Double Double Bonus Poker , Triple Bonus Poker and maybe two others. I can't remember all. But a very good CD with tutorial etc.
which poker games it has? I know it has?
I got it for my wife for a practice format because she plays the video poker machines in Reno quite a bit. It appears that there's about 2 dozen games on it.
Will the Winpoker work with Microsoft 8.1?
it has not worked for me on 8.1.
Does it play in Windows 7?
Yes, this game most definitely does play in Windows 7.
what about windows 8.1
Not sure. Perhaps the game's official website might have some information.
Do you have to have the disk in when playing?
On Windows 7: yes.
do you have to hook this up to our tv?
As this is a computer game, there is no need to hook this up to your TV. Now if you have a screen no bigger than a watch face then I'd say if your able to hook that up to your TV then most definitely do it. I run this on my laptop and it's just fine. Enjoy!
Does this monopoly game play fine in Windows 8 pro and RT?
yes
Is this a physical copy or a digital copy? Does it matter?
Physical, but you still have to set up a Blizzard online account to play it. However, it makes a good flying projectile to ward off the zerg... Maybe the line between reality and fantasy is beginning to blur in my old age...
Does it work on Windows 8.1?
Yes it does I have it on 8.1 and it runs just fine.
Is this the base game?
Yes this is the entry to the storyline of SC2. Wings of liberty is the first of 3, Heart of swarm will be the next one you'll want and coming out in a year I believe will be Legacy of the void very good games
Can I buy this used or will the DRM kill me ?
If someone already used the product key, you will still need to purchase a product key, so it would be like buying the game all over again. I wouldn't suggest buying it used, because you can download the starter edition for free and then just buy a product key from blizzard.
does this version work on a mac? it seems like you can only shop for this version of the game. I have mavericks, will this work on my macbook pro
Yes sir, it sure does. As long as your system setting are beyond that of the requirements you can play this on your Mac. Check out the details here if you're interested: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/starcraft-ii-system-requirements
I bought StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty on the PC but I am unable to play online multiplayer. The game says I have the "Starter Edition"? Did I miss something, isnt this the full version of the game?
Until you put in your code, it will be starter edition. Visit battle.net, log in with your account, and then redeem a code for Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty. The code comes in the box, and you probably have to scratch it off or something similar, I can't remember.
If i want to play this game offline without internet support ? What do i do ? i need details in order to know what to do ?
The game does require a broadband internet connection. Offline mode is available only in those circumstances where you temporaily lose a connection in which you may continue to play for that session only. Even then you have to login as a "guest" even though you own the game. Guest privileges only last 30 days before you have to login to a live internet connection to re-register the game. Otherwise, you are locked out of your own game. Kinda sucks doesn't it?
So this is like Warcraft you have to play on line.. I hate that
It does have a story mode.
Will this update some how create this hacked copy the only benefit to buying it is Multi-player access online ? And allow me to play solo campaigns?
It's not a hacked copy and yes you will be able to play multi-player and solo campaigns.
Can I instal on my two PC? Or is only for one PC?
You should be able to install it on as many computers as you want... there is no license limit on it like OS software.
Do you need an internet connection to play this game?
No and I highly recommend this game to improve your poker game! Can play more hands per hour than even online poker sites if you choose to skip all the AI reaction time or skip to next hand once you fold.
Does it work on Windows 8?
Richard H., the answer is yes, Master Poker does run on Windows 8. Windows 8 considers all software that worked on previous versions of Windows to be 'legacy' software. Win8 comes with a new desktop look, but still allows you to switch to the old familiar legacy Desktop, where it will run many legacy software programs. It will not run all older software written in every programming language, but it will run all software written in one of Microsoft's programming languages, which Master Poker, fortunately, is. Hope this answers your question. / SS
Will my MS windows7Home Premium (64 Bits) work for your Master Poker Prof. no-limit Texas Hold'em ?
Yes...I use Win 7 64 bit and it works great
Will it play correctly on an Alienware 64 bit operating system?
I am using the 64-bit version of Windows 7 Professional Edition Service Pack 1 and have no problems with Master Poker. If you are running the Home Edition you will probably be OK but I would definitely recommend an upgrade to the Professional Edition.
Thank you Ronda, but it didn't work. When I select my operating system all it lets me select is Windows 7 &amp; I have Windows 8! Does anyone have a contact for the website? I have tried the support numbers on the website, but no luck?? HELP!!!
A note from the developer: There is no place in Master Poker where you must input the type or version of your Windows operating system. The address for tech support is all over your receipt and on the back of your CD. You can also write me directly through Amazon. Help is always here if you seek it in the right place, but I can't help if you don't contact me directly.
Is this version 2 or the original version 1?
Mine says V2.0.1
I'm new to poker. Is there a tutorial to help people learn the rules? Does the license permit using this on two computers my desktop and my laptop?
Funny, Everybody is new at poker... This CD is by far the best tutorial ever.Best money I spent in a long time.Hours upon hours of fun.
Does the software provide training insight into a players leaks or habits?
Not that I am aware.
I have Master Poker Ver 2.01 is this a later version ?
Not sure.When I bought the product there was an Email address from the developer. Hope this helps.
Do you need steam?
No Internet connection of any kind is required.
Does it work with andriod phones as well?
Yes it does. I just use it in PS3, but after your question I tried in my Galaxy S5 and it worked well
How long will it be to ship to California?
7-15days
WIll this headset work with xbox 360 chat?
Unfortunetly it wont because xbox 360 doesnt support bluetooth and its a bluetooth headset so theres no way to connect it hope this helped.
can you hear your game sound when on xbox live
I have a ps3 but yes it's very good
does it work on a computer
Most likely if you computer has Bluetooth.
Will this headset work with xbox 360 chat?
I think so, I have PS3 and 4, but I think it works on every Bluetooth connection.
does this play the game sound or just chat
Don't buy
does it work with ps4
It didn't even work with my PS3. Save your money and listen to the reviews on here. The official Sony bluetooth headset works much better and for only $15 more.
can I listen and watch movie with this headset
Yes
can it work for the PS Vita
Sorri, I haver no idea. But if PS Vita had a bluetooth connection i think it might work.
will it play on windows 8 ?
dont know but they have a web site http://www.matrixgames.com/products/319/details/John.Tiller's.Battleground.Civil.War
Will this run on Windows 7 (one of the answers seems to imply that it does but it's not explicit)?
The instructions say it runs on XP, Vista and Windows 7. It runs fine on Vista.
Will this program be compatible with XP or windows 8
Should work with XP but I don't know about windows 8.
can you use it on a black xbox 360
Yes, the color of the Xbox doesn't matter. My Xbox is a Ryse (Black) and this cord still works just perfectly on it.
How long is the cord?
It's a little over 3 feet. I was disappointed since the last one I had was longer.
Are these cables originals?
No they are not they are cheap knock offs spend a couple more dollars and get the real deal unless you want a 3 foot cable that is the cheapest quality
Will it work without the battery pack?
yes it will work without it
Can I use this with a wireless controller for PC with a AA battery pack?
Probably not
does this work like a wired controller and will be able to use it on my mac for computer games????
Yes you can use it on a Mac. You'll have to download and install a driver for it to work though. Just google "xbox 360 controllers driver for mac" and pick one of the top links. I was able to make the controller work with Steam (specifically Portal 2).
works on pc?
It doesn't work on pc

This isn't really a question
Hi, we have a computer with Windows 7. Will it work on our computer?
Yes, that is what is on my computer. So, it definitely works. :)
Does it run on windows 8?
Yes it does.
Complete Collection version doesn't seem to have DONATION BOXES like all the other Zoo Tycoon versions. Not showing in buildings nor bench drop down.
To me it does not even matter because the complete collection has way more animals you can control and build exhibits for. It's unlimit amounts of fun in my opinion!
Is it compatible with Windows 8.1?
Yes it is.
my laptop does not have the CD-ROM how can i play it?
I'm in the same dillema. Unfortunately there is no digital version replicated yet. They do have external cd/DVD rom drives that you can plug into your laptop (in the USB port) and play it that way. Search external cd drive in amazon
Anyone tried it and able to use it on windows 8?
No
Does this game work on a laptop that has window's 8
Yea it actually does and this game is really good if your a animal person. You can build almost any exhibit for any animal you want. There's about a good 90 animals but I wish they would have included more in the game.
Does the CD have to be in the computer for the game to run?
Yes.
Does it work with Windows Vista?
Yep, I had it on vista back when vista was the newest os
Resident Evil 5 is there anything special between the Original Vs Greatest Hits
Nothing Truly, all that changes is the box color, and the fact that certain collectors prefer the original case over the greatest hits due to it's increase in popularity.
does it have subtitules in spanish?
Yes
Is it "PlayStation Move-compatible game"?
No
what about the language? spanish is available?
Hola , si el juego trae sub-titutos al espao, bueno el que me enviaron si
I got the game today and when i opened it had no booklet in it so i cant get the product code. What do i do?
To be honest I've never had this problem but my best advice would be to either contact EA or I know on YouTube they have serial codes for the base game and expansions so you could also try that but there's no guarantee that could work, worse case scenario is you return the game and purchase a new copy. Hope I cou help. ~Hannah
does it work for windows 7 and 8
Yes. My daughter has windows 7 and it works fine.
How will I be sure that this game will come with the codes necessary to install it?
Hi, thanks for asking. The factory code is printed on the back of the manual. there is only one install code. Aaron
will this run on windows 8
It does not work well on Windows 8.

I have a HP - 19.5" All-In-One Computer - 4GB Memory - 500GB Hard Drive could it run fine with some expansion packs?
Yes. I have run all expansion packs on an old Compaq with 2GB Memory and it did OK; we are currently running on a Dell laptop with 3GB Memory and it does just fine. I would not expect you to have any trouble.
Dose it work on Windows 8 ??
Mari, I don't know. I run the game on Windows 7. I did have to bypass the Launcher to play the game. A Google search does reveal issues with running Sim2 on Windows 8 (and possibly 8.1) that date back to 2013. I did ultimately find a link to the "Mod The Sims" website (http://modthesims.info/t/500523) where they describe a process of doing a clean reinstall of the game and setting each installed expansion pack to run in Compatbility Mode for Windows XP, Service Pack 2 (not Service Pack 3), see the link for details if interested. Launcher bypass method here: http://answers.ea.com/t5/The-Sims-2/Sims-2-Double-Deluxe-Launcher-Crash/td-p/2005641 Regards, Paul
how come it says you cant buy the PC Download instead of the disk?
The game was released 10 years ago, its no longer available in that format.
Does this bring the charger?
No it doesn't come with a charger. It is only the controller.
Just received a new one. Took it out of the package, plugged the charger cord in, and the controller didn't turn on. What do I do?
Ill put it back and Ill sent to amazon. I know that Amazon will give me another one that works correctly.
after charging with the charger i have how will i pair this with my console. just push the ps button or what?
I believe so. That's what my husband did with his
If it says sony on it it is genuine.
There may be imposters on the market. I would look for quality markings of the logo and features (dualshock 3, sixaxis, PS button) and the manufacturers sticker on the back, it's almost part of the controller and won't come off. Also check for weight, it has the mechanism inside for realism effects.
What size batteries do I need for the Wireless PS 3 Controller
The wireless controllers (at least the ones I've had) don't take batteries. You plug it directly into the console to charge it. The system has to be turned on for the charge to work, but after keeping the controller plugged in for 6 hours or so (for a new controller), you can unplug it again and probably go 20 or more hours before you have to charge again. The red power light on the controller starts to blink when the battery is getting low and all you have to do is plug it in again for a while.
What is the version of this Black Dualshock 3 - CECHZC2U or CECHZC2UA1 or CECHZC2UA2?
It is the CECHZC2U.
Does it come with bluetooth dongle? Mine came without it and I don't know how to connect it to PC
No, it did not come with blue tooth dongle.
Hi! I have a couple of questions...Is the black controller the original sony controller that came with your PS? Also are there any problems with the black controller?
Yeah the black one is the controller you get with the console. The controllers are all the same no matter what the color is.
If I have a bluetooh receiver for my PC, can I use this to play games wireless?
Yes you can.
Is this really a dualshock controller not a knock off??
The one I received is definitely a fake. Sold by Purchases Direct through Amazon. Playing any type of shooter game is near impossible to get right as the joysticks sensitivity is so far off. There is no fine movement with sticks. The controller I got looks just like the real thing at a glance. Once I put it in my hand and tried playing a game I instantly new something was wrong. Look up real vs fake dualshock 3 and you will find a lot of videos and pictures showing what to look for.
can you put the shifter on the left hand side
You cannot. It is a hard plastic case. If you need to have a shifter on the left, look into the Logitech G25 or G27 :)
Hello! I can use it to play the Gran Turismo 6? Thanks for help.
yes you can a real nice wheel i had mine for 5 yrs now
Will it work for a PS4?
From everything I have been reading on GTP, this won't work on the PS4 unless Sony updates it so it can be used. If you are buying this for the PS4, expect it to not work. Yes it is USB and Plug and [lay and all that stuff. But If Sony has it blocked out, It will never work.
Are any reviewers using this unit with a Windows PC?
Yes I am. I love it and use it daily. This wheel takes PC racing to a whole different level. I use it mostly on iRacing and have had good success with league racing. This unit doesn't have a clutch pedal but this feature can be set-up as "auto clutch" on almost all racing software.
Does it have paddle shifters? The product description here says so but I can't see any in the product images.
They aren't big paddles but there are buttons on the back of the wheel that are used to shift.
Deos it work with F1 2014?
Yes As far as I know but if you can make more resurch
does it work on gta 5?
My grandson used it fine on GTA
How do you or what is the sequence to re-program the controls/buttons?
Ordinarily that is done within whichever game is being played. (Perhaps I didn't understand the question)
Can this be used on PC without the AC cable if the user doesn't care about force feedback?
Yes
Is a full instruction manual included ?
The instruction manual was not in the box when I received it. but my box was heavily damaged from shipping. I understand that can happen so it may be for you. if you decide to buy it feel free to ask me anything and I can help you set it up. it's very simple and I"ll be glad to help in any way I can.
Will this stick work on mac OSX?
Yes, I've used on my iMac. I have quite an old OS (Snow Leopard... the best version of Mac OS), but I don't see why it shouldn't work on newer versions.
Has anyone successfully modded this arcade stick? Some people say the buttons holes are too small, but what about the joystick?
If you get crown buttons from ettoki you don't have to modify the holes. You can use a sanwa joystick, but most mayflash units require you to cut the sanwa pcb (it's ok you direct solder the switches). Also, you have to either Dremel the joystick screw holes or buy smaller screws. Ettoki is awesome, he sells everything, smaller joystick screws, wiring harnesses, joystick, and buttons (crown and sanwa). I ended up only using the mayflash chip and threw it into a tek innovations custom acrylic case since my mayflash stick started peeling and the case itself was a little small and my hand fell over the side if I went crazy on the stick.
does this work with mame?
Yes it will. you may need to use the tab menu to map the inputs to the stick, but it will work. Here are details on tab setup. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4dNttZbCHE&list=PL0CABFEF11F175A7A
Does this work out of the box for PC or do I need to buy the "Universal Adapter"?
Yes works out of the box. Installation cd is included, but I didn't need it. PC recognized it right away.
By chance, is there a spinner of any sort on here? I want to play Omega Race, Ikari Warriors,etc. Need to be able to spin AND move forward same time
There's no spinner. For spinning in Ikari, I configured 2 buttons, one for spinning clockwise and the other one for counter-clockwise...
is it micro switch (does it have that *click* felling)
Yes.
Has anyone tried this with Blazblue or Skullgirls? Let me know if it works on those.
Yes, I have on both. Works fine!
So this product will work on PS4? Will this console allow the character like batman on Arkum City to walk forward and run?
With the PS3 component just being a lazy solder of a controller board, chances are it won't. PS4 dropped compatibility with the PS3 USB and controller. http://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/PS4_Compatible_PS3_Devices If you want my advice, spring for a new controller or better stick. After about 8 months of use this thing finally broke down.
Hello, do I need to buy a universal adapter as well... for this univeral controller to work with my PS3? Thank you!!! :)
It comes with a USB Plug and a PS2 Plug.
Does this fight stick work with Mortal Kombat X on PlayStation 4?
Only with a controller adapter bro
Can we play offline?
Yes, you sure can it just won't be linked to the online store, or online friends
Is this the original base game for the sims 3? I can't download it I need to buy a dvd. Thanks!
Quite possibly the buyer wants to know if it says "Go Social" on the top of the box. If it does, it requires Origin and you cannot use Create-A-World's "In-Game" edit with it. Many Sims 3 creators are seeking the original DVD box before the "Go Social" version was released.
Will this work on a windows 8.1 computer?
It appears that it will but I am running a Mac Maybe you can search around on Google... Top result was:Windows 8.1 compatibility for The Sims 3 version 1 http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Type=Software&Name=The+Sims+3&ModelOrVersion=1&Vendor=EA&Locale=1033&LastSearchTerm=&BreadcrumbPath=The+Sims+3&TempOsid=Windows+8.1
Can it work with Windows 8.1?
Yes. If it doesn't, you can always use the Windows Backwards Compatibility feature.
Will this game work with Windows 8 or 8.1?
Yes it will. I have windows 8.1 and the game runs fine.
Is this game compatible with Windows 8.1?
Yes it does
Is this the one you need to buy to install in computer before you can play any other Sims3 games?
Yes this is the actual game, if you buy an expansion pack you need to make sure that this is installed first :) hope this helps
Is this the disc version of Sims 3 for Mac? I am not looking for a download, I want the physical disc. Thank you!
Yes
How large is the case itself that it comes in?
The size of a standard CD case
What languages are available in this game? Can we install it in Catal&agrave;? Or only in Spanish? Thanks for you reply!
The sims 3 I recieced did not work It never load on any of my equipment I had. Sorry I can not answere your question
Does cable length affect ping?
Not in actuality, no. Ping is a measurement of how fast data travels along the internet pathways to the server and back. This data is transmitted in the form of electricity, which is traveling at very fast speeds. An average internet connection spans hundreds of miles between the server location and the user, and typically only sees ping around 40 milliseconds (1/1000th of a second). The additional 50 feet of this cable produces no measurable effect on you internet ping and speeds, especially in relation to the scale of things.
do you need clips
Not sure what you mean by clips? If you mean to plug into the box or the PC then the answer is NO. It can plug right into the box and PC nothing else needed.
Does this work with a computer to?
Yes
which ethernet cable? anyone can recommend a good 50' ethernet cable that works the best?
This cable works well, I have two of them. The signals are digital, so the quality of the cable does not matter much. The sheathing is a little thin and loose so it doesn't feel very durable, but I have not had any problems.
I see in one of the product pictures, the cable covering is torn. Is this just for illustration of the wiring, or will my cable be defective?
I think they are just trying to show you what's inside. Mine arrived in perfect condition--no tears, no problems,
the router to connect 30 ft. away .http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00...
Do you mean "Is the router within 30 feet away?"
i have saterlite internet, i was told to hook up my xbox to the router and mine connecetion will work better dose anyone know if this is true
Yes it is true that hooking up your Xbox to your router with a cord is better and faster the wireless. I have my router right next to my Xbox one and xbox 360. I have tried it wireless and the connection drops alot more. And the beautiful thing is if you have a problem, most of the time just unplugging the ethernet cable and plugging it back in fixes it. Also reseting your router orunplugging it and plugging it back in helps as well. The choice is always corded even for controllers that on mila second makes all the difference.
does this work for the ps3 ?
It works on my PC and Xbox 360 and on my tv box so I don't see y wouldn't work on ur ps3
Will it work for my xbox 360 I have the first white one and haven't found a cable that works that's long enough
Yes
Can I use this to connect my smart tv to my computer modem? Is this the correct cable? Thanks
I use it to connect my computer to the router. As long as your smart TV accepts ethernet cords you're good to go.
Will this work with Wii Band Hero?
Yes it will!
Does this drum set also work on the Xbox 360?
No way Jose
Will this work with Wii Mini?
No
will this set work with guitar hero warriors of rock?
This is not compatible with Guitar Hero on the wii. Only the xbox and playstation versions are cross compatible.
Would this work with AC/DC Live Rock Band?? And with The Beatles?
I know for a fact that drum set works with ac/dc live. I'm not sure about the Beatles because they came out with a different drum set but the first drum set does work on Rock Band 2 so I don't see why it wouldn't work for the Beatles. I see the drum sets aren't reverse compatible the other way.
Is this wireless
No it's not. It has a long cable that plugs into the USB port of the Wii
Is this set wireless?
no this isn't wireless
Is this set wireless
I bought this quite a few years back, but I don't think so.
Does this work with Wii Rock Band 3?
Yes it does...
What i get if i buy this product? The game or the key?
You get the key and Battle net setup. You will still have to download the game
Do you still need the disk after you install the game? Can you just launch it from the battle.net client?
No you don't need the disc because you have to create an account with your key and you always have to be online.
Does this game include the CD-key?
Yes
can you play 2 people at the same time
You can play multiplayer online with two computers, but not two people on one computer.
does it work on a MAC?
definitely YES
I have 1.5 meg dsl connection,,,I was wondering if the game will stream without buffering??
that's more than enough. at most the game uses 30KB down/up.
Is this compatible to OS X too?
Yes, it's compatible with OS X. I can run it on my Macbook PRO.
I received Diablo 3 and the Reaper of Souls expansion pack for Christmas. Does the game have to be played online or can it be played offline as well?
Both D3 and ROS can only be played online; even in story mode.
does it work on Windows 8.1
It works on Windows 7... so I'm guessing it probably works on Windows 8.1.
Do you get the key immediately on purchase? Or do you have to wait for the physical box?
I guess that depends on how you purchase it. I bought a boxed game. The key was inside the box... So obviously I had to wait. If you buy as a download, I would think key was available pretty much instantly, or at least at email speed. Me, I am old school. Games should come in a box with nice graphics, not in a "cloud" some where.
Is this for adults or would it be appropriate (language, content, scariness, etc) for a 10 yr old? We've enjoyed the Nancy Drew games.
in addition (just remembered) Sherlock Holmes would be a good choice for the 10yr old...those were pretty mild. I played one of Agatha Christies games and thought it was pretty pg...only a couple parts where there is a storm outside that feels spooky like halloween a little....
Does this game work with Windows seven or just XP?
I had XP when I bought these games. But I just checked on BigFishGames which is where I bought them and it does list Windows7 as one of the Operating Systems. Many of these older games do not. I don't think you'll have any problem playing on 7 but I have had several games recently that are "compatible" with 7 that will occasionally freeze up.
this game is only language in english or in spanish too?
only in english
Is there anyone who has attempted to play this on Windows 8?
Hi Laura, I have not tried to run Syberia on Windows 8 but . . . Supposedly, going to Windows 8 from 7 does not enjoy the radical compatibility issues as going to 7 from XP. Here is one article that claims few issues will exist in the transition: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-8-Compatible-with-Windows-7-Hardware-and-Software-211576.shtml Here is a good article that discussed various scenarios: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-run-old-games-software-in-windows-8/ Here is an excellent tutorial discussing Windows 8 compatibility mode use. http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6832-compatibility-mode-use-windows-8-a.html Here is a link to a Big Fish post that suggests that their version will not run. http://forums.bigfishgames.com/posts/list/239885.page Here is a link to Microids (Microids is the original producer of Syberia) forum that talks about the game running slowly. I did not do a thorough search of the forum to see if other posts about Windows 8 compatibility exist. My best Guess: the Microids version will probably run OK; some adjusting of the game's properties through its or gfx options may be necessary. I do not know if the Big Fish version is altered from the original; that could introduce issues. Pardon my bias but I am wildly enthusiastic about this game, which I find to be challenging and just plain fun. To solve compatibility issues, I dual-boot XP/Windows 7 so I can keep running XP or earlier games that are not compatible with Windows 7. One is able to dual-boot Windows 7 and 8 - which is a viable option for you; a web search will give you many good tutorials on how to go about it. Post back if you have any questions. If it were me (it's not) I would buy grab the Microids version (you can query Amazon merchants to see what version they are selling) at least knowing that one person was able to run it on 8, albeit with some issues (that I suspect are related to his specific setup). Regardless, it, to me is worth the gamble. Ed
is this the orginal syberia or a cut up version
no its the orginal version.
does it work on windows 8?
Together with the Myst series, this is my all-time favorite game. I have played this game on XP, Vista and then I downloaded the game on windows 7 and it worked great. I don't have a win 8, however I believe Microsoft uses similar technology to allow backward program compatibility. If you like this genre, try Tunguska.
Is this controller compatible with Wii U also?
Nintendo just announced an official adapter today! Release date pending... http://kotaku.com/nintendo-made-a-gamecube-controller-adapter-for-wii-u-1583342868
Which seller did you all buy from? From the reviews, I see that there are quite a few customers that ran into counterfit sellers. Is "UJC mart Japan" a good seller?
You should be fine with UJC mart Japan. Make sure you check out not the item reviews, but the company itself. In general Japan won't be giving out counterfeits, however China and Korea are a bit more risky to order from. Hope this helps.
How long is the cord?
It's about 8 feet
Can this Controller be used with a Wii console?
Yes
Is this the type of plastic that will turn yellow after a long time of use?

Yes it does, the only thing you'd need is the Controller Adapter for the Wii U for it to work.
Does this controller come in its original box?
Yes
Is this an official Nintendo Product and does it work with US Wii consoles even though it says "Use in Japan only"?
It works on US wiis and gamecubes yes. They're not region locked.
Is the cord the same length as the Super Smash Bros Edition Controller?
The cord is 10 feet long
Does this controller have more of a glossy feel like the original gamecube controllers, or is it more matte like the Smash Bros edition controllers?
Glossy like original. I've got all three plugged in to my Wii U, and just compared them. It is pretty hard to tell the difference, but finish on this controller looks/feels most like the original game cube controller.
CAn you use this game on the wii u?
Yes, we have the Wii u. I think you can use Wii games on the Wii U but not the other way around.
do you need the motion attachment to use with remote plus for these games?
I've only just used the rechargable remotes that came with my Wii package. I did have to buy a new CD as we wore out our original game CD
I'm having trouble loading this on our WiiU console. It is not letting me get click the "TV ONLY" button to play the game on the big screen. Advice?

Is HOMM3 compatible with Windows 7 ????
Yes it is. That's what I have on my laptop, and it runs perfectly fine.
After installation, does it require the CD to play?
Yes, you do need to have the disk inserted to play. That's really the only bad part about the game, in my opinion.
After installation, does it require the CD in your computer to play?
Yes
can you play this on ps4
You cannot simply put a PS3 or PS2 game in your PS4 and play it. The systems are fundamentally not compatible with each other. Read more at http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/ps4-backwards-compatibility-can-you-play-ps3-games-on-ps4#zEYKeyDsJPIXz1Hc.99

No
The Game It's In Spanish
unfortunately i do not have a definitive answer, what i could suggest is you tinker with your closed caption/language settings on your tv set to see if this will assist you.
The Game It's In Spanish
No the game is in English
Does this game require an online pass for PS3?
No it does not. I have never used an online pass for it and it plays just fine.
How does this work with Steam? If I buy this boxed package thingy, once I get it can I just put some key into Steam and get the whole thing off there?
The point of the boxed copy is to save having to download the files from steam, other than that the online install of the boxed copy appears to be indentical to the Steam download version. I bought the boxed copy for my brother as he has a monthly bandwidth quota and a 4GB download would bite a chunk out of that. Myself I downloaded the whole thing from steam which took about 2 hours with a 6Mbit connection. We both play online on the same servers and both have to sign in to Steam to play online.
Will GTR EV. run on Windows 7, with a MOMO wheel?
Yes, it works perfectly on Windows 7...even x64.
Is this the Full Bundle standalone or expansion pack?? So is ASIN: B0018XWLKA the Full or Expansion product?
I can confirm that this item is the full & complete version .. Great deal for $20!
does this this game run on windows 8?
Worked on my windows for like a week then stopped doesn't work now
Does this game work on windows 7 ?
Yes ot dose work with windows 7 .. Just small recommendation also try company of heroes 2 amazing game
why do I have to use steam?
The game auto downloads to the stam interface, there are probably other buying options that aren't connected to steam though.
how long will it take to delivery
First Class Mail 3 days, but you can choose to expedite to USPS Priority 2 Day with tracking and insurance.
Is it a disk you put in your computer, and if so, does it install with steam? or no.
yes, it's a disc & it requires Steam.
does anyone know where the product key if you pc downloaded it
You should be able to find it on the products page in your previous orders on amazon.
Does this game run on windows 7 ?
Yes, I've played it on my previous laptop which is a Windows 7.
do you have to download the game of the disk.
In the normal set up, the entire game is downloaded to your computer. You don't need the disk after the original download to play the game, just click the desktop shortcut icon.
What are the requriements for this game and does it require STEAM to play simple campaign mode?
I dont know, it required steam to even boot up.
does this game work on windows xp
I wouldn't see why not. It was made when xp was still serviced by Microsoft. I'd should work find.
does this work with ps2 DDR pad?
John,i own a plain old PS2& the HDE PS PS2 USB Dual Controller doesn't work with it.. So ,my answer would be I don't think so
When using with PS3, is there vibration? When using with PS3, does the pressure-sensitive feature of the buttons on PS2 controllers work?
No
Does this item work with 64bit system like Win7-64bit or Win8-64bit?
Yes it does. Im using windows 8 and it works perfect but i had to download scp-ds3 package driver for it to work with emulators
Does this item work with 64bit system like Win7-64bit or Win8-64bit?
Yes, it works on win 8 64 bit, and win 7 64 bit.
would this work on xbox 360?
I don't think it will. The device was designed for PC's in general. If your XBox360 is hacked in some way, it probably could be used to play PS1 games...though honestly most emulators don't support force feedback for DualShock controllers. It does vibrate quite well when the drivers are installed and when you are playing a PC game that supports force feedback.
can i plug in the original play station 4 way multi tap and that way i can play 4 controllers on one plug?
I'm not certain, but I don't see why that wouldn't work. I'd be very surprised if it didn't. Edit: Okay, I looked into this for you, and now I don't think it will. Apparently, PS1 multitaps do not work when used on a PS2. Since this device is for connecting PS2 controllers, chances are it wouldn't work. I bet a PS2 multitap would work just fine, though.
Does it use 2.0 USB or 3.0 USB ports?
It works great with wired gamepads on my USB 2.0 systems.
Does this work with Windows 7? I might as well ask if it works with Windows 8 although I am not a user of that operating system.
Yes, works with win7, I haven't tested it with win8. But i would think it works fine. Its plug and play.
Does it work for the PS2 Slim? My controller ports don't work, Would it work to plug in my controllers using this device instead of the standard port?
I tried it on my ps2 (fat)and it does not work so i doubt itll work for the slimon the other hand thank you i,you gave me a reason to whip that bad boy out
Does this work with Windows 8.1?
Yeah, I've 8.1 and it works.
When I try to launch the game I get an message that says to insert the original game disc. That is what I believe I have done. I have Win 8&amp; 4 discs ?
If I remember correctly, it needs an update before it will work - check Google for a better answer.
Is the "Enhanced" physical copy the same as the download " Enhanced directors cut" version?
Yes, they are the same thing. If not it would update for free to be the same, but if I remember right, when I bought it it was all up to date. It's totally worth the buy imo
Will it run on Windows 7 ?? I keep getting minimum requirements not met.
Yes it will l. I'm running the game a PC with an AMD phenom x3 2.8 processor and a Radeon HD 6450 video card with max settings. Runs great.
Will this run okay on a Lenovo/Windows 8 Asus? Do I have to do anything for my laptop in order to make it work? Or can I just play?
You're gpu would be the main facter in performence, but you should be fine. I run Windows 8 and there are no problems for me
at launch game. box pops saying I must be administrator to play first time. I am the administrator. Any help would be appreciated I am running windows 8
Even if you are administrator, try right clicking on the game and choosing "run as administrator". You may also have to run it in a compatibility mode for Windows 8. I have Windows 7, so I'm not sure:/
does this have a control option to adapt to a 'windows' xbox controller?
I don't believe so, as it was only released on PC. The controls are super funky, so I'm not sure how it could be mapped to a 360 controller...
will this work with windows 7
Yes. I ran it on Windows 7 with no problems.
What is included in the box? Just DVDs? Thank you.
You get a full sized map of The Northern Kingdoms, a 2 page installation guide, a 48 page insert from The Witcher novel by Andrzej Sapkowski, a 112 page strategy guide, a physical soundtrack on CD and another CD with music inspired by the game, the actual game disc, a bonus disc, and a behind the scenes disc. You'll need to download the Director's Cut patch once you install the game to get all the censored content they cut out of this version.
I have a HP notebook that has the processor AMD A8-6410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics 2.00 GHZ. Will this game run smoothly on my laptop?
Yes, I think it will
Hi, is this the larger boxed dvd version with mutiple disks, a printed manual, game guide and a map?
Yes. But be sure your computer has the proper Windows. It will not operate on my windows 7.
Is there any lag input?
No lag at all that we can tell, I'm a gamer with consoles and computers. My son is Autistic and wants everything fast paced so if there is even a suggestion of an issue we'd have problems. Smash Bros is fast and on going, I'd say no issues at all. Hope this helps.
How long is each extension?
6ft
Can you combine two (2) extension cables?
Yes! You can combine all four if your heart desires! Just make sure they're secured together tightly so that they don't fall out, and play gamecube from where ever you want.
Do these cables work with the Wii U (with the 4-port Mayflash adaptor) for Smash Bros? Please be specific, Thank you.
We bought the Smash Brother bundle that included the adapter for the Wii U and it works great! Don't see a difference that adapter or just playing straight from the Gamecube. The cables work well with Gamecube controllers And the new Smash controller.
Does this allow for gamecube controllers to work with the Wii U for the new Smash Brothers?
No
$ 7.99 is the price for each extension? or for the package of four extensions? Please clarify
It is the cost for the four pack. Got them and they work great.
which wii has gamecube controller connections
Most Wii's have Gamecube ports on top, under a plastic door. Only the last 2 editions, the Mini and the Family edition(the one designed to lay flat) don't have them. Google for photos of theses two if needed...
where do the gamecube controllers connect to the wii
There is a hinged cover on the top when the wii is in the stand.
compatible with windows 8?
Yes
i would like to know why i can*t play my games because i dont have cd-key code
The CD codes are to insure that you are the actual purchaser of the program and not someone who got the program through some other means, ie an illegal back market copy.
Does this work with Windows 7?
yes it dose work on windows 7
does the pc version have the zombie levels? thanks
Yes it does.
Does this have single player mode ?
Yes
If I buy the physical copy of the game will that redeem on steam?
No it won't; you would have to buy the Steam version. I bought the DVD version on purpose though just so I wouldn't be dependent on Steam (I do that with any game that is actually available on actual media).
can i play this on a standard windows vista?
Yes, actualy the logo on the game disk is the Windows vista logo.
Can u play with people from steam ?
You should be able to just add game in steam
Can u play modded zombie maps ?
Yes.
does it already have all the update patches
The Game is up to date
I have a Netbook without internal DVD player. Do you need to have the DVD on the system (external) to play it?
Did you buy a physical "DVD" game or did you by a download game? I have the physical DVD game and I do not need to use the disc (after initial installation) to play the game. I purchased it this way intentionally because some of the online downloaded games have to be run through an online server like Steam and there fore can only be played while you are on line (WIFI connected) and I use my laptop while traveling and seldom have a WIFI connection. Since you don't have an internal DVD player your options would be to buy an external USB player (they can be very inexpensive, from 19.99 up) to download a physical DVD of the game or buy an on line downloadable version.
Has anyone installed an played this in Windows 8?
Yes works well
Will the disc copy be able to activate through steam with a product code or by other means?
There is no code. You literally just pop the disc in and install. However, any saves made with the steam version are compatible. I played the steam demo of torchlight, and then deleted the demo. The installer found the remaining nested directory within the steam folder and installed it there, allowing me to pick up where my character originally left off. Personally, I prefer a steam-free experience when possible. You can always add a link to this version through the add feature in steam client. However, you cannot add this version to your steam account.
Is this Mac and PC? Is this a Mac and PC version or do I have to look somewhere else for the Mac version?
Torchlight Mac SB for mac specific version and Torchlight JV Hybrid for a hybrid version
Cutsie graphics going away anytime soon? idk why all games today go the anime direction?
Bud, it can't ALL be filtered, near-colorless pallets of gore and grime. Cheer up, I'm sure there'll be more of the same old kind of hack-slash soon that you personally prefer. Not every game is made to please every person, move along, apparently there's nothing here for you--there might be for someone else though.
Is Torchlight compatible with Windows 8?
I don't know if it is. I have windows 7 which it works wonderful. You could look at the specs on the back of the game on the amazon web site to see for sure.
Is Torchlight made for any other game console, or just PC?
All games have the platforms they are designed for plainly visible on their covers. Some might say Mac and PC some just PC. X-box and other console systems have their own unique platforms and manufacturers will specify those that will play another's platform in their instructions. The Torchlight game I purchased and is pictured here is for PC only.
is this compatable with the xbox 360?
if you got a 360 you could probably see if they got a version through through xbox live and download it.
Do these headphones put out 5.1 surround?
They are stereo headphones. Your sound card probably has something that simulates surround. Mine does. Very good headphones.
can someone please confirm whether or not this comes with the usb sound card adapter? it's 350 vs 399 from another amazon post. why?
I just received this headset without the usb sound card adapter, so guessing this listing does not include it.
Hey guys got a question and hoping someone can help me out as I live in Japan. http://www.amazon.co.jp/&#x3010;&#x56FD;&#x5185;&#x6B63;&#x898F;&#x54C1;&#x3011;beyerd... The above Beyers are all I can get in Japan and was just wondering if this color difference is because this one is an older model,...
I didn't know there was a color difference. I purchased the ones pictured and they are awesome
Is there an inline mute for the mic?
If you're using the USB, yes. If you're using the headphone jack on your computer for them, no.
Is this headset worth the money ? as all the reviews i been seeing is it the best headset ? ill be using it for PC with ASUS Xonar Essence Stx?
For flat and accurate sound it's up with the best. It's not the most ideal for bassy music but it will hit all the notes. The Xonar is good, these are only 32 ohm and can be powered by most sources.
this or beyerdynamic dt 880? why?
The DT 880 doesn't have a mic, so if you have a decent external one, you should be covered. But personally I always prefer a full set. Their prices are almost the same, so I think you should go with gaming, IF you will use it as gaming headset.
Do these headphones offer sidetone? That is, can you hear your own voice through the mic?
You can always set that option through playback devices in Windows. Just right click on the mic device in playback and choose listen to.
Does this headset come with the USB Dac and also does it have Mic Monitoring?
No and no. These headphones only have standard audio jack connectors (3.5mm plug with a 1/4" adapter). All the "smarts", if any, will come from whatever this is plugged in to.
is there a better gaming headphone than this? or this is top of the line?
I've owned about 5 headsets in the last 2 years. This has been the best headset I've found on the market when it comes to sound and mic quality. It does lack features like mic mute when boom is up and on can volume controls.
can this hook up to ps3? ps4? i have a monitor with headphone jack, that works?
These will work with anything that outputs through a standard headphone jack. That being said, these headphones sound best when used with a decent amplifier. Using just a headphone jack will allow for sound in your ears but the mic will require a dedicated mic jack in addition to the headphone jack to use the microphone.
Is this software work well with Windows 7? Based on reviews, it didn't seem like it.
It works well with my Windows 7. My kids love to play it, and haven't had any problems with it so far.
Will This Game Work On Windows 8.1?
Yes I have Windows 8 also it works fine
Does this work with a 3 year old, HP laptop?
Yes
Do you need Internet access to play this game?
Our grandkids usually play it on a computer NOT connected to the Internet and it works just fine. However, having Internet access is helpful for upgrades.

They are in one bundle (2 discs if I am not mistaken).
Does this work with a new windows 8 computer? Would like to know before i buy it.
Yeah it works great on windows 8
Is this a digital download or a disk download?
Disc
Can anyone tell me how many discs are included in this collection?
All 3 it is the full collection! There are so many options you won't know where to start!
Is there a way to play this without a disc drive without buying an external one?
No
Does it work for a Mac computer?
We had a Dell and HP at the time. It should say it in the system requirements, etc. that they give. I don't like too many computer games but this one had lots of positive aspects and our boys really enjoyed.
Is the 60 GB xbox a Jasper Chipset?

Yes
Does this game run on Linux?
i googled that question and there is a site that says it can be done with linux that reads as follows: There is a lot of good information to installing and configuring CoD4: Modern Warfare here on WineHQ: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Most of the Tests are Platinum, so it should install and run just fine. It seems versions 1.4 thru 1.6 are the Platinum but version 1.7 may have some problems.
Does this download need internet access to play? and is it compatible with an intel hd graphics chip?
NO AND NO
Does this play on "Window's Vista 32 Bit"?
I don't know why it wouldn't. I played it on a Win7 machine, and it was made for machines older than Vista. Either way, you should be ok, as long as your video card meets or exceeds the recommended requirements.
Does it include online playing?
YES

This console is not backwards compatible, in fact the only PS3 that ever was, was one of the first units made, a 60Gig unit. It was only backwards compatible compatible with PS2. I had one of those for years, it finally died when a visiting dog decided to urinate on it! All PS3s have build in wifi and hdmi output.
does it last long
I've had mine since 2008 and it still works fine.
will ps2 games play in ps3 80g
No
does it play ps2 games
No
is it in english
Yes, the version i played is
Can you detach the throttle but still use it? Say if I wanted to mount the throttle on the left arm of my chair, and the flight stick on the right?
The two detach, and the throttle can still be used, but I don't think the connective wire is long enough to span between two arms of a chair. Maybe a foot, foot and a half tops.
Would this work on Star Citizen alpha?
Yes, it works, but last I tested it was mapped a little strangely by default.
how does this stick work playing elite dangerous? any suggestions if this one isnt very good for the game?
Works great and I love it. For those that are wishing for more hat switches you can use the three thumb buttons on the throttle as modifiers (similar to shift, ctrl or alt) to the main stick buttons in controller setup. This multiplies the buttons on the main stick: You essentially have 4 hats, 4 triggers, and 4x2 thumb buttons on the main stick. I just assign each throttle button to a ship function- like #1 = defensive countermeasures, #2 = navigating/docking operations, #3 = utility (i.e. deploy cargo scoop, silent running, etc.) and I have more than enough capability with this setup. Another nice feature that compliments the game is the middle detent in the throttle that allows you to easily locate zero-throttle versus reverse throttle. Highly recommend for Elite:Dangerous.
How long is the USB cord?
From using a tape measure, I came up with 102 inches or 8 ft. 5 inches.
Does this have yaw control? As in, can you twist the stick clockwise/counterclockwise?
In short, yes. Long answer: There are two options for yaw control. The stick has twist functionality for yaw. For a second option, there is a two way rocker/lever bar behind the throttle assembly (where the tips of your fingers rest).
does the Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X Flight Stick by Thrustmaster work on all flight simulators games for macs
I cannot say if it works on all of them but every game I have used it on for both mac and pc it worked great.
Anyone have experience using it in Warthunder and/or Aces High? Does it work with either of them?
It works for both of them great! Fully compatible!
Does the throttle work with the GOG-released X-Wing Special Edition that includes the 1998 CD-ROM version?
Yes it does, but only on the 1998 one. I have only played around with it for 30 minutes or so, but out-of-the-box, the joystick can control the trigger, select object in reticule, select nearest starfighter. The throttle sets the speed but not on a gradient; it's full on, 2/3, 1/3, and 0. There are buttons that set each of these too. I don't think there was anything else. The 1993 game has fewer working controls: just steer, fire, roll, and select object in reticule. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to customize the calibration.
Does it work with Windows 8 and 8.1?
It does, indeed. I got it for my PC that runs Windows 8.1, and it works great!
Does the stick have twist motion for yaw?
Yes and yes. The Joystick twists AND the throttle has a rocker bar (you can't see in this photo) for rudder control on the back. Both snap back to default when not actually twisting/rocking.

I'm Not a Big Wiz-Kid on This Stuff, but My PS3 is a CECH-2001B Model. Will This Cooling Fan Fit My PS3, Properly? Will It Run Any Different?
I honestly wouldnt recommend buying, made no difference in my opinion
it can help ps3 prevent to get YLOD on 60 GB?
Yeah, the less heat the better for the system. Having the fan boosts the chances of extending your PS3's life by at least 3 years depending on how often you use it.
does this fan fit the 60 gig ps3 or the 40 gig ?
I have the 40 and it fits
How loud is it? only reason i'm looking at this because the current built in fan of my ps3 is too loud for my taste
It is not loud .. but it did not prevent my PS3 from overheating .. it might work for you ..
does this work with the ps3 fat boy also does actually works there are so many mix reviews about this product
Not sure about fat boy but mine seems to work good
I have the 2nd/3rd gen. "fat ps3" my cable ports are spread out on the back of the ps3, how high is this fan connected to the PS3 in the back?
It covers the back of the PS3 completely and is flush with the system. Doesn't really work though as it actually caused my PS3 to overheat faster.
Isa this fsx gold + Accleration pack?
FSX Gold includes 1. FSX Deluxe + SP1 & SP2 2. FSX Acceleration Pack 3. If interested in SDK the last disk also includes the SDK service packs (2). You do not need the gold version to run on win 7 or win 8! It is only a packed version of everything + service packs. This FSX is the same as when it first came out, it has NOT been updated! Note: you cannot run acceleration with the standard version of FSX
Can you make your own missions? Can you get unlimited fuel?
Yes
Will this run okay on Windows 7 with a 32 bit system?
Yes this will run perfectly well on a Windows 7 32-bit system.
will this program work on Windows 8.1?
it should. The game worked pretty well on my windows 8.
I have never played a flight simulator game before, and i am not a pilot. Could i still learn to play this game?
Yes of course you could there is a full tutorial all the way up an airline pilot. To get the best out of the sim take time to read the 'how to ' e.g. GPS and auto pilot etc. it's well worth it.
How realistic is this game? Would hours of playtime = the ability to(in an emergency situation) fly a plane crapily and live to tell the tale?
I like it and it makes me think I could fly a big plane if necessary. Maybe just my ego though. I have flown a couple of small plane but never pursued my pilots license. I think it is realistic.
will this work on windows 8.1?
Works well with windows 8.1.
Does it work with windows 7?
Yes, I've installed it on Windows 7, 64 bit OS and it's working
work with windows 8.1?
I'm using 8.1 myself and I have not encounter any issues.
How come these are so expensive when you can get FSX Steam for $4.99 on Steam
Hi, The Steam needs an internet download of upto 15 gb's. Regards
Has anyone tried dance mats with this? I know the description calls them out, but was wondering if anyone had experience.
Yes
Why are both my PS2 controllers buttons being pressed automatically and when i do press any button none of them work?! ps1 works fine its just the ps2
I've never had that issue. Mine works great with both of my dual shock 2 controllers. It could be that they aren't true sony controllers, or that a button has been configured to be automatically activated. try reconfiguring the buttons and if that fails reinstall the drivers. If that doesn't work, your unit might be defective. also make sure your controller doesn't have stuck buttons inside, I had that happen once, had to take it apart and clean it with windex and cotton swabs.
Does this also support ps1/psx controlers?
You bet.
According to the May Flash website under the support/driver download sections it says it supports windows 8 as well
Yeah this does work with windows 8.1
Does this work on Windows 8?
Yes, have been using it on my laptop that is running windows 8.1 x64
Ghosting: Does anybody know if this keyboard has anti-ghosting?
I bought this keyboard even after reading some of the complaints. It's great. Some seldom used key combinations have issues. The one problematic key combination is CTL+R+any key. CTL+R does work fine though. Some use CTL to crouch in games (I use ALT) so you can see where CTL+R+W migt be an issue. http://prosperouspoverty.blogspot.com/2009/02/microsoft-sidewinder-x6-gaming-keyboard.html has a great write up on the board and addresses concerns for purchasers including the problematic key combinations. The noise about the lack of height adjusters on the back IMO is over blown since the board slopes slightly upwards. Additionally the non removable hand rest is higher than my Saitek Elcipse was so I haven't had a problem. This was my one main concern and I thought worse case I would put something under to slant it but I haven't had to.
Sidewinder X6 without the keypad: I know it is 20.2 inches (513cm) wide with the keypad attached, but how wide is it without the keypad?
roughly 41cm without the keypad
Any idea when this is coming out: Anyone?
this has been release for a couple of days now. You can purchase it now on Amazon!
Is this game backwards compatible with the 3DS?
yes, I have a 3ds XL and it works fine.
Does this version include the animated cut scenes by Akira Toriyama that were added in the PS1 re-release of the game?
Yes
Does this game have multiplayer mode?
No multiplayer. It wouldn't really make sense for this game
Does this port have all 15 alternate endings from SNES?
It is a port of the PS1 version, which should have all the endings, as well cinematic and some bonus features.
Is this the original game, but ported to DS?
Yes it is. They have some new dungeons and features you can use with the touch screen but you can shut that off.
it works on Nintendo 3ds?
It does. 3DS is backwards-compatible, and plays all Nintendo DS games.
Which languages does it have? Is Spanish included?
Unfortunately, there is no Spanish in this.
Will this US version of the game work on a European version of the 3DS?
It will for sure, but for future reference, it will not be compatable with 3ds or dsi enhancement games from other regions. Fortunately though, any plain ds game is fair game.
Is there any difference between this version of Chrono Trigger and the PS version?
Yes
How will I know I will not get one of the pirated copies?
Not really sure but it's not likely that you would be getting a pirated copy if you get it at a reliable sources or website, but if you're not sure don't take the risk just trust your gut.

How do you use the headset part, it doesn't work i can't hear anything
There is a volume scroll .scroll to the right and it should get louder if not then you might have a defective pair
will the Leatherette Ear Cushion fit this headset
Yes, it will
Will this headset break easily like some turtle beaches do
Mine broke just after a month..... looking for a better one
If you have a chatpad in your xbox controller will it still plug in to the bottom of the chatpad
My so called chatpad has not worked from the day I got it.
is it bluetooth?
No, nor is it wireless.
do you here game sound and not just other people's voices
It sounds really weird like loud and echoey
Can it be used on pc&gt;
No this is plugged directly into the bottom of the Xbox 360 controller only.
Will this fit my batman controller?
Yep all
how long does it take to deliver
Depends where you live and which speed of shipping you chose
does this have game audio
This headset is just to talk to friends and people. You can't hear the game. But, it is useful I like to chat with my friends.
Is this a good beginner simulator?My 10 yr old son has been wanting a flight sim for a long time. He obviously knows nothing about flying.Thanks!
Yeah it's a really good simulator and pretty realistic. I bought a pretty decent joystick for it too to enhance the experience. You can get one for about $20. I like using all the different plane options, and it'll also teach you patience because dinner flights last pretty long. Overall I like it a lot. You may want to take other opinions though because I don't really know much about flying or how nice other simulators are.
types of aircraft
Trike Bike, Piper Cub, Cessna, Float Planes, Twin Engine Aircraft, about seven different Jets,737,747,Airbus,Helicopters, and more than one plane in each category, it would take time to name all the planes, and there are flights to and from almost every continent in the world, it would take a long time to accomplish every thing that this simulator teaches you to do and all the cockpits and gauges are realistic to the lane you are flying. For the money the best piece of software that I bought.
how do you get GSX on here
I haven't purchased GSX or used it, but you'll have to buy it separately if you don't have it already. You should really refer to the GSX support for that, and also you can ask on the www.flightsim.com forums. Really good help there. You probably need to download the FSUIPC module and put it in your Flight Simulator X\Modules folder. FSUIPC is required for 99% of your addons, the module is free for basic use. FSUIPC: http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html
Do I need a joy stick to use it on my laptop?
No you can use the key board and mouse but a joystick makes it a lot easier. If you using windows I have all kinds of problems. iT SHUTS OFF in the middle of flights. If I knew when I purchased it I would not have wasted my money.
r there any upgrades in the last 15 yrs ?
yes. Last upgrade by Microsoft special group was 2009.
Do you have an expedited shipping option for this game?
We ship only by First Class Priority mail, which needs regular 4-10 working days to USA.
I dont know where to ask... but the activation number does not work... I am in Chile but I bought the product in the US? what can I do?
contact the seller in your account information under orders.
Is this compatible with Windows 8?
I have Window 8 and have no problem installing the game.
So does this play KOTOR and all the other original xbox games?
So far I've no problems it playing any original xbox games
May i see a picture of the back of the console?
Hello, We are sorry but we can't (Amazon doesn't have this ability) attach pictures to general questions. We are not sure but we might be able to send a picture if you use "Ask the Seller Question"?? Sorry for the trouble.
I need a new power brick for my original XBOX. Does ANYONE know where I can buy one? I've been looking for days.
Find a Game Exchange i.e. "Game X-Change," They specialize in restoring retro systems and selling retro parts/games/consoles. I'm sure you could even log on to a game x-change website and find what ya need man, believe me there's a huge market out there for retro systems and retro game play.
Hi! i'm in Ireland but I'm going back to Brazil soon. Can you tell me whether this console is 110v or 220v?
110 thanks for your question Mj
where the adapter needed for internet
its a basic internet cable in the back of the console that connects to an Ethernet device. there is no wireless adapter. please remember that Microsoft mo longer supports online gaming for this device so you will need to connect it to another service. like Kai. (an Xbox LAN connector powered by your PC)
Can you buy games for this model today?
Yeah you can you can buy some on amazon and other places lukie is also a good place for old games thats were i get all my old games
Does it still work today after its been out for 13 years with it was 2001. I'm thinking about getting but, I'm not 100% sure if I should get on.
It still works but there is no longer support for online gaming.
dose this cum with controlers n cords n game for the price
No
Does XBOX Console works out of U.S.?
If you have the proper power adapter or correct cable in respect to your region or country, it should work!
does it come with controllers?
No it did not come with controllers, just the console.
Anyone play FFXIV with this?
Yes
Will this work in games from PSN? Specifically rpg maker 3 from ps2 classics
For me it worked in Battlefield 4 in the search menu. The touch pad didn't work though.
Does anybody use this with a Raspberry Pi 2 // RetroPie?
Yes. It works fine. Only drawback is that it is on top of the remote and not the bottom where the PS4 is now on the bottom. It works fine.
Considering it is Blutooth, can i use it for my tablet that has blutooth or an iphone
I never tried pairing it with other blutooth device, but I believe it could be done.. at least I paired a blutooth earphone from third party to my PS3, so I guess there would have no problem!!
Will this keyboard work with PS2 games (I have an E01 and B01 and play FFXI on it using the PS2 support)?
No. Sorry, Just double checked with my PS2. That controller is too small to accomodate, configured differently and is not wireless.
Does the keys light up in the dark. If it doesnt how do u know what you're pressing when its dark
The key does not light up, there are 3 or 4 small lights around the edges, but those only tell you either it's charging or its on. You cannot see the buttons in the dark. Like any key pad, you will get use to where the buttons are over time but this pad is not really made to have long conversations, it's best utilized for short messages. I had my doubts when I first brought it, but for me it was a good investment.
Does the PS3 wireless keypad work on the PS4? I am looking for a chatting solution for Final Fantasy XIV.
I have read in an official sony Ps3 forum that yes, it works but there are some buttons that doesn't work with ps4 only on ps3. But the letters works fine as far i can read... Pd: i don't have a ps4 yet! Pd: sorry for my bad english!
A FAT PS3 (e.g. A01, B01, E01) is able to run via hardware/software emulation legacy games (such as PS1 and PS2 games). Many of these legacy games use a keyboard (e.g. Final Fantasy XI for the PS2). Will this keyboard work with legacy games (e.g. PS1,...
Sorry. It's design is quite limited. Check with PS3 support. Maybe there's a way around it.
Does it work with PS3?
No. Only for PC MASTER RACE
dos it have twist action for rudder ,thank you
Yes it does.
Dose it work with microsoft flight simulater X
Yes it is fully compatible with FSX. I am running it with FSX on Windows 8.1 with no issues.
Does the stick have yaw control too?
Yes
Will this joystick work with Windows XP?
I have not tried it, but per the manufacturer and the OEM packaging it is compatible with XP/Vista/7. I am running 8.1 and it works as expected.
does it feature force feedback?
No it does not have force feedback
it works with windows 8.1 usb 3 and prepar3d? it have rudder movements?
Rudder control is by twisting the stick left or right.
WIll this Joystick work with Battlefield 3 and 4? (Windows 7)
Yes it will. You have to clear all the default joystick setting tho in the game. It's pretty straight forward. However, Ive noticed that in BF4 there is a button or two that seems to be bugged. I use the two buttons in front of the throttle to afterburner, and it keeps opening up a damn menu. In all honesty, it works wonders in BF3... But worst in BF4, They seem to have optimized it mainly for the game pad and mouse/keyboard... At least when flying a heli. "i'm not much of a jet guy."
How is the deadzone for FSX? (deadzone is the region that the joystick can physically move without registering any change)
its very responsive, once u move it, it moves your aircraft...hope this helps :)
does it work for elite dangerous
Kind of. I really haven't played it in sometime. I would search more on YouTube on it
Is this compatible with an X52 system? I mainly use it for Elite Dangerous
Yes as your X52 is an integrated flight stick system. Consisting of a throttle and a stick similar to a fighter jet set up in theory. This will add more to it as it also is Saitek and it allows functions not capable of the X52. This will be a nice addition to your setup.
If i wanted to use this to control something on another game besides FS, Could i use a program similar to "Xpadder" to map the controls?
All of Saitek's products are programmable and therefore can be modified in simulators such as FSX etc. I am not familiar with your simulator or program but I am sure that you can obtain the map of the buttons and knobs and therefore change their functionality.
Is this compatible with a Macbook Pro?
Yes but you have to visit saitek.com downloads for the mac drivers.
Is it as complex as the picture?
It's hard to be sure what you mean. Complexity of Setup: Easy...just a USB plug. Complexity of Panel Switches: Not at All. It's a decent-looking panel, but has a "lightweight" feel, which could be good for some, bad for others. Be aware, though, (since I wasn't), that this panel is only compatible with FSX, and possibly Prepar3d.
Does it work with X-Plane 10?
The Saitek Pro Flight Switch Panel and other Saitek Panels using the Saitek drivers work only with Microsoft products, but if you go to x-plane.org you can download a driver that will do the job. You will have to switch each panel during the X-Plane boot up to get the program to recognize that the Saitek Panels are on and available. All functions seem to work.
Has anyone else had problems with the start engine knob? Engines turn over and stop, but never start. I've tried everything that I can think of, including the suggested different driver and the fuel mixture setting. Going online I see people had this...
Yes, If you have it off before you start xplane (This is what I use) and then try to turn it on, it won't. You will need to reset the game or move you plane via the map to a different location. Before the computer screen loads, you will need to switch it back to Start then BOTH. Hope This helps.
Is this product compatable with windows 8
Yes there are drivers available for Win7 and Win8 for both 32bit and 64bit systems.
X Plane 10 compatible? Without downlaoding any drivers and things. Look Im a rookie and i just want to plug it in set my controls and fly in xlpane 1l
Its a computer attachment si yes it should work no problem specially if you have win7 and up where driver updates are automatic.
Will this work with FS2004?
I am not sure!, you can go to their site to find out " http://www.saitek.com/ ", take care!!
Does this connect with USB?
Yes. Be warned, though, that's is only compatible with Microsoft FSX. The driver software does not allow for custom programming, it has a plugin that automatically loads with FSX.
Does this work with a Mackbook pro?
This does *not* work with a MacBook Pro. I ordered one for my Mac without realizing the input jack on the laptop is line-level. The mic-level output is insufficient meaning no sound can be heard when speaking (although the headset *can* be used for listening). The Mac requires a USB or Bluetooth headset.
plus vs standard
standard : regular sized headset, small, no adjustable / reaching mic, not padded in most cases, sound quality plus: padded, a little more comfortable, nice size mic, medium size headset, reasonably priced (depending on where its purchased)
Does it work with a ps3? Does this work with a ps3?
I've used mine with my PS3 via a USB adapter. Works fine, but the cord is a bit short.
does it work with ps3
Regrets, but I cannot help there ... I bought it for PC/Skype, not gaming. All it is is basically a set of speakers (headphones) and a microphone, so I'd imagine it would work with your game system, but it won't do anything like vibrate or whatever game-specific headgear might do.
do they work with a playstation 3
yeah, but you need a adapter
does ot work with PS3
I am not sure? I use mine for my desktop PC and my laptop. Still works great :)
Does it work with ps3
It has 3.5 mm jacks for the mic and ear phones. I don't have a ps3 but I use it for PC
Can you make this compatible with a ps3?
I don't know if you would be able to use the microphone but there are all types of adapters that convert the pink and green jacks into various devices. Just type in "pc to ps3 headset adapters" and find one that you think will work for you.
are these headsets adjustable and suitable for an 8yr old for 360 xbox live
Yes, the headphones are adjustable. I've noticed that some reviews said that they weren't. Not true. Is it suitable for an 8 year old? I don't see why not. The 'phones are comfortable and well padded, which helps block outside noise. They also have a volume control and a mute button, which is good when your dad yells, "Turn that dang thing off"! The mic is on an adjustable boom which can be pulled close or moved out of the way completely. That's what I do when I use them as studio headphones, which as I stated in my review, are surprisingly good. Now, for the last part of the question- I have no idea how an "Xbox Live" works. These headphones have the standard green, (for headphone), and pink, (for mic), plugs which mate with a computer. However I'm sure that there are suitable adapters. I use a mini to 1/4" adapter to use them on my mixer. I hope this helps. Like I said, for the price they can"t be beat.
Is this headset compatible with Xbox 360?
Yes. As long as you have a 3.5mm jack to connect this headset's own 3.5mm jack, than it will work great.
Are the dimensions above correct ? 29x18x13 inches seem very big.
I measured mine, about 14" front to back on the yoke and stem shaft. 12" side to side, and about 8" high.
does it roll 90 degrees?
No
Item lists: "two traditional push buttons on the back of each grip" - but no picture. Are they suitable for constant use(shooting/dog fighting)?
yes I have done it you can assign any of the buttons whatever task you'd like it to do- but for my use now I strictly use the Yoke for flying commercial type flights or just general aircraft. In my opinion I would have a stick type joystick if you are going to do allot of combat flying, I have a stick type also for when I get that itch. but this yoke really does put some realism into your flying hope that helps
my brother has had this yoke for a few years and it has worked fine. recently it has begun "pullling" the plane to the left. any ideas?
Other than re-calibrating/centering - sorry no.
Has anyone tried it with Windows 8? Does it work like in Windows 7?
Yes, it works with windows 8.
Do the mixture and prop controls work properly?
Yes. Both work on an axis just like the throttle. If you watch the lower cockpit, you can see the aircraft controls move in response.
Can it be used on gefs-online on a mac?
Sorry I don't know on the Mac I use mine on a PC . if had it to do over again I'd get the regular CH yoke and buy the rudder peddels separate. But you can go to the CH website and check for compatibly with the Mac

This will work if I have one Mexican account? the digital code does not work that way, but I'm not sure if the pre paid will work
No, this will only work if you have an account on the US playstation store, your physical geographic location does not matter.
I have my ps3 registered for CHile (latinamerica)and I am not pretty sure if I can still use this , I am living in costarica,
My son is the one who use card as my christmas gift so i will ask him but its only the Registration is the difference but the manufacturer is still the same it may still be working. What you can do ask some info around in there. It will a lot compare i live in canada so don't have much idea about it.
Is there any difference between "Playstation Network Prepaid Game Card" versus a "PlayStation Store Gift Card"? Is the PSN card just the old version?
the only difference I see is the price, it costs 57 black and blue 49.99
Will this work with playstation 4
According to the official playstation website: http://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstationnetwork/playstation-store/ , all PSN cards should work on the PS4, PS3 and PSN.
delivery is online, for email?
No, delivery is through the postal system. It is a physical card with a code on it. The picture is an actual picture of the card.
May I use it in Guatemala?
Yes, you can use it anywhere in the world, however only on the US playstation store.
may i use it in costarica
Yes, is the better (almost the only) way!
This works for the ps4?
Yes yes it does. The PSN es network agnostic so funds will be seen by your account and all the devices registered to it.
Does this card work for ps4?
I would think that all psn cards work on all operational gaming systems
Is there a risk of over charging the batteries and shortening their lifespan?
No, this charger stops when the controls is completly chargeds
Does it come with the chargable batterypack for the controller ?
This is only for PS3 controllers. They don't come with battery packs. All you have to do is push the controller into the slot and it charges. It's really easy.
An odd reply for this question below so I'll ask it again: Can I put a PS3 and a PS4 controller on this charger?
No. PS3 is Mini USB (This product) PS4 is Micro USB. Completely different cables. Even if the notches of the charger line up it won't physically fit.
Does this come with multi-voltage support?
Yes, its support both voltage.
hi. is it only 110v? or does it support both 110v - 220v? thanks!
It's Bivolt. 110-240V
Do you have to plug this into the PS3 or can you use a wall outlet to charge the remotes with this?
It has an AC adapter and doesn't require the console to charge the controls.
can a ps3 charging station charge dead controllers?
Yes
Dear All... I will love to buy this product, but I have a question, Could I use this product with the silicon protector placed on the controller?
I wouldn't recommend it. Because it could be fire-hazard, or treat it as one , just to be on the safe side. &#128549;
Should I unplug this after my controllers are fully charged or just let the green light sit?I don't use my ps3 often so it kinda seems like a waist?
I take them off once charged. Probably not good to have a constant charge going in.
is there a plug to plug into an outlit
Yes
Will it run on windows 8?
Yes it runs in Windows 8, the newer version of Hoyle is not as user friendly, so I like the old version better.
will it work with Windows 8.1
yes, I had no trouble downloading onto mine Windows 8
Do you have to have the CD inserted to play the games after installation?
No, my husband downloaded the cd, put an icon on the front screen and all I have to do is click on the icon. The game menu comes up and I can select the game I want to play. Really cool!!
does it have canfiedl and hearts
Yes there is Hearts,but I don't see Canfield.
Will it work on Windows 7?
yes very well.
DOES IT HAVE CARD GAME MEMORY MATCH
Yes
I have the 2005 version but it does not have SPIDER,a solitaire game..does this version have it. Thanks
Yes, it does, and many, many other variations.
Does this game have gin rummy included?
Yes, "Gin" and also "Rummy 500" are listed in the contents. Have fun! This is an excellent program.
Does it have tournaments?
While this lists quite a number of card games, I see no sign that it has the capacity for tournament play.
Is Canasta included in this version?
yes I love to play it too

Anyone know what firmware comes pre-installed on this?
6.60
Does this item have a Headphone Jack?....and if so, what size is the Jack? Also does this item have built in speakers?
The psp 3000 has a 3.5mm headphone jack according to various websites (i can honestly stick in most of my normal headphones/earbuds) The PSP 3000 does have built in speakers. Also note that I believe the psp 3000 does not have internal memory so you will need a memory stick for your files.
this have camera?
No, it does not include a camera. However this model is compatible with the (separately sold) psp camera
Does this come with a memory stick?
it dose not come with a memory stick but you can get one on amazon for a good price I love my psp
will it work in the UK
Yes it will
does this plug into ps3 console?
Yes, the PSP will plug into a PS3. It uses the same mini-usb cable the PS3 controllers use. There is not a whole lot you can do with it other than transferring games, however remote play is still possible with a select list of supported games.
Can you play old PSP-1001 games on PSP-3000 system?
Yes its still the same standard UMD (game discs)
Can u play PS VITA games on this because I don't See any other games that come with this HELP
I am afraid not. This is a separate console compared to the PS Vita. Think of this as the PS2, and the Vita is the PS3. Now as for the, not seeing games that come with this, this is just a specific model of PSP, any game labeled as a PSP game will work on this console, just as any game labeled as PS Vita will only work on the Vita. Hope this helps.
Why does it say "Discontinued by manufacturer: Yes"
The PSP was discontinued by Sony in 2012 and replaced with the PSVita. New games on the UMD's are no longer being released either; however, the PSP is still supported by the PlayStation Network as far as I know and there are plenty of great games floating around on amazon for the PSP.
Can you download digital ps vita games on the psp 3000?
No beacuse the psp vita games have a higher graphic engine and it will not support it on the psp 3000
Can I download this to my ipad?
I would think so. I download to my kindle. It s a playrix game and on Amazon you can get it for your Ipad. Have fun with it. Love the game

DRM? Hi, Does anyone know what DRM this compilation contains?
I have read a post elsewhere that said it doesn't have Starforce at least on The Two Thrones, for the current $9, I'll buy this since I have been holding off on the third game because of it. Can post again once I install it and check for myself... EDIT: The game came up clean after doing a scan with ProtectionID. Unless it's hiding deep in the game, it's good! In fact, all three discs came up clean.
Two Thrones Uncensored? Anyway, is there a fix?
I bought this at the NEX (Navy Exchange) almost a year back, and didn't notice any censoring.. decapitations were definitely abundant..
Does this work on Windows 7/8/8.1?
Last machine I ran it on was a win7 republic of gamers laptop. It had to run in compatability mode, but I was able to play it (with minimal hicups, but some graphical degradation) I was using a beefy spec rig though, your mileage may vary. I havent tested it on windows 8/8.1
is it an rpg
Yes
gamepad support? Does anyone know if this is the case with the versions included in this set, or has Ubi Soft added support for these releases?
I got past the lack of gamepad support on the first game by using a gamepad/keyboard mapper, Pinnacle Game Profiler in my case. However, there was a free one entitled Xpadder, though I am not sure if it is still free... It will allow mapping of a controller's buttons using the keyboard keys the game uses. Also, I didn't need one for Warrior Within since the game itself can map most gamepads I hear and had no problem using my XBOX 360 controller after setting it up myself. While I haven't played The Two Thrones yet, I am sure it's the same for that one too. Just Google the two programs listed above and you'll be fine I think! :)
What is the difference between the Old Version and New Version?
I guess its better graghics, I think the old version was DOS based and the new version is windows based, unless I am showing my age and there was another version between the DOS based and Windows based games.
Will this joy stick work with Microsoft flight sim. X ?
Yes! Flawlessly.
This doubles as a generic usb gamepad for action games? Or it's intended exclusively for flight control?
It comes with programmable software installed on the joystick itself, so you can custom program each and every button to do whatever you want. So while it is geared towards flight control, I'm sure you can get it to do much more on other games.
Can this stick be used left-handed?
It's perfectly semetrical in every aspect, it could be used with either hand.
Can the functions be re-mapped? Thinking about this for a duel stick Star Citizen setup.
Yes
Is this stick durable? Can it tolerate stressful actions like, trigger pulls under duress or a high anxiety turn?
I haven't had any trouble and no signs of it weakening on me at all its been overall the best one I have ever had
Does it have a Yaw capability?
Yes
Does the joystick work with IL-2 Cliffs of Dover, War Thunder or Heroes and Generals?
Works well with War Thunder, that's why I got it.
will this stick work on gta games..
No
will this stick work with gta/sa
No
how well does it work with xp?...will it even recognize it?...do you need seperate drivers?
Yes it should work.
Will this wheel work with windows 7 ultimate 64 bit os?
Yes, works with all windows platforms from xp and up.
Is it possible to remove the leather cover from this wheel?
Hello, to answer your question, most guys just put a different wheel on the G27 body instead of trying to modify the existing setup. Here is a video of just one idea from Utube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHGmBHoygJA There are other ideas out there too. If you insist of taking the leather off the wheel (from my experience - And I have had a G25 for years and bought me a G27 when one of my wheel buttons began to malfunction. I have modified the shifter so I can have sequential shifting but that is all I care to do to the wheel. If you decide to take off the wheel leather, I wish you luck as it looks like it is really on there. :) -Val
Is the gas pedal realistic? I mean, in real cars, there is a big difference if you floor the gas pedal or only press a little bit.
Yes the gas pedal is realistic. I use mainly for racing but i can go around a track at 2 miles an hour or 102 or anywhere in between. for the money i recomend this wheel setup to anyone. i am sure the more expensive wheels have a better feature or two but not much better. also recomend iracing and asseto corsa for the most realistic racing experience available in my opinion, if into racing games.
Can the gears be moved to the left side of the wheel, or is it fixed on the right side?
The gear shifter is not fixed to the steering unit and can be mounted anywhere you choose to mount it.
Does this wheel turn all the way around like a real car, or is it basically just the 190 degree rotation?
It has up to 900 degress of rotation.
Does the stick shift move just like in a real car?
No it doesn't, it moves to where they are supposed to go but there is no spring that returns the stick shift to the neutral position after you take it out of gear. It kind of just sits there. In real cars the stick shift springs to center below 3rd gear and above 4th gear. This makes it so when you go from 2nd gear to 3rd gear you just have to push the stick up, instead of up, then right then up again. With the springing to center you just push it up and when it gets to neutral it springs right by itself and you just continue pushing it up to 3rd gear. (Sorry for the explanation which you probably already know, but it's for others who don't.)
has anybody tried this in ps4/? does it work
this is the answer i got for the same question I am positive that the G27 will not work in the PS4 for now because of the absence of a Sony PS4 security chip in it. Without this chip, the G27 shuts down in 8 minutes. This is how Sony protects its PS4 license. It may work in the future if Logitech manages to negotiate a deal with Sony. The 8-minute shutdown restriction can surely be circumvented by a firmware upgrade. There is actually a petition going around among G27 owners for that to happen.
What is G27 power supply voltage ratings? Is it 100-220V?
I just received my G27. It looks like the U.S. version will work in your country by just replacing the plug-in AC power cord if your outlet plugs are different from U.S. Fortunately that part plugs into the brick and should be easily replaced. The included power supply specs are: AC Input: 100 - 240Vac, 50-60 Hz, 1.0 Amp maximum DC Output: 24Vdc, 1.75 A LPS (Limited Power Source) Center = + (positive) It is a black brick design 105x47x27 mm. by APD (Asian Power Devices). It is pretty lightweight, 5.0 net wt. oz for the brick part. The output plug is a standard 2.1 mm ID (inner diameter) x 5.5 mm OD straight barrel about 12 mm long permanently attached output wire is approximately 5 feet long (about 1.7 meters). An L shaped barrel should also fit. The AC cord appears to be 6 feet (1.9 M) long with a standard non-polarized 2 flat blades without a third ground plug for U.S. outlets. The AC wire plugs into a standard looking figure 8 receptical on the brick. FYI, the most import AC adapter specs are ink stamped on the bottom of all Logitech wheel bases. I need a magnifying glass to read them. It looks like any standard laptop 24vac, 1.75 A AC adapter. P.S. I went overboard with the description because I recently discovered the adapter for my Logitech Driving Force GT disappeared during Spring cleaning. I have saved a lot of nondescript AC adapters half of which are no longer married to the original products. Logitech Customer Support blew off my request to buy a new part. They suggested buying a laptop AC adapter from a local electronics chain. I found those 24 Vac, 0.75 A. (DFGT spec, not G27), center positive adapters come in so many shapes and sizes, regulated and unregulated, long and short wires, and prices from 9.95 including shipping to US$130 plus shipping. I wish I had a detailed description of that part.
does this wheel work for consoles mainly the Xbox 360 or PS3?
Ps3 and PC only, XBOX 360 does not accept this wheel, only Microsoft branded wheels can be used on XBOX
How noisy is it? I am disabled and must race from a sort of hospital bed. There are people in the next room sleeping. (I use headphones.). Do you think it makes squeaks or clicks or whatever that would annoy them?
Turning is relatively quiet, compared to the driving force gt. If u use the manual shifter it's quite loud, shifting, but the wheel turning isn't that bad. It does make a bit of noise tho but you should be fine if the there are others in another room. My girl sleeps in the other room when I sometimes stay up l8 to play, but it doesn't bother her. I would recommend. Good luck!
will the LCD work with iTunes, or do you have to use windows media player?Is having the LCD panel worth it?
It only works with Windows Media Player. it has a small number of apps that came with it that aren't really very helpful, it looks like they went "pretty" over "Functionality" and scouring the web, pretty much all the app sites for aftermarket apps are gone now, but I DID find a program called Aida64 that can be used to create custom apps, that's all I've used since I made one for system stats. and game support for it is pretty light. google it and read the wiki on the g19 and you can see the list of games that support it. nothing terribly new so not sure if games are even trying to offer support.
Release date...???
What is the competing brand you are looking at? Does it also have an LCD?
Is there anyway to use the usb 2.0 ports to make this a wireless keyboard?
This keyboard is not wireless capable. In the gaming community, wireless is unacceptable -- time lag, etc. This keyboard needs plugging into both USB2 and electricity. It even prefers a USB port on the computer itself, not on a hub. If you want a wireless, try the Logitech K350. It doesn't have the bells and whistles of a gaming board but is excellent in all other computer functions.
Can the keys on the keyboard be set to individual colors or does the entire keyboard have to change at the same time?
Hi, unfortunately the whole set of keys will have the same colour. I figured out why individual keys are lighted so dim, it is largely due to having too small see-thru sections for the lighting to come through. Still, it is a sturdy keyboard. I am pounding on it and it is working fine. As for Mice, the corded G600 is excellent for its price. Superb Value. My hand doesn't cramp grasping it for hours on end.
For the three profiles can I use them in programs like Photoshop? Also can you display what the macros are for each profile on the screen? Thank you!
The macros are not fully compatible with every program, So i do not know. Also keep in mind that its a gaming keyboard so its made mainly for gamers. I dont think the macros display on the LED screen on the keyboard, but they do have a separate program that lets you see all your macros that you program. Honestly though, this keyboard isn't as fantastic as it sounds, the youtube app doesn't even let you browse for certain videos :/
How do you use the LCD screen? I tried using the pad on here but it does not work.
What do you mean by using it? To navigate through the different apps you use the directional pads to either side of it. As for adding, removing and configuring the apps, you need to download and install the Logitech Gaming Software.
where can I find an adapter plug to make it compatible for standard outlet
I assume that you're referring to the plug on the AC power adapter. That 2-prong AC plug fits any standard household 110 VAC power socket right out of the box... it doesn't need the 3rd (grounding) pin that you see on most AC power plugs nowadays. And, you can plug it in either way - it doesn't matter. Enjoy your keyboard.
is it mechanical keyboard?
No it's not a mechanical keyboard. If you HAVE to have a mechanical keyboard get the razor black widow. I actually returned the black widow for the g19 because my G15 gave out after 3 years, I got it used too (R.I.P), and I wanted to give the newer model of the g15 a chance.. I've never regretted it since. The display is amazing, the keys feel excellent. This is a 10/10 keyboard in my eyes. The screen tells you all the details you want to know about gaming. For instance, I play league of legends. It tells me my gold per second, current crit%, kdr etc.. its amazing. I love the volume scroll. You can play youtube off it slide shows and so much more!! Hope this helps, good luck!
Does VOIP also work with Teamspeak?
I use this headset with Vent, Teamspeak, Mumble, RazorComms and others. Not sure if that answers your question. If not, please be more specific.
Does the LCD screen display stats for dota and league?
League of Legends: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SO2MBw3P8E There is no applet for Dota, according to the forums. I don't play any of the games so I can't tell you for sure.
Does this game work on windows 8.1
While Windows 8 is not listed, it should work with Windows 8.1 I briefly tested it and it required the disk in the drive to work.
Does this Scrabble game work with Windows 7? Would rather pay outright and get the game - but am not seeing anything about Windows 7.
I bought this version (Scrabble Champion Edition Jewel case) and it works PERFECTLY for me in Win7. Save the $2-3 and buy the jewel case, we all throw away the box anyway. It's a good game too.
Can this Scrabble cd be used to play over the internet? I'd like to connect IP to IP without going through a gaming site.
Hi Roseola. Although I never tried, I checked it out for you and it looks like "no". You may play against against the clock, or take your time; play yourself (solitare), the computer (and choose from 8 levels of difficulty) or against a human (who puts in their own identity) and plays against you wherever the two of you may be. Sorry about that, but I did not see internet options. It did, however, have some interesting perks: Auto Word Validation, Pop-up Hints if requested, and a few "Best Plays" if you ever just get stumped, as well as, a Merriam-Webster Official Scrabble Dictionary built right in. Hope you find what you are looking for.
Replies indicate this edition will play on Windows 7 Home Premium. Reviews in other places indicate there are problems. What do you think?
Works OK on my windows 7.
does scrabble champion edition by encore work with windows 8.1?
YES
Does anyone know if this version will work with Windows 8?
Yes, it does. Some minor problems that I cannot fix are it plays on full screen (so horizontally enlarged) and a bit blur screen probably due to the 32/64 bit difference (not sure tho).
can I play scrabble blast with this game?
It's just Classic Scrabble; timed or untimed; play against the computer or solitaire. You can play with more players on the same computer. It has 8 levels, from Beginner to Genius. I have Windows 7 and it works fine.
will it work in windows 8?
While I don't have Windows 8 on my own computer, my husband does and he uses this game nightly so can't see why you'd have any problems.
can i download this edition
NO. It comes on a CD that has to be in the CD-player every time you play it.
Will this game work with Windows 8?
It works with Windows XP Pro, I don't see anywhere that says on the disc that it works only with specific versions, although I didn't get the box. It is a great game, & if it doesn't, u can ask Amazon to exchange it or issue you credit. It's a win-win situation.
will these work for wii u?
Yes they will
Work with nascar unleashed
It should work with any wii game that needs a steering wheel. Its not the steering wheel itself that really makes a difference it's whether or not you can turn the controller sideways and use that the way u would a steering wheel cause the controller just fits inside it. But I gotta say you don't have to worry about the controller sliding out of these steering wheels or setting loosely inside cause it is made to fit a wii controller perfectly.
I'm getting a wii mini.Will these work?
I purchased them for my Grandson and they seem to work fine for him....he is only 6. :)
Do I need wii remote plus to run wii u Mario Kart 8 for these wheels?
You can use regular Wii remotes.. Hope this helps
Will these be compatible with Mario Kart 8?
the wheels are designed to accommodate a Wii controller. the mario kart version should not have any impact on it's fit.
Can this be used with a Wii remote plus?
It can be used with a remote with the Wii plus built in, but not with one where the plus part snaps onto the bottom of the remote.
Would you check the description on item? It is for a silicone cover for an x box controller.
NO,it's plastic
Will these fit the new plus controllers I purchased with my Wii U?
Yes. I recently bought the Wii Mini w/ the remote plus included. It fits in the wheel perfectly.
We have the "Wii Remote Plus: Princess - Peach" - will these work with that model of remote, please?
I'm pretty sure it will. I think the wii remotes are all the same size.
Do you have to take the remote out of the sleeve to use the wheel?
U put the remote control in the wheel without the skin
Will it play on windows 7?
Yes!
Will it work on windows 8?
Even though the cover says it is only for XP and Vista, it runs on both Windows 7 & 8.
Does Play! have the actual games or just one-hr. trial versions with the opportunity to buy the real games?
The games are actually on the discs, they are to my knowledge the full game.
Is it only in English? I would like to get it for my mother in law, and she does not know English.
I am not sure but it does have settings for you too customize it for your own use or kids use.
What operating systems will it work on?
Windows Vista / XP Only
what are the games?
Mystery Cookbook, Alabama Smith, Treasure Masters, Heroes of Hellas, Pet Show Craze, Farm Frenzy 2, Beach Party Craze, Supermarket Mania, Fashion Craze, Jewel Quest, Mystery of the Bermuda Triangle, Natalie Brooks, others. Heroes of Hellas is my favorite. Mostly hidden object games.
is an internet connection required?
Good question! I'm always curious about things like that myself. But this game is completely written for your computer. NO internet is required to download or play, either one. And, you also have the option to custom download which games you actually want. But if you don't know what the games are, I suggest downloading them all, and going back through each menu separately, and double click 'uninstall' on the ones you don't want. No internet is required at any point.
Will it work on windows 8?
yes it does!
wil it run in window 8?
yes
will it work with windows 7?
Windows 7 is not real "game" friendly. I will work so long as you set the game to work under Win XP. But you need to change the compatibility settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.
Window XP/Vista? Would a PC game with a Windows XP symbol still work on a PC Windows Vista computer.
Hi I have recently bought a new Laptop which uses the Vista operating system. And so far have had no problems installing games. Many of the games I play are old 2005-7 and all seem to run no problems. Also newer games such as Age of Empires and Medieval Total War II are running well under Vista
Window XP/Vista? Will a PC game with an XP symbol still work on a Vista type of computer if it's still PC?
Remember that all things are backward compatible. Which means newer technology will run older programs but older technology may or may not run the newer the newer programs.
If I buy a "used" version, can I still play? Will the code be good that comes with it?
no you have to buy a new copy once the code is used it's invalid
Is GW2 Connected to GW1 in any way? Can the 2 games be combined like Prophecies and Factions?
The games are completely different, and they are relatively disconnected from one another. However, the two main connections lie with the Hall of Monuments and the back story. The Hall of Monuments was a place in Guild Wars where you could display your achievements. Based on the amount of titles and rewards one has achieved, they are awarded skins and other items unobtainable elsewhere in the game. and via this website: https://hom.guildwars2.com/en/ one could calculate the amount of awards they will be given. I hope this answers your question!
Once I install it, can I play it without having to insert the CD?
Once the game is installed, you play from the internet. You'll get weekly updates that download when you log in. There is no need to have the CD in the computer. Just be connected to the internet.
It says PC--can this be played on a Mac?
Yes, but it has some problems. It is definitely playable but it is slightly more glitchy.
does anyone know how the gameplay is in this game, my son played the first one to come out and he likes it so im wondering if this game is like it?
Yes, better graphics, but gameplay is similar.
Do you provide the code to activate the game via email? Or will I have to wait for the physical copy to arrive to get the code?
If you didn't order a download, then yes the code will arrive in the box, you will have to wait until the package is delivered to you
Physical copy? If so, can I download the game and play while the game is shipping?
If you selected the "PC" box and not the "PC Download" box underneath the "Platform" options on the page, then yes it will receive a physical copy of the game. You will need the code that comes in the box before you can play the game. You could always try the "PC Download" option if you didn't want to wait for shipping. Please note that if you select "PC Download" you will not be getting a physical copy.
will this game play on windows 8 ?
Yes! It plays well on Windows 7, 8 8.1 and even Vista.
I'm confused - what' GW1, GW2 and the deluxe versions. Can I play with GW2 or do I need other things to play?
In order to play GW2 all you need to get is either GW2 or GW2 the deluxe version. (As well as a computer, internet connection, mouse/controller, etc.) GW1 and it's expansions really are not necessary to play GW2. All it might do is unlock certain items in GW2 that you can only get from GW1(All cosmetic, and not game changing in the least). The regular version of GW2 just comes with the game: you buy the game, create an account, download it and you are good to go. The deluxe version comes with the game and a few other little things(Once again not at all game breaking or especially advantageous). TL DR: You just need the regular version of GW2 to play the game.
will it play on windows 8?
Yes
is this for European consoles or US consoles?
This is for US consoles.
help when i use this it corrupts my data and i have to format how do i use this without that happening
1. delete your file & create a new one (this usually works pretty good). 2. try using fewer codes (if you use to many codes they start to do weird things). 3. spend the extra money & invest in a gameshark (it's a much better product overall).
Can I use it to Play japan imported games on a US ps2
I couldn't even get mine to play a European copy of the movie Tank Girl staring Lori Petty. My PS2 is a US MODEL # SPCH-77001. It is a slim, soft modded, and will not play black bottom or blue bottom disc's so I can't use my GameShark to launch anything which is why I like the Action Replay Max due to it having a silver bottom which is the same for the Swap Magic, so be sure of what kind of bottoms your PS2 can play. The Action Replay is to allow you to turn your PS2 into a region 0 or region x DVD drive reader for movies and not games. So no it won't let you play your imported games. I would go with a Swap Magic if you are looking to play backups or imports on your PS2. I have Swap Magic and it allows me to play all my backups, imports, and I even have a back up of my Action Replay Max because my soft moded PS2 won't play the original but my backup copy will and it works with my backup games. You can find PS2 Swap Magic NTSC USA here on Amazon or on ps2cover.com or stoneagegamer.com who are selling it for $24.74 plus tax on ps2cover and sold out on stone age gamer, and that's without the lid for the slim ps2 if you have a fat ps2 you will need the slide tool. If you have a slim u will need the flip top cover unless you soft mod your slim like I did and then you don't need the flip top but I'm thinking of picking up the lid and buying another slim PS2 and use it on that and not soft mod it because then I can probably use my region free function and watch my import DVD's using my Action Replay MAX. "Be sure to get the NTSC U.S.A. version of swap magic if you have a U.S. PS2". The PAL version is for non North and South American PS2'S so be sure of what version you are purchasing. If u want to play backup PS1 and imported PS1 games on your PS2 I would recommend the Breaker PRO NTSC, and this can be found on ps2cover also for $19.95. I still need to buy one due to my PS2 won't read my GameShark due to it's blue bottom. I hope this helped you and also the Swap Magic NTSC version 3.8 DVD comes with some cheat codes but I haven't had any games to try them out with. When i bought my Swap Magic it stated that the DVD disc was version 3.6 but I received version 3.8 along with version 3.8 CD. I hope i was able to help you out a little bit.
where are you located?
los angeles
Does it have cheats for Dragon Quest 8???
It has some base line cheats for the main characters. However, in searching the internet, you can find proper cheats for the game, including leveling up faster, always getting an item with a monster battle, always going first. I do not like the base line cheats as they are auto maximum stats and levels for the characters, no fun at all. But, the found cheats, allowing a little help and going faster through the game without having to spend hours leveling up.. those make the game very enjoyable. Hope this helps.
Does it have star ocean till the end of time codes installed on the disc?
I don't know because I can't get it to work.
will this device work on ps2 model number SCPH - 77004?
I don't think it matters which model number the PS2 is. I have heard that it does better on the old PS2 "fat". I've had both the newer slim and the older fat consoles, and I like the older PS2 'fat" better.
Does this device work on ps2 consoles bought in india?
It might not work in India, but try see if it does work.
Does it have kingdom heart cheats?
Maybe it might not sure
Does this Come with a memory card?
No, it uses the PS2 card that comes with it.
Does this game have Steam activation?
you can buy it on steam for 29.99
will this run on win 7 32 bit
Yep. It's a 32bit program, so you shouldn't have any issues.
Will this run on W7 (64 bit)?
Yep. I have W7Pro 64bit. No issues.
can i play these with just 1 hand (the mouse)?
Yes you can. But still have the option to use letter and numbers keys and sometimes it makes it easier. For example, when you want to give someone $250, you would have to click the up arrow 250 times unless you type in "250". This is the only time I really used the keyboard rather than the mouse.
will it work with windows 8.1?
not sure - but with Window's 8 and 8.1 you have a compatibility mode that can set the Operating System that runs the game back to prior versions of Windows. And note, when I say, Operating System - it's just the environment that the game runs in, not your overall PC Operating System Environment. With Windows you can keep checking as it checks each prior version of Windows to see which one the game works on, and when it does, it will "Set" it in its memory. That way whenever you do run the game in the future, it knows what settings it needs in order to run. Good Luck.
Can i play these on a mac?
As far as I know, you can't. However, you may be able to find it on line, just make sure to look for the Mac symbol. Hope this helps, Eric

Yes

Fallout Tactics does not run, cannot find the CD. Has anyone found a real solution? Win7
I could not get it to run on win 7
do these games work on windows 8?
Yes and no. Included with the games is a copy of dosbox, a dos emulator that will run the games on windows 8. However, Fallout Tactics is unplayable unless you can find a crack that will allow you to run the game without the disc.
Is this version of fallout censored?
The games overall are not censored. Although there is an option in the pause menu that allows you to turn off the gore/blood and guts when someone dies.
Can this mouse scroll right and left?
no it cant
can it work under WIN 7? can mamba work under WIN 7?
i have windows 7 64 bit and i had issues with it. updated firware and all. Got the replacement and it did the same thing. Updated that firmware and same thing. The pointer just randomly moves on its own. It is an issue with this operating system you can google it. Tracking issue for mamba mouse. They say it could be from having stuff like hard drives running on the computer desk but not in my case just my keyboard and mouse and monitor.
How to update firmware? How to update the firmware?
You need to download the firmware then run it. You might have to resync your mouse with the base afterward.

-_- Here comes the racism.... WHO GIVES A SH**T!

What add-ons do you need to play multiplayer online?
No add-on needed to play multiplayer online although you can buy some new maps and weapons I guess.
Is this region free?
Not sure. I sold the game in less than a blink!
Will these work with the Wii U?
Yes. Any Wii controller will work with the Wii u. But it won't work with Wii motion plus games.
Does this come with two remote controllers?
It is one controller with two parts. The main rectangular controller which is used for all games and the nunchuk controller which plugs into the first controller and is used on some games.
I bought two of these remote, pink and blue, as Easter gifts for my kids. Any hints on how to get them to sync with the Wii system?
I had a very hard time. I held the sync buttons down for a while and it worked once then never would sync again. If you want your money back , contact customer service (Amazon) immediately
Does this remote have a rechargeable battery?
No
do these have the wrist straps with them?
Yes it does
will these work with the WII mini?
yes
I have noticed that generic controllers sometimes have specific charging docks that they can only be charged with... did you all need a new dock too?
No you don't need one it takes batteries.
is it user friendly?
Yes.
Do these Have Wii Motion Plus?
no they do not. they are regular controllers
Do these have the wii motion built into the remotes?
I can't speak to this but we are very happy with the controller. We use it for Skylanders, Mario Kart, and Sports Resort. It works just as effectively as the Nintendo brand one we also have, these are extras. I don't know if this helps....
- Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Nope
can u play this game without the nunchuck?
Yes! I used a gamecube controller, but there is a classic controller for the wii. You can also use the wiimote only, but I think that would be really hard xD. This remake is absolutely amazing. Definitely try it out! The GC controller is what I recommend.
do you have to use the remote and nunchuck? or can you plat this game just with the remote. no nunchuk
If you have the controller for the wii you can play this game without the nunchuck
Is the game an RPG?
Not in the traditional sense, this has no elements found in many RPGs. Other than playing the role of the (player choice) character selected from the very beginning, you play out the respective role of that S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) team member with no customization abilities.. No experience feature, no gear upgrades or crafting, no turn-based battle. This is about as far from those types of RPGs as you can get, and not considered to be one at all. It spawned a whole genre (Survival/Horror) following this game's debut.
Will this Respond to the Wii U Controller?
Yes because the Wii u console and controller are backwards compatible with Wii games.
can you play on wii u?
Should be able to since Wii U is backwards compatible but I am not positive on that since I don't have a Wii U.
Do shipped to Saudi Arabia?
no sorry i cant ship to saudi arabia
Will it play on Wii U?
Yes. WiiU has backward compatibility so that you can play your old Wii games. Just have your remote, speakers up, and let the scary fun times begin lol
I have a Wii U. Will I be able to play this game on the Wii U using the Wii U Pro Controller?
No. Unfortunately, not. Wii games can only be played on the Wii U with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers. Some of them can also be played with the Wii Classic Controller, but it depends on the game (Check the back cover). I too, have a Wii U and wish I could use my Wii U Pro Controller for playing Wii games...
I don't want Steam on my computer. Does Civilization IV require Steam and/or an internet connection to play single-player game?
No, this version does not require steam. The entire reason I bought this game was because it does not have steam at all.
Cab someone please explain in plain English how to install Civ 4 on a computer with a Windows 7 OS? Please walk me through this.
I also love Civ IV. You have to go into the files and download it to your desktop. I believe you want the run ex file. That should do the trick, if not just email me and I will help you after work. topgram11@gmail.com
I have win 7 and an early version of Civ 4 (the "Game of the Year" edition). I cannot install it on Windows 7. Will this version work with win 7?
windows 7 is listed
Is this game compatiable with Windows 8.1 64 bit edition ?
I have Windows 7 so I can't say for sure; but my guess is that it would work well on 8.1 64 bit edition.
Can I play Civ without the disc once I loaded the game on the computer.
No. The only way you can play this game without the disc is by purchasing a digital copy.
my computer doesnt have a disk drive, is there any way to play this?
I am hoooked on Warlords game. Civ iii & iV Complete Edition will play with out a disk. find a source to download the program from and have at it.
my computer doesnt have a disk drive, is there any way to play this?
I believe the game checks for the disk. No drive, no disk
I am running Windows 7 on my HP laptop. Will I be able to play this game?
Yes
Is there a tech tree flow chart poster included in the box or is it only on the disk in this version?
It was not included in my copy of the game. I should think that if you had to old poster that it would cover the present game.
Does this include the box?
It comes with an abridged instruction booklet (I think) and a dvd in a plastic case. Is this what you meant?
is it Jtaged for copy games? and can European/PAL games work on it?
Not sure I understand your question. This is a customizing case for the hardware. No software comes with this purchase.
Oh. So no special tools needed. But I have one more question, will the custom fan (Tailsmoon Wisper Fan) be a problem with the casing?
I installed the ghost case along with the whisper fan with no problem. still running strong after a year of heavy use.
Oh. So no special tools needed. But I have one more question, will the custom fan (Tailsmoon Wisper Fan) be a problem with the casing?
No special tools needed at all. Also, the fans work really well with the casing. If u send me your email address I can send you a pic of what it looks like after its all installed.
The opening tools are the screwdrivers, right? Or do I hav to get that seprate?
When I replaced mine I just used a flat head screw driver and a knife. When it got to the clips on the back of the casing I just grabbed both halves at the front and ripped it open. The casing started to bend but the clips came undone and there was no damage at all. Of course proceed at your own risk
is this just a case or is it that actual console
Just the case
Can somebody please provide me a link onto how to take apart the Xbox 360 case and also the instruction on installing the ghost case?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPuf8KXAK88 as to installing the new case, just play the video backwards, the case is identical to the factory case so it should go on without problems. help it helps! :)
i want just the cd with the jeopardy music theme do u have it

Does this work on Windows 8.1?
Yes
Do you have to type in your answers?
No. You get four options to choose from for your response.
Is this multiple choice?
yes
Does it work on a Mac?
Hi, No, the one you are looking at is for Windows. To find a Mac one, go to the Amazon Search and type in Jeopardy Deluxe Mac and you should find them. The box is white for the mac, blue for the windows. Thanks. Rocky
Can you play multiple live players at home or just computerized players?
You can play with up to 3 live players at home.
Does this come with a CD
Yes it does and is very easy to upload to your pc.
can it be used on a regular pc
I run mine on my laptop but did not buy a special version. I have Windows 7 but found that it works better on a previous version.For most things I run my laptop as a pc.
Does it work on Windows 7?
Yes, it works on Windows 7. I installed mine and it download just fine. I have a HP laptop computer. I recommend this Jeopardy game and The Price Is Right.
will this work on widows 7?
Yes. Bought it for my GF and she has windows 7
Will this work on a cable splitter?
This product lets you convert from the RF output with RCA-type plug on the computer/game console to a F-type RF antenna male connector that screws into your TV F-Type antenna input directly. That means, you have to unscrew the CATV provider cable from the TV and plug this one coming from the console in order to use it. In order to avoid having to go to the back of the TV set every time to switch inputs, you can plug both this product and your CATV signal coaxial cable into the IN connectors on a switch like this one https://www.amazon.com/RCA-VH71-Slide-Switch/dp/B00009W3F2/ref=lp_6291368011_1_10?s=lamps-light&ie=UTF8&qid=1402970350&sr=1-10 and then its TV SET output through a coaxial cable into your TV set's antenna input. Then the switch will let you select either the CATV provider or your computer/game console.
it shows the adapter hooked to the t.v, so how do you hook up the cable for your cable t.v, if the input has the apapter in it?
I used a cable splitter. One connection for the cable to go to the TV and another for the adapter.
Does anybody know if this adapter works for the Turbografx game system?
Yes it does. it works better the orignal adapter.
Any idea if this will work on an Odyssey II? The single RF outlet prong on the Odyssey II looks a bit thicker than the RCA
I have used this on a few different old systems and it has worked great for each one. I think it would.
Has anyone used this with an Odyssey 400?
It works well on mine. I have also used it on the old Atari and it has worked well.
Can it work on the Atari 2600?
Yes i use in my atari and intellevicion
Will it work with Atari 5200?
I believe so
does anyone know if this will work with the old NES
It will but the NES needs an RCA cable also. Get a single RCA style cable or use half of an audio / video cable if you have one handy and plug it into the NES RF out, then the other side gets this coax adapter.
Does this work with the newer flat screen Tv's? How does the picture look with it?
In order to work with the TV, the TV must have an OTA or "over the air" tuner, to be able to tune into the legacy channels 2-13 (VHF). If your tv does not have this type of input, you may still be able to connect it through an older VCR. If you don't have a VCR, your local thrift shop is sure to have one, but get it quick before they're all gone :) Make sure that the VCR has composite outputs that are compatible with your new digital television. If you TV only has HDMI, you should have got a different tv. You can also get an RF to composite adapter box, but these are quite pricy ($150)
Does it have volume controls on it and a mute button? The picture does not zoom in so I can't see.
It does. They're at the edge of the top left
DOES IT WORK WITH WINDOWS 8 AND 8.1?
Yes.
Do the Home/End buttons require additional keys to be pressed (aka Function key)? What about F-keys (F1, F2, etc)? Location of Home/End?
Home and End are located on the Num Pad and require Num Lock to be off. The F-keys are standard set up, nothing special.
Is this keyboard wireless.
No.
Is is compatible with Macs?
The device itself is. But the software is not. And some of the macroed buttons are not. And the function buttons don't work. But the side pad and stuff still do.
The keypad to the left, can we use it to move the character about similar to the arrow keys?
yes, most definitely! should you be able to get a close up shot of the keyboard to the left, you will see the six main keys in the center which includes the q, a w, s, e, d in the centermost area. all of the numeric keys are up above those from 1-11. the keys to the left of the q and a keys cover the alt, shift, caps, tab, and control keys. the keys to the right of the e an d keys cover the alphas, r, t, f, g, v, b, p, c and a "jump" key. i hope that you can get a good "visual" from the description that i gave. When I first got the keyboard, I thought that there was no way that I could become functionable with the set up. Honestly, the transition was so very fast! I first transitioned by using the keyboard to the left and at times hit some of the keys on the regular keyboard to play. I do believe that you will be very happy with it!
What are the overall dimensions ?
21.5" x 7.5"
Does the keyboard blue led so you can see it at night?
Yes, the LED in the keyboard has 3 colour options, Red, Blue, and Purple. There's a button at the top for colour change and LED brightness.
Does the keyboard utilize mechanical switches?
No, I guess they're not mechanical switch keys; Steelseries would specify that on their site for this keyboard if it were I'm pretty sure. The feel is very good, so some people think it is mechanical; I can't tell by using it. I recommend you find a Bestbuy that has one and check it out; you can probably even get them to hook it up to a pc so you can try it. Then thank them for their time and buy from Amazon for the better price :)
Can the programmable key functions be different/application dependent? (E.g. F9 in Chrome enters name &amp; pw, but F9 in Excel runs a different macro).
Even though the profiles are really out of date, you can still go in and set them up any way you want. So every key is configurable for whatever you want. Just set up the profiles and make sure to select the right one before going in to your application. I've had my keyboard for a couple months now and have barely scratched the surface of the configuration options.
if I make a purchase today, could you email code to me?
This one doesn't send you a code, it mails it within a week.
What is the difference between this gold card and the newer version - besides price - wouldn't this one still provide 12 months of xbox live? thanks!
Just the price. It's still 12 months of xbox live.
I have two grandsons. Do I need to get a card for each of them or will one card for the Xbox 360 work for both of them?
If both grandsons intend on playing on the same account than one card would be fine. If both grandsons want to have their own separate accounts it would be better to buy 2. If they only have one xbox, I would suggest 1 for now, and if they seem to want to add another account later than so be it.
Sorry what's this for is it for playing live? I just want this so i can download games for my son. Can I download 2 games per month. Any games?
Yes, this is for XBox Live. The same as the membership that you would charge to your credit card but you are just prepaying for 12 months (I think they have a six month plan too). I'm not sure on downloading games. I think that might be different. They have XBox gift cards for that. We ordered one of those too. Hope this helps.
What does this card do does it give the person on line game to play Id like to get this for my sons new xbox 1 thanks
Yeah it gives you access to Xbox LIVE play online etc. but as soon i redeem the code it would log me off when i turn on my Xbox or even when i use my apps such as Netflix or Youtube it was working fine when I didnt have access to LIVE I need to call Xbox for support to fix the problem. This is what im experiencing after i bought it online for the first time, before i would get them at Target,711 or just straight from the menu from your Xbox.Hope this helps you out in some way.
Do I need a Gold starter kit too? My son had a xbox live account but it expired I want to reactivate so I bought this yesterday, is this all I need?
I believe so. Even if his account expired you should just be able to reactivate with this card. Kinda like a prepaid phone card would work.
if i buy this product today can i use it next year? in other words my xbox member ship has about 6 months left, so can i buy this now and use it later
gold memberships do not expire. My iy can also redeem it now and it adds on to your membership.
Can I send electronically to someone?
It depends on who you send it to,for family and friends as a gift buy the card send them the 26 digit code on back of the card thru email or cell phone, once code is used card is no good,if it's for selling to a stranger,it won't work.
I just received card in the mail to give as a gift and it says Made in Singapore and has both English and Asian language written on it. Will it work?
Yes it worked fine. I was worried also,but it worked fine
I received this and it has English and Chinese written on package. Is this product in English???
Yes if it has both languages just incase you dont know one of them. It could be the product was made in China but no big deal you use it and disgard or recycle once used the pin. Enjoy.

I'm not sure on downloading games. I think that might be different. They have XBox gift cards for that. We ordered one of those too. Hope this helps.
What does this card do does it give the person on line game to play Id like to get this for my sons new xbox 1 thanks
Yeah it gives you access to Xbox LIVE play online etc. but as soon i redeem the code it would log me off when i turn on my Xbox or even when i use my apps such as Netflix or Youtube it was working fine when I didnt have access to LIVE I need to call Xbox for support to fix the problem. This is what im experiencing after i bought it online for the first time, before i would get them at Target,711 or just straight from the menu from your Xbox.Hope this helps you out in some way.
Do I need a Gold starter kit too? My son had a xbox live account but it expired I want to reactivate so I bought this yesterday, is this all I need?
I believe so. Even if his account expired you should just be able to reactivate with this card. Kinda like a prepaid phone card would work.
if i buy this product today can i use it next year? in other words my xbox member ship has about 6 months left, so can i buy this now and use it later
gold memberships do not expire. My iy can also redeem it now and it adds on to your membership.
Can I send electronically to someone?
It depends on who you send it to,for family and friends as a gift buy the card send them the 26 digit code on back of the card thru email or cell phone, once code is used card is no good,if it's for selling to a stranger,it won't work.
I just received card in the mail to give as a gift and it says Made in Singapore and has both English and Asian language written on it. Will it work?
Yes it worked fine. I was worried also,but it worked fine
I received this and it has English and Chinese written on package. Is this product in English???
Yes if it has both languages just incase you dont know one of them. It could be the product was made in China but no big deal you use it and disgard or recycle once used the pin. Enjoy.
if I make a purchase today, could you email code to me?
This one doesn't send you a code, it mails it within a week.
What is the difference between this gold card and the newer version - besides price - wouldn't this one still provide 12 months of xbox live? thanks!
Just the price. It's still 12 months of xbox live.
I have two grandsons. Do I need to get a card for each of them or will one card for the Xbox 360 work for both of them?
If both grandsons intend on playing on the same account than one card would be fine. If both grandsons want to have their own separate accounts it would be better to buy 2. If they only have one xbox, I would suggest 1 for now, and if they seem to want to add another account later than so be it.

please tell me what is in this 149.99 item,only trackir 5? or with clip pro in it?thank you .
The 149.99 is for the tracker 5 only. The clip pro is not included. I have the clip pro but do not use it.
Does it work with Windows 7 and Windows 8?
Yes. I am currently running Windows 8 and works great.
I wear a really thin pair of headphones when I game, is it a wise idea to get the clip pro over this or will this be fine and comfortable?
I considered buying the track clip pro as well but decided against it after reading some reviews stating how fragile it is. The benefits didn't seem to justify the additional $. Unless your monitor is facing direct sunlight and you hate wearing a cap indoors, then the track clip pro will be the way to go. Else the standard reflectors works just fine and it seems very responsive to me. No discernible lag whatsoever.
What is this thing? Is it a new type of monitor, is it something you wear or is it something like the Kinect for the PC? I don't really understand it.
It's an IR camera that tracks head movement by bouncing IR off of a clip you attach to a hat. It's used in gaming to translate your head movement into corresponding movement in game. For example, in a flight simulator (where I use it), it is used to control your view in 3d cockpits, giving 6 degrees of freedom in the cockpit as if you were really there. It is fantastic and I highly recommend it.
Can you set an "escape" hot key that would disable the TrackIr input while it's held down, for use with fine aiming or menus?
The other option you have, which is what I use, is to customize the dead zone/sensitivity of the Trackir so that your head center dead zone is higher and thus will not actuate until head movement is greater than X amount of your choosing.
Does it work with WOWP?
All supported games are listed on their website! :) http://www.naturalpoint.com/trackir/03-enhanced-games/enhanced-games-all.html
Has anyone used this in conjunction with VR glasses for flight simulators (like the sony HMZ T-3W)?
I haven't, but it doesn't have any effect on video. If you can look around with the keyboard or mouse, this will work fine. Probably be pretty cool. I don't see why it wouldn't work. Kind of a lot of gear on your head though.
What is the shipping weight and size?
The package as shown above is about eight inches tall and only a couple of ounces. It arrived in a box that was like 4" x 6" x 8". I don't have it in front of me, but the above are fairly close.
Can the device be fitted to the side of the monitor? Or does it have to be the top?
Maybe if your monitor is very thin, but it is probably best for viewing angle if its at the top.
Does it need to be in a well lighted room to work? And how much do you need to move for it to work?
No, it uses IR technology to "see". It has 4 IR LEDs inside the unit that provides it's own light. The light from these IR LEDs reflects off the attachment on your head (Pro-clip or the one that comes with this item) and back to the main unit where it records the location of the reflections. The following are images I googled to elaborate on how the TrackIr can "see": https://www.google.com/search?q=ir+led&safe=off&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS547US547&espv=2&biw=1920&bih=993&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=xr6eVOqhC4apyQSgv4GgAw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#safe=off&tbm=isch&q=ir+led+effects+on+digital+camera&spell=1&facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=xIRi19iwEBxv_M%253A%3BwxkUqO9lMLcJYM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F6%252F67%252FP1020168.JPG%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FInfrared%3B2560%3B1920 Your next question is tougher to answer. Within the software that runs the system you can modify how much you have to move (its resolution). Just like the DPI settings for your mouse. I'm pretty sure if you were to make it as sensitive as possible you could spin your character's view quicker than you can see things on the screen. Like taking your mouse and wiggling it vigorously and the mouse cursor almost becoming invisible, if you know what I mean.
will this game work on windows 7?
Yes! I have seen it work on Vista, 7, and 8.1. The computer I play it on is 64-bit Windows 7.
Will this run on XP SP3????
I wouldn't advise it. Since Microsoft servers do not support a lot of XP systems anymore. I suggest upgrading to Windows seven. I have Windows 7 Ultimate and a great video card. If you do this, make sure your power supply in your pc can handle a better video card. Otherwise, you can damage your system.
If I want to use my joystick - Logitech's WingMan Extreme Digital 3D (USB) - will I need an emulator, and do you know if this model will work? Thanks.
well an emulator is to mimick a console. I know controllers work. so I would assume it would work. but if not you can get it to work with a 3rd party software like joy2pad or something.
If I select PC and buy it, is it a download, or does it send me a physical copy?
If it just said "PC" it will send you a physical copy of the game... If it said "PC Download" then you would be able to get it trough download...
it is on steam?
nope...
Can I get this delivered to Australia
Yes we can. Please order it and check our rate also
will this game operate on windows 8, also does the pc version support LAN?
I am not sure Its a good game. I have Windows 7 Professional also new computer Alienware played older Computer.
is this redeemable on steam or do i just get the game and thats it i boot it from the disk
NOP sadly in can only be booted from disc and the original servers from activision for blur doesn't work anymore, the onyl way to play online is with tunngle http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DP-ygfhSQA
Is it compatible with osx computers?
The answer is yes, it works on mac. It gets recognized automatically system wide as a USB gamepad. Literally plug and play. Both controllers were recognized in sixtyforce too.
Can you use two of these for 4 player games; IE Mario Party?
yes you can
Does this work on Windows 8?
Yes it does
Does the adapter work on a wii-u since it has USB ? Or does anyone know of a N64 to Wii-u adapter yet ?
I don't think it will but youcould probably use this n64 to GameCube adapter and them the GameCube to wii u if you really wanted. http://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/n64_to_wii/
Can I plug in two of these for a total of four players?
Yes
I have a Win 7 notebook, will this adapter work on my computer?
Yeah you just have to calibrate it with your windows 7. Look it up on YouTube if you have to or google.
can I use the controller for any PC games, not just N64 emulation?
If you use Xpadder you can.
How long is the cable for this adapter?
36 inches
Does this work on Windows 7 and would it work with Mortal Kombat X on PC?
Yes.
Does this work with the wii?
This is not meant for use with the Wii. Only PC/Mac. http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Nintendo-Wii-Gamecube-Game-Cube/dp/B007PVC30M This is the item you want for N64 to Wii.
Can you pull off a shoryuken with this guy
Yep, and lasts more than a week. Best one I've found.
How long is the USB cable? I can't seem to find that on Amazon or Buffalo's site (my Japanese is pretty much nil).
The cord is 5 feet 6 inches, I used a tape measure.
can this work on Windows 8 and is this only intended to be used for the SNES emulator or can I play other games I have on my pc via Steam?
I can confirm that it works on windows 8, and if you use a program like joy to key you can very easily make it work with steam. My only complaint is that one of the buttons began sticking after only a few hours.
Does this work with raspberry pi?
Yes
Has anybody tried this with an emulator on Android?
I've used 3 of them on various raspberry pi projects with 100% success. I would guess that if your android device has USB Host, you should be fine.
Can you configure the buttons to specific keys? I want to program buttons for shortcut commands like CTRL+Z, for example.
This can be accomplished with programs such as Xpadder, AutoHotKey, or EventGhost. You can do this with most any controller, though.
Does this Buffalo Game controller have R and L buttons? Pic doesn't show it.
Yes it has the L and R bumpers on the top of the controller. I did a video review of this controller that people seem to like, you can watch it here: http://youtu.be/UgiI711zZiw
Does it work with linux?
I run Ubuntu 12.04; it's been fine for ZSNES.
If I buy two of them and plug each one into a usb port, I should be able to play 2 player games like this, correct?
Yes but this isn't based on the controller, its based on whether or not the software you're using to play the game allows two players. If it does (and usually it should) there should be minimal issues.
Does it come with a CD to configure controls or does it have plug and play compatibility?
it's plug-and-play, no cd included.
How bad is the language in this game? Is there an option to turn it off?
At least on the Xbox 360, not any way that I'm aware of. They do not ever use the "F" word and you will often hear them using other words purposefully instead of the actual curse word. But, they will say curse words every now and then. But, if you're worried about the foul language in the game, I wouldn't advise letting anyone young play this.
Do you have to be hooked to the internet to play this game?
No you don't. Best game ever
Is the co-op mode splitscreen?
Yes
what age is it appropriate for
The first one is rated M-Mature so I assume this one would be the same. The game involves shooting zombies so there is a lot of gore in it. Heads and limbs are blown off the zombies. I have seen in the options where you can turn down the gore, but of course I have never tried it. Its a fun game where you have to learn to work with teammates to survive. I'm not a mother so I really don't know what age I'd recommend, but if I had to I'd say... high school, maybe the middle school age if you turn down the gore.
Are explicit sexual acts done in this game? I was told very detailed sex acts were shown.
Not as far as I know. I can't speak for the dlc however. Also don't trust me.
can you play 4 person offline co op?
I m not sure. I know you can play two players co op offline
Description says that 1 is jump and 2 shoot, in reg.mario bros from wii store download 1 is shoot and 2 is jump, can you switch controls to be normal?
The description must have a typo; on our wii 1 = shoot 2 = jump. As a note, the 1 has a dual purpose; shoot and run
Is this compatible with a wii bought in Singapore?
You just have to make sure ur wii has american system i think if it's british this would not work this is from my experience I'm not sure if it's true or not
i need a game that fits a3dsl
You need to buy a DS or 3ds Mario game.
Does this use the classic controller?
No it doesn't. You can only use the Wii remote. You can either have it turned on its side, or have the nunchuck hooked up to it.
can a 5 year old play this game?
I really don't know my grandson was 8 when I get it for him.
when was this game released?
Nov. 2009
Will this play on the Wii Mini?
Yes, i have the Wii mini and it works
can you play this on a wii u? also can u play this off screen on the wii u gamepad?
You can play all Wii games on the Wii U as long as you have the wii remote. You cannot play Wii games on the Wii U gamepad, though.
Myself and one other person I know purchased this game when it was first released. Now when we load it in Wii it won't work, says it's not readable(both games, no damage to them) ??
I purchased this game along with another for my son and we have had no problems whatsoever with either one.
Do you need nunchuks to play this game or just the remote?
You can play with just the remote

You can play with just the remote
Do you realy need the balance board?
The balance board does all kinds of things besides your weight (horrors!). Some of the games are made to help your balance, as in you shift your weight to make them work such as skiing, or hula hooping, even making balls drop through levels or the step exercises (just like in the gym). The running/jogging things you don't need it for but I would suggest it because so many of the fun ones use it.
Is it in color?
If you have a color TV or monitor
Is this NTSC or PAL?
This video game works within the Wii console, it does not work within a computer system only within the Wii game console.
Do you need the fit meter in order to use wii fit u?
No. The fit meter is only an add on to measure daily activity which then adds to the Wii Fit U score.
I enjoy the original WII Fit but dislike that it goes to a rating and time screen after each activity. Does the Plus program do this also?
Yes it does.that part is just like the regular wii fit. But the plus has so much more fun activities and is way better then just the reg.fit.
I bought a Wii Fit U w/Balance Board and Fit Meter. The software that came with the combo was blank. Will this software CD as a replacement?
Yes
i would like to know the differencesbetween wii fit and wii fit plus? to me the activities and everything seem the same.
yes the plus has a few more yoga poses and strenth training as well as a few other balance games too. Both are good
will this system work with a U.S. purchased sysyem. thanjs
Yes! Perfectly. NO problems.
what is a pal version?
Isn't that the European system???
can you work out without the balance board?
A couple of the things you can, but most require the board to make sure you're doing exercise right, weight check. The only thing I do not use board for is the running. In my opinion, the game itself is too costly, since you won't be able to do most exercises, without the board. But your answer is, yes you can do w/o board.

No
Is this a 05g model or below for CFW?
05g? As far as i know, psp doesn't get updates anymore and all can have cfw (i have proC update cfw installed)
can you play ps vita games on it????
No just your standard psp games but this is just a straight download device so you have to download your games or cinvert your games to computer and then to the go. My opinion of this psp is its not bad its nice to not carry all those games. but it sucks downloading games cause it takes to long. hopes this helps
what memory card type does this system use
It uses a proprietary sony memory card called an "M2". It is also used by some sony ericson phones.
can i still buy psp games and download them from the playstation store to the psp go?
Yes
what is the BULK PACKAGING??? no box????
No OEM/Manufacturers packaging.
PSPgo vs PSP 3000. What should I best consider as a gift for my 8 year old son. Would appreciate some feedback. Thanks.
The psp 3000 is a great gift for your son
brings charger and cable? you have the box? Greetings
Yes, it comes with the charger. it also contains manuals. basically the psp is like new.
does it come with a memory stick.?
No u have to buy ur own
Looks like a good game, just not into monthly subscriptions. Is that the only way to play this?
other than the free thirty day trial that is correct.
does this game come as downloable content, or must i purchase and wait for game disks? i'm asking for the ps3 version
You can download it through the PSN and do not have to wait for the disks. I will caution you however that the PS3 version is not really very good due to its hardware limitations etc. It's playable, but tends to be very laggy in high traffic areas. I stuck it out until the PS4 version came out, and used that instead. If you don't have a PS4, you can still play well enough to justify buying the game for PS3 though. Hope that helps!
Registration info? I tried to play this game I bought but it's impossible without a valid registration.. Can someone help?
You have to buy the game new once it is opened and the code is used the disc is useless
I know this has sort of been asked already, but let me reword the question, because it wasn't asked exactly like this. Is the only option to play this game is to play it online and pay a monthly subscription, or is there an offline story you can play...
Yes Zines, You have already answered your question. Although this game is so addictive, YOU CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION BY ANY WAY, there's no offline game, even the main story needs a monthly fee. YES, it's a dumb. You pay only for a Blue ray disc with the game data and an online pass for 30 days of TRIAL, when those days ran out, a message like this appears "you have to pay a subscription in order to play". That's a shame...
When you buy the PS3 version on Amazon, do you get a code when it ships? or do you have to wait for your physical copy to ship through mail?
Physical copy.
I bought a new copy of the game but the registration coed doesn't work..
Contact the company. I have had that happen before.
game did not come with registration code
You need to contact amazon and/or square about that. Mine was on the back of the book in the case.
Why is it mature?
It has mild blood, violence, very little language. It just BARELY scrapes up to mature. I have had this talk with a bunch of people wanting to get their child Reach. It should not be rated Mature, and the thousands and thousands of times I have played it I have never felt "disturbed" or like it was inappropriate for children. You DO do things like run aliens over, or jab a knife in their brainpan, but it is just comic violence. Like LEGO games; isn't it morbid to hit someone and have them explode into pieces? ;) Just saying, this game has violence but it is very mild. Many of the Halo games are not deserving of their Mature rating. Hope this helps you some!
can i multiplayer on halo reach
Yes you can
Can this be played without an XBOX Live membership?
Yes it can
Does the Halo Reach come with the code for the Flaming Helmet?
no
Do I need xbox live gold edition to play?
Only if you want to go on line to play with it others. Other wise you can play anytime yourself
can this be played online with friends
Yes it can
Is this halo reach game work on pc's? (laptops)
In short, no. Halo 1 & 2 were ported to the pc, but they stopped doing that after 2. All the other Halo games (Reach included) only work on the consoles they were made for. The only way to play Reach on the pc is to do some serious hacking, or use an illegal torrent to download a hacked copy. The one pictured here was specifically made for the xbox 360, so it will not work on a pc (again, not without some serious hacking).
Is XBox live (or internet connection) required to play?
No. At least, not for the campaign (story mode), which can be played locally by two persons. Matchmaking is the only part of the game where Xbox Live Gold is highly advisable. I'd recommend Internet connection with a base Live account (no gold) if you want to keep track of your records and achievements.
Can anyone tell me which game is better, Halo 4 or Halo Reach?
Depends on the kind of fun you want. Bungie did Reach so there is a lot of fun to be had where the characters are actually funny and the playability is great. Halo 4 (not Bungie) takes itself far more seriously little to no "fun" stuff, just an attempt to make the story more serious. Halo 4 has immensely better graphics and if you like thick plot and story and a solid multi-player then that's your game (co-op is completed in less than a few days so not worth it for just that). Reach was the pinnacle of Bungie's evolution of the game, a must-have for any Halo fan. I personally don't consider Halo 4 even part of the franchise, more of a spinoff because it's SO different.
How does this game differ from Halo 4? Is it better?
Reach does not have John in it. It is a team of Spartan IIIs. You will be Noble 6. Fighting the covenant attacking Reach. The play is the same in that you kill as many covenant as possible while achieving your team's mission. I liked it better than Halo 4 because I enjoyed playing as part of a team of spartans. Not to say I did not like Halo 4. Also, you get to choose what your armor looks like. Hope this helps.
Does this work with xbox 360 E? http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00D9FQAM0/r...

You will need another cable to connect it. I had to buy another one too!

Yeah, is a perfect gift.

Q: Does this work with xbox 360 ELITE 120 GB?
Says on box it works with any Xbox 360 console. I can not tell you about the ELITE 120 GB. minimum 190MB storage required hope this helps some
This item comes with the power supply cable for the old console? xbox 360 arcade FAT?
It comes with a plug..my kids connected it to the xbox 360..I hope that helps.
how much space is needed?
About 6 feet will be nice to play with Kinect.
is this game compatable for windows 8
Yes & No - Yes if you are playing it WITH the 1.7version patch you get from Bethesda's website. This is to make it compatible with 4 core an more CPU/processors (game was built when 2 core's were common) an other things. Now for modding which I have done, I have no issues with Windows 7 nor should you with Windows 8 (I am aware of it's problems, why I stayed at W7 Pro). because there are mods & fixes for everything at NexusMods. Please remember to install game in folder other than Program Files because Windows UAC feature causes problems. For example C:Games/Fallout3. Also note that Windows Live no longer exists so you can not validate it nor do you have to. You essentially are buying this so not to get malware or viruses from pirated copies or you just do not want to wait forever to download it off steam. Took me 5 days to get it running good with over 50GB worth of mods. Great learning experience, awesome game, 10000X better than when I first played it.
Can you play this with steam?
Yes Rama, i can play it with steam.
Is this game compatible with windows 7?
Yes, I'm running 7.1.
Is this game compatible with windows 7?
I have windows 7 and the game is compatible with my system.
My question is my old game disk is cracked if I buy this can I use the disk for the disk check to play it on my old install without reinstalling?
You should be able to do it. Makes sure it is the same type with the one you got. Sometime there is add on with the new one.
Does it work on Windows 8.1?
Yes, but remember to ask the Steam community if it crashes often.
are the DLCs on a disk or is a code. I'm looking to by used
It's not a code, it comes with 2 disc but I never got to play it. I tried endlessly to install it but I couldn't! ! Very frustrating to say the least. I have Windows 8 on a very nice computer. I tried just about every lead on how to install it but to no prevail. Lucky I have it on Xbox 360, this game is awesome but I wanted to play it on my computer for the conveyance of playing it anywhere. Good luck!!!!
I have this game for steam, but it crashes from time to time..would I have to worry about crash with the disk?
I have the same game too. You have to make your computer compatible for it. There is ways to do this by google and search for compatible mode or use utube videos as well.
Windows 8.1 will not work regardless of the the patches and file editing tweaks. No one has addressed this issue to any degree. So what can I do?
Windows 7 pro, Linux OS in "windows emulator mode", or gamble on Windows 10. If none of that works, then wait for it to be on sale on steam, I bought FA3 on disc an later again on steam because it runs a bit smoother since there is no disc spinning an they made it more multi-core processor friendly, same thing as the multi-core fix, just updated.
Is it multilanguage?
No
how do you know if it is a fake or real game, thanks.
There's many different ways to tell real from fake. The obvious is the case: Pokemon Emerald is a transparent green, fakes may use a solid green; the Official Nintendo Seal will also be on the logo sticker, some fakes forget to put that on; another the nintendo logo on the cartridge (under the casing) which is visible by tilting the game or just taking the back off; the very sad way to figure out the game is a fake is having the save function just not work at all (note that Emerald does not need the internal battery to work to save the game. The internal battery just determines certain in game events and anyways that can be replaced). There isn't any way to tell if the game is fake or not until you have it in your hand (seeing as online sellers can use real images from anywhere and state they are theirs) and when purchasing it's purely based off of trust.
does this have the same plot as ruby/sapphire?
Pokemon Emerald has a similar plot to that of Ruby/Sapphire, however there are some key differences: In Ruby/Sapphire the main antagonist is either team aqua/magma but in Emerald you both are equally dubious, also there are different gym leaders and E4 members. So no they don't have the same plot.
Does it come with a Gameboy Advance Cartridge, and a DS Cartridge? Or just a Gameboy?
if you order a gameboy cartridge like this game it will be able to work on the ds gameboy slot they are the same
Is this fake?
It looks real to me
you can play this on the gameboy color right?
You can play it on the gameboy advance, gameboy advance SP, nintendo DS, or nintendo DS light
How can you reset the game to play it from the beginning after locating everything?
Yep, start a new game, new profile. :)
Do you get a real workout from this game, can you loose weight?
I would say yes. It's like walking on a treadmill. I get more exercise off this game than wii fit.
I bought wii in 2012 . can I use it with Walk it Out. What other efforts it need to implement it ?
You should be able to use it. I just put the cd in and followed the instructions. It is a good program and fun.
I was addicted to the Island Cycling game on Wii Fit Plus. Is this game as fun in your opinion?
Yrs, the game is terrific and addictive. My grandchildren and myself really love it.
Do you need to use the wii balance board with this?
No
is is appropriate for children?
Absolutely appropriate for children! G-rated and fun for kids and adults. Great program.
not counting steps, counts every 1 in 20. set on easy with no miss steps. actually bought new machines and new game disc same problem. any ideas?
Depends on what method you are using. Are you using the dance pad, step or nunchuck? For instance, I use the nunchuck and wrap an ace bandage type of thing for the back around my thigh (it velcros) and just tuck the nunchuck into that. I find it the easiest. BUT, I have to have that nunchuck tucked in there at just the right angle to count the steps correctly. Also, make sure the sensor bar is at the best angle.
Can I use the wii walk it out video game with the wii u
Yes you can. I use my Walk It Out in my WiiU every day.
I have a problem with the contoller. When I am in the menu for pause/save, etc., the controller arrow floats and I can't control it. Does anyone else have this problem?
You may have to use a different controller to see if that one is the problem. I had to switch controllers as one was broken.
We just got the game and are enjoying it, but we can't get mini games to work. When we click on a game icon, nothing happens. Do they need unlocking?
I did not know "Walk it Out" was supposed to have mini games, so I look forward to hearing from someone who's played some.

will this work for the ds lite
Yes it will. That is what I have and it works fine.
Are many of these games good for a single player with no wifi?
I don't use wifi for the DS. There are TONS of games that you can play against the " computer " and/or single player games.
Can single player play against the device, like some pc games, where pc becomes a player? Like in Chess, where you play against the pc?
With the games, you play against the computer(device). And I believe that you can change the settings on certain games, so that you can play against other players and not the computer(device). I don't know if this helps you out at all.
i have bought my first Nintendo, it is DSi XL. This classic games work in DSi XL??
WOW. I purchased this game for my nephew a while back. I believe this was for the regular DS game. It worked fine. I don't see a reason why it shouldn't work on yours. You can also ask the seller if it will work on your DSi XL. Hope I've been of some help.

I have a Saitek Pro Flight Multi Panel but recently the knob to select alt, vs, etc is stuck, how can I do in order to fix it??
Stuck Knob Solution here! Hello, I had the same problem and found the perfect solution online (for just $2.99): In order to fix this problem you just need a larger knob which provides the extra leverage needed to (effortlessly) turn the knob. The original knob should come off easily by wiggling and pulling at the same time. The knob is attached to a 1/4'' shaft so any larger knob that fits a 1/4'' shaft will do fine. I used one from radio shack (Model: 274-407), which was 1/4'' shaft and it also contained a micro screw that you can tighten to ensure a snug fit. This knob slightly covers the labels (ALT,VS IAS, etc) but because these values show up on the screen as you tune to them, it's no big deal for me. Btw, I attempted to contact Saitek for a solution and shocker! -No Response.
Is the flap control a 3-way rotating lever, or an up/middle/down switch? I currently use one of the levers from a throttle quadrant as a flap control.
Its a toggle switch up an down only and not similar to actual flight flap system. I still prefer using m joystick lever for flaps
Can this panel work with X-Plane 10?
Yes, you must download the Saitek plugins from X-plane.org and put them in your plugins folder in X-plane. You may have to turn the plugins on.
Works on X plane 10 without downloading drivers?
You have to download a plug-in from X-plane.org. Install in plug-in folder. Activate the plug-in.
Should the unit light up as soon as its plugged into A USB port? Nothing lights up.
Provided the computer is powered on, my mini-screen displays a dull red glow. Once I start MS-FLTSIM X, a test follows and then it displays what it's supposed to.
I have a Cessna trim wheel for pitch control -- will the trim wheel on this panel conflict with its operation? And if so, what's the recommended workaround? Thanks!
I doubt there will be conflict between the two. I once had two controls for the flaps, one on the panel, one on the throttle quadrant. You'd just have two controls for one thing. Plus in Flight Sim it splits the different controllers into categories, so it may do that for your wheel.
Is there a waranty on this item? Mine has failed after 4 months and I was wondering where I can get it fixed. The CRS-HDG-IAS-VS-ALT switch is frozen
Yes, just go to Saitek's web site and contact them.
Does this require a driver download for Windows 8.1?
Yes mine did but it was very easy. Install the disk and device with the disk. Go to www.saitek.com click on downloads on the top bar, click on software, then select the product Pro Flight Range from the drop down, then select the Pro Flight Multi Panel from the next drop down. Then select the type of OS 32 or 64. Finally select driver download and make sure you click save then you are ready to go. You can also get the Drivers for X Plane 9 and 10 here on the same site and page. IF you need to update more than just select make another selection on the same page.
do the pro flight panels work on mac`s?
Yes they work on the mac... I used them for X-Plane on a mac a couple of years back and they worked wonderfully... but please visit this thread...and use the link on the posts there for the plugin...you might have to use the plug in. http://forums.pilotedge.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=886 you will find the plugins here http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?app=downloads&showfile=14646 -cheers
Do this Saitek panel and Radio Panel work with X-Plane Challenger 300 aircraft?. Thanks.
Hello, As long as the latest Xplane drivers and plugins are installed prior to connecting the radio panel then yes it should work.
Does it work with DCS?
What's DCS?
What Does This Do?
It's a USB device that's used to control, and display information from, the in-game radio stack in Microsoft Flight Simulator (FS2004, FSX), or, through 3rd-party drivers available online, other flight simulator games such as X-Plane or Prepar3d. You can dial in any two of the following channels for your aircraft and adjust their frequencies: COM1, COM2, NAV1, NAV2, ADF, DME, or the Transponder Code (although I've had difficulty getting the transponder to work). Adjusting things on this panel while in-flight updates them on the in-game virtual radio stack and vice versa. Hope this helps.
If i add alot of these like half a cockpit do i need to upgrade my Power supply?
No mate, they are USB devices, I run 6 of these on my flightsim with no problem at all
can in work with Win8?
It will 99 percent work in win 8 I have x plane and u had to download a plugin but it works great
My radio panel was worknin fine. Now, when I select a frequency and press ACTIVATE, the numbers appear to switch but do not stay set. Any suggestions? I am using three Saitet panels together (radio, multi, etc)
Hi, a couple of thoughts on this. I had the same thing happen when I went to a new PC. It was USB 3.0 and the Saiteks are 2.0. I solved this by plugging a USB 2.0 expansion port in. Problem gone. I have dual Saitek Yokes, Pedals, two radios and the BIP. Also, I have seen similar behavior with a Go Flight Autopilot. I finally used cleaner on the potentiometers. Caution, this will void any warranty you have left. Hope this helps
Does this work with X-Plane?
Yes. Use the xsaitekpanels plug-in available on the X plane.org site. I have had no problem switching the radio channels or the navigation channels. I haven't tried the ADF or DME function.
Can this be used on a mac?
Yes just download the Saitek panels plugin and it will work for Mac/Win
Does the psp version have announcer tables that you can destroy during the match
I found this online: "First, remove the top of the announcer's table using A while next to the table. Then, with a finisher or signature icon, irish whip HHH on to the announcer's table and press Y." http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/960291-wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010/53149039
Does the PSP version of the game have announcer tables during the match
no it does not have announcer table during match
I have a late model 1 sega genesis. Will this cable work? The RF connector in the pic doesn't look as though it will fit my system. Thanks!
Yes. This is the same cable I'm using for my mk1 genesis
does this allow sega genesis 1 to work on HD Tvs?
Yes
new t v old sega need adapters
RF switch from AV to coax will work.
How many pins are on the end of this cable that connects to the game console?
Doesn't really matter, just know that this will fit ONLY the Model #1 Genesis... if you don't know if you have a model 1 or not, look it up on the internet or go to a game store and talk to someone over 30yo.
Is this cable compatible with the Sega Master System?
No
Will this fit the Sega Genesis system model number MK-1631 9 pin?
Sorry, this cable is for what is known as a 'Model 1' Genesis. You have a 'Model 2' Genesis. What you need is here (copy & paste the following link into your address bar): http://www.amazon.com/Sega-Genesis-Standard-Cable-Bulk-Packaging/dp/B002GCFI2K | Sega Genesis 2 & 3 Standard AV Cable
does this work on the Sega CDX?
Hmmm im not rly sure, I javnt seen the cdx, I do know the outlet in the back was NOT at all the same as on the cord and its the sega genesis 1 as well. Look very closely at pictures of.this cord and see if the back matches perfectly, I swore this did but I was wrong
Can I invert the x-axis with this controller? Some PS3 games don't offer this option, making these titles unplayable/unenjoyable for me.
I use it on my pc, allowing me to go in to the calibration of the controller which allows me to insert the axis if needed. I don't have any experience with ps3 so I wouldn't be able to help out much there.
Has anyone ever tried to remap the R1 and R2, L1 and L2 buttons on the PS3 and get that to work? (do not use CAN in your answer; only DID)
R/L 1 is linked to R/L 4 which is located where your middle fingers rest right underneath the controller (that is if you don't set them to be anything else) and I had set them to R/L 2, so R/L 1&4 and R/L 2 became swapped. I had trouble learning how to do it but it's all in the instruction book, just a little confusing to learn, plus it remembers it so next time you turn it on just activate the "swap" button (glows green on right) and it will have your saved swapped set. Btw the batteries don't last long on it, I would get a corded one.
Does it work on a mac?
Haven't found the driver for it.
I hate xpadder, will this controller without the use of xpadder? Say, like plug and play and my games recognize it as an xbox controller?
Ours going to get recognized as "run and drive" from the get go. I had an xbox controller before this one do the drivers were still on my computer. No such luck with it being recognized a one.
what sort of battery does this thing use? can u use AA/aaa rechargeables and get good hours on it?
This use 2 AAA batteries, yes you can use rechargeables ones to save money.
How do the triggers feel? They look flat, maybe like Wii U triggers. I like springy triggers more.
the triggers are very good and have lots of spring to them, I love this gamepad for my laptop when im on the road
Does it come with a Charger
Yes, it came with a charger. :]
would the charger and pen be included with the console/
Yeah, they come with a charger and stylus.
can nintendo dsl 3d games be played on the nintendo 3d system?
Yeah, ds/dsi games can be played on the 3ds, but they won't be able to be played using the 3D feature, only in 2D, only 3DS games will be able to play using the 3D feature. Hope this helps
Does it work with ds games?
Yes, but action replays for the ds won't. U have to get one specific for the 3ds, but normal ds games work just fine.
Does it come with a charging cradle?
Yes it does its really nice
Is an SD card really necessary for the 3DS?
since it comes with one yes it kind of is, also it allows you to download more content and a place to save your pics and what not
Is there a way to turn off the 3D effect while playing, ie a 2D mode?
Yes

Is good for 9 year old
It is violent. A lot of shooting and killing people. Online can be very graphic and people are very profane. In my opinion, no, it's not acceptable for a 9 year old. If my son was 9, I wouldn't allow him to play it.
good for kids
It will keep them very entertained but they may have more interest in guns
can you turn of blood
is there local multiplayer or do you need live.
Are there bots like in Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 &amp; 2??
Yes if you don't have online then you can play bots, there are plenty of YouTube videos showing.

You unlock everything by a point system that you gain slowly throughout the game. You have to save enough points to unlock each iteam that you want.

I would like to know the difference between "Call of Duty: Ghosts - Xbox 360" and "Call of Duty: Ghosts (Onslaught DLC Included) - Xbox 360"
I mean there Is some difference other than the map packs u get a new weapon called the maverick that switches from assault rifle into a sniper rifle and the new map packs Bayview, Containment, Ignition, and Fog. plus the Michel Myers Easter egg just complete a field order and u might obtain it it's like the maniac kill streak but with an axe instead my opinion and rating 7.5 good! : A solid game that definitely has an audience. Might lack replay value, could be too short or there are some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun. Hope this helped! &#128515;
is it split screen
Yes the multiplayer is 2 player split screen and you can also play online multiplayer on one TV with 2 people split screen.

Yes. It had the offer code,but if you get it used,it its probably used already. There is also a rare special edition box set but it is VERy expensive .

I am not a seller. I bought a used game from Amazon. It came with a plastic case.
Hi I want to know if I take this game GOTY edition, my ps3 european first version reads it? Are of Italy
Hey. The main game is region free, so it should work. The DLC is usually region locked, but for this game the DLC is only for multiplayer. This is where i get my info that the game is region free: http://www.play-asia.com/uncharted-2-among-thieves-paOS-13-49-en-70-39ew.html
When the DLC content codes game expired?
Mine were already redeemed because I bought it used. If you look up the actual dlc content, you'll see that you aren't missing all that much. It is likely that the codes expired even if the game is new...considering it is several years old now.
Is it in a box which includes the manual and the offer code
Yeah mine had a code to access all the bonus multi-player stuff because it was game of the year edition.
that difference has this game UNCHARTED 2: Among Thieves GREATEST HITS ???, the original game ??? and because it comes in a red cover ???
Pretty much... The one I received had an code to redeem for the add ons & it was invalid.
does this game have a training mode or local match with bots?
yes hard bots to play its straight
Does this still come with the voucher to download the PSP version of Call of Duty?
No it did not.
it is a usa version?
Yes it's the USA version.. The game is amazing!!
PlayStation TV Compatibility?
I'm not sure.
does this have campaign
yes
Is there an option to turn off the cursing in game?
No I don't believe there is but its not a very gory game when you kill guys they just lay like dolls for a while.
is multiplayer
Is there online multiplayer? Yes, 4 v4.
How is the online gameplay? a lot of of lag? does many people still play online?
Online is overall worth it. Maps are smaller but make for great head to head battles. Online doesnt lag. It may occasionally kick you out of a match for no reason but it only occurs once or twice every few days. Easy fix, just close the game and go back in. Overall, the online is good enough to have the game because of simple, yet really good loadouts and the maps. P.S.- A lotta people noob tube, so dont hate em, join em. Its more fun
will this work on an indian ps vita? and is it in a game card?
I'm sure it's on a game card. Not sure about indian vita. Sorry.

Its ok but the controls are kind of needing to get use to
How bad is the violence and "Blood"? I have a 6 yr old dying to get this game, but I want to make sure it's appropriate. Please help.
This game has absolutely no blood and very little violence (cartoon sword slashing and fighting of the sort) and it's full of puzzles in which you could cooperate with your child to solve. It's good to develop those puzzle-solving skills and strengthen your bonds at the same time.
How does it differ from the original (game cube) game?
The new game has updated visuals and small tasks such as location of items changing. Otherwise the game is mostly the same from the original. Having played the game cube version I still strongly recommend picking this up if you have a wii u as it's a blast with replay.ability
Does this come with a booklet inside? I ask because I bought it used and there was nothing inside.
It comes with a club nintedo brochure and a paper that tells you how to access the electronic manual. The electronic manual can be accessed by pressing the home button while in-game and select the "?" symbol.
This or Super Smash Bros?
Both games are excellent. They are totally different kinds of games. If you are a solo player get zelda. If you like to play with friends get Smash. Also, although a very good game, zelda has low replay value compared to smash.
Is navigating through the sea as mind numbing and slow as it was for game cube? because if so, its a deal breaker!
To quote the Zelda Wiki: "Exclusive to The Wind Waker HD, the Swift Sail is an upgrade to the Sail that enables the King of Red Lions to sail faster. Also, the Swift Sail automatically changes the direction of the wind to the boat's heading, thus making the King of Red Lions sail at full speed in all directions. This eliminates the need to play the Wind's Requiem when sailing. The Swift Sail is activated by pressing the A button while the normal sail is deployed, and can be changed back to the normal sail by pressing A again. The upgrade is found at the Auction House on Windfall island after the completion of Dragon Roost Cavern.[1]" http://zeldawiki.org/Sail#Swift_Sail

what it is the model ps3 cech-xxxx? firmware? thanks
CECH-3001A, system software ver. 4.55. I couldn't find any firmware information sorry =(. But it's definitely a 1st generation slim. It has no "wi-fi" indicator in the front of the PS3. I'm very disappointed in this. The condition of it was unacceptable & horrible. Was very dirty & had noticeable dirt within the usb and back ports. I do not recommend buying from GoHastings.com ever!
Is this PS3 model backwards compatible?
No, PS2 backward compatibility was dropped after the software capability of the 80GB fat model. Hardware compatibility was only in the original 20 and 60 GB fat models.
I just received an item called : PlayStation 3 System Slim 120GB &amp; Controller (Black). I there is no controller included. So where is the controller?
If I was you I would contact the seller. If you are buying a used I team then it could have been human error on their end. If it is there fault, and they refuse to correct there mistake I would contact Amazon, and they will muscle the seller or make their life miserable for you. Amazon has an amazing customer service team.
Does this play ps2 and ps1 games?
No

Yes but no controller
is this a two player game?
The main game is single player. However there are special stages that can be played two player outside the main game. These two player stages are unlocked in single player, and consist of side scrolling platforming that gets challenging fast.
How many players?
1 player story mode 2 player arcade mode ( only after halfway beaten first world ) :O
Can you play whole game with just wiimote?
As far as I know yes
What controllers the sonic colors use
The regular wii remote is fine, the classic remote works also and is more comfortable in your hands.

Does this one give me Founder Status with the 8 Character slots, 4 bank slots and all, or do I need the Collector's edition instead for those benefit?
The key from the cd box is all you need for founders status. When entering the key remember to enter it backwards as well for an additional mount.
If i get a brand new edition will it come with the founder's code?
That it does. Additionally, you can enter the code backwards to get some additional goodies after you register your copy.
DRM type, no internet required?
you have to have internet to play this game. it's like WoW without the fee
Does the PC download version come with the codes? or do you actually have to purchase the physical copy which requires waiting for the shipping?
You need a physical copy
Is this the Veteran code which can make me have 8characters?
This indeed has the code for the "Founder" status that gives 8 character slots, full bank tab, a mout for each character. But beware as it's the code for the NA version for TERA enmasse, so if you want to code for enmasse get it, but if ur looking for the EUropean version it's not this one.
Is the mount Account wide or does it bind to only 1 char?
Account wide
Does anyone know where I enter the code on an existing account?
You should have an En Mass account for Tera. Go there , log in, click the "enter code" button on the right side of your account overview page. Enter and submit code.
I know that this code can make you Founder status but is this code fits the EU vision or just fits the enmasse vision?
US version only
Seems like it is for for the NA version for TERA enmasse? And who knows is this match the EU vision?
If the question is whether the NA version is the same as the EU version, the answer is yes....it is just a different set of servers and of course a different set of players. I have played on both and it is the same ga.e.
few records come from? to buy the game is installed with your disks and then I guess updates and patches are downloaded ?
Yes updates and patches are downloaded once you create an account and log in. Expect at least a few hours of patching on your first login since there have been quite a few big updates since the original release.
I played Gears of War 3 and liked the campaign. Should I give this game a try? Is it a must play for 360 owners? I am only interested in single player.
I'd say yes, especially if you are a fan of the series. It's pretty much on par with Gears 3 as far as graphics game play etc. I too only purchased it for the campaign mode. One thing judgement has is; you'll come to a variety of different types of side/bonus missions that are optional during the campaign. You'll know when you come to them, because there will be a red gears emblem on the wall, and they aren't hard to find. Walk up to it and you can either accept or deny if you want to play it. It's kinda like horde mode on online. You and the crew have to face usually two waves of various types of enemies. So it's kind of like a run and gun type of affair. You'll earn stars, badges, etc for completing/doing various things when playing them. So that adds to the campaign as well. I am very pleased with my purchase. I've only completed the first few chapters; because I bought 7 other games at the time. So I have a lot of love to spread around, lol. Another recommendation that I have for you is Tomb Raider if you haven't played it already. That's where most of my gaming time is spent. It's a very good game, and I highly recommend it. I'm playing it on the ps3 however. I would definitely recommend Gears judgment as well since you are a fan of the series. I noticed the other answers were short, so I tried to provide additional information to help you out with your decision. Hope this helps with determining whether you purchase it or not. You won't be disappointed though...
comes in Spanish?
No sorry
I have a 4GB xbox 360e but I have a 36GB flash drive do I need a hard drive to play this game
Not necessarily. For this game, as long as you have the room for saving the content, then it'll play smoothly for you. :]
Can I still enjoy it as a purely single player experience (for the price)?
Yes. Good story line. Kicks butt as much as others.
can you play two player mode without going on line?
Yes
Does this game have a private" warzone" setting where you can fight 3 on 3, 5 on 5, etc like the prior versions? Thanks.
If you would like to play private matches you can, however if you are looking to play a game mode like war zone that is like the previous Warzone & other modes from the past games you are kind of out of luck as they have changed the mechanics of the game so much that you do not even get down anymore. To sum it up you will not have an opportunity to experience the type of game playing you are you still from any of the three previous titles.
does this game really suck ballls
Yes it does. Trust me.
is this game have bots??as in i can face computer players without going online??
Yes
Does it work well with the PS3?
Yes
Has anyone had success using this on a workstation Avaya phone (with an adapter) in a call center environment?
No this only works on a pc or console
How long are the cords? I have a 70 inch TV and sit about 15 ft away from the TV. Are the cords long enough for this?
The cords are not 15 feet. I would say they are closer to 10
Is this a wireless headset?
This particular model is NOT a wireless headset
If I plug the green cable in to my iPod touch, will I get sound?
Just did it to mine. Yes. Beautiful sound.
Do i plug the 3.5mm cable in the mic or headset port on my PC?
Head set port.
Does this headset have a button to mute the microphone? If so where is it located?
Yes it has one take your headset and go about half way down the cord and there is a little box it will have a red or green light on it if it's green the Mic is on and if the light is red it should be off its easy.
Will this work for MacBook Pro (2014)?
Yes they work on Mac.
How long is the cord?
12 foot cable length and 3.5 mm plug for line input. Here you go. Hope it helps
is it good for hearing the steps in black ops? please be honest
Yes, you can also hear the clicking of guns as they are being reloaded.
Is the game worth the price?
I bought this game near the release date for full price. I don't regret paying what I did and now that it's much cheaper I wouldn't pass it up. :)
is this a 2 players simultaneous game
No. It is only 1 player.
Is the story line or jobs any different compared to the version that is out for the Nintendo DS 3D?
Yes. The story in the 3DS game is a prequel to the Wii U game.
hi, can we play this on the wii mini?
No, just the new wii u system.
is this playable with the wii u pro controller ?
If you could it would ruin the game. This game, better than any other I've played, takes full advantage of the game pad. You would not want to play this with the pro controller if you could. I don't think it is possible anyway.
What do you do after the game?
Like any of the LEGO games you can go back and get 100% completion. There is a lot of replay value here as going back to finish the game out and find all the extra bricks, characters, cars etc. is what makes it more enjoyable after the fact. I found the story to be fantastic and obviously from my review, I rate this game very highly.
Does it support off-tv play, meaning can you play with only the Gamepad and not the tv screen?
No... unfortunately not. Gamepad is used as a device by your character in the game
is this appropriate for 6 year olds
Absolutely! It is a super fun, appropriate for all ages game.
Is this game free roam like other Lego games?
It is the ultimate free roam. Better than any other Lego game. It is the ultimate a d aweso.email 1 player adveture! My most desired sequel, and I never even liked Lego games before this. Buy it and enjoy!
How to safe game and start next time from same point?
It auto saves. If you're in the world, you'll just start back at the police station. There are checkpoints in all the missions.

Will this work with the PS4 ?
all Move products will work with both PS3 AND PS4
I don't understand the difference between the "PS3 Motion Controller" and "PS3 Navigation Controller" --When would you use one over the other?
The Motion controller is more or less the PS3's equivalent to a Wii Remote since it's the main peripheral aside from the Playstation Eye that's required for all PSMove games. That makes the Navigation Controller the PS3's Nunchuck since it's a largely optional side-peripheral that's only used in conjunction with the motion controller/remote for movement (Notably in Resistance and Killzone 3's PSMove modes) or additional off-hand motions (ex. pulling the bowstring in Sports Champions' Archery or as the shield in Gladiator Combat) in most games.
Does the stick have a input for pressing in?
Yes the stick functions as a button as well.
Is this PC compatible?
I know you can plug them into the usb and pc will detect and charge but if there is anything that I know of that may help is the controller software called motionjoy. Best of luck. Will tell you I am not positive that this will solve your problem but a decent place to start.
Will this work with the PC? I'm disabled and need something like this for the PC.
No I'm sorry it's only for play station 3
Works in PS4??
Excellet product
Does it come with the charger?
No
Is it best to have two move controllers, or one controller with this move navigation controller?
If you are the only one playing, one is enough. It all depends on the number of possible people playing. We're a family of 3, so we bought 3.
does this connect wirelessly or does it come with the cable to connect to the ps3 just cause i just purchased a ps3 and have no idea what i need.
All my controllers are wireless and it is wise to buy the set to the move controllers. The numb chuck is also a must have because you need it to use with bow and arrows, and some guns or riffles
Could I just use my previously purchased remote controller instead of this navigation controller?
Yes

Why are you selling a game that doesn't work anymore? This is highly misleading and quite frankly dishonest.
A little extra clarification for the only other answer: the original Final Fantasy XIV did not do well critically and was basically scrapped/pulled offline. The game was given to a new development team for improvements and re-released under the title "Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn" in 2013. I do not know for sure that this game does not "work" anymore or that it won't automatically upgrade to A Realm Reborn, but if you are considering buying it then it's probably a good idea to purchase Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn to be safe. Also for potential buyers: please note that A Realm Reborn is NOT an expansion--you do not need to buy this in order to play A Realm Reborn.
If I get this one, will it update to ARR or is that a seperate game altogether?
You should be able to upgrade for free to ARR. However, in order to avoid any oddities, since you wouldn't have an existing account, simply purchase the FFXIV: ARR for convenience.
Does this come with one disc or two (The game disc and the Eorzea The making of a realm disc)?
One disk, but, good luck getting help activating the game. Square Enix is really bad with their customer Support. I've had this game for over a year and still can not get it activated.
Do you know if it has the Garmond Goggles Code or is of the first batch?
think the goggles were an item you had to quest or so. All I can find out is if you had them in 1.0 it carries over into ARR. Does it just give them to you for buying the game, the answer is as far as I can see. No. The goggles themselves are actually a EU 1.0 Preorder bonus. http://xivdb.com/?item/2632/Garlond-Goggles
does this game still work and can you play it on windows
Yes it is a NEW game designed for modern computers and works fine on XP, and later versions of windows. This is NOT one of the older Final Fantasy titles. It is an online MMO that uses modern technology.
how good are the graphics? will it take full advantage of my HD 7870 ghz 2gb?
Hello, and I have played Final Fantasy XIV now for over nine months, and have two characters up to level 50, and it is superb in terms of graphics. It will soar with your system and you will be amazed at how well it is designed and how beautiful it all is. You will be able to use the highest settings, the system is so well balanced that with hundreds of thousands of players spread out over scores of servers, it has no lag at all. Enjoy.
I don't have a starcraft 2 account before, can i only buy the heart of swarm to start the game?
It states that the base game is required to play this expansion pack, so you must buy Wings of Liberty to be able to play Heart of the Swarm.
works windows 8.1?
Yes, very well!
Is there a way to redeem this through battle.net after I order so I can DL and start playing or do I have to wait for the physical copy to arrive?
You need the activation code from the disk.
I'm buying this for my boyfriend and I'm clueless, is buying the collectors edition worth it? What weight does it hold?
It really depends on if he also plays Diablo 3 or World of Warcraft. Collectors editions come with bonuses for all 3 of those games. For example, this one would give his D3 characters special wings & also an in-game pet for WoW.
I have a Mac Mini i5 2.3. It's ok to play it?
I use a Mac Mini i5 2.5GHz with 8GB RAM. The game plays great for me, though I've only ran it on low settings. Out of all Blizzard games, SC2 plays the smoothest on my Mac. It should play fine on your machine, but recommended RAM is 4GB (2GB minimum). I'd go to at least the 4GB if you haven't already.
Does this come with the Baneling pet?
Sorry :/ just the box with the game inside
If you buy used does it come with a valid activation code?
Only if it's never been opened....you pretty much need to buy it new.
Does the latest version of 13 inch retina 128GB works for this game?
Yes it does, though I wouldn't recommend trying to run the graphics on Ultra/Extreme on anything with a less than 2.6Ghz processor same as Wings of Liberty. However you can still run graphic on High you might be able to get away with Ultra if your Graphics card is good enough.
How many hours does it take to play this game from start to finish?
Depends on what your goal is. If you're just playing through the game normally, it could take a couple/few hours. 100% completion is a different story...
Why is this game $67.99?? This game is 2.5 years old and all new games are based at $60....
It's most likely because Nintendo is no longer having new copies of this game printed. Once a game goes out of print, it's value as a new, sealed copy tends to increase.
how many star coins are there
probably 5 star
is this game enjoyable as a single player or does it need multiple players to be fun?
I haven't tried it as single player but it is an option. I believe it would be fine as single player. Some of my partners were so lame I might as well have been playing alone.
Can this game be played on the original wii system
No, it can only be played on the Wii U
Does this use the classic controller?
No you can't use the classic controller with this. But you can with Mario Kart 8.
Can I use this game with the GamePad or i need another controller?
You can play one player with it, but to play four players you need controllers. You can still use the gamepad as a fifth player but cannot use any characters in game.
My kids love Super Mario 3D World, is this as good?
In my opinion super mario 3d world is superior but this game is still a pretty fun game, especially when playing with others.
Can you play multiplayer (2 people) with 2 Wii U Pro Controllers?
yes you can, the only combination isnt available is using two gampads
Is the gamepad required, or can I play this with a Wiimote only?
You can use any mix of gamepad, wiimote, and WiiU pro.
How many hours does it take to play this game from start to finish?

Can this mouse be configured with the Logitech Gaming Framework? I want its profile to change automatically for each program.
I'm not familiar with their the Logitech gaming framework. But with the set point driver installed you can customize an unlimited amount of profiles saved on your computer and the profile will be loaded for whichever program has focus. if the program does not have a profile the general profile is used. this all happens on the fly behind the scenes.
Does this mouse have volume control?
it has programmable buttons which I assume could be used for that....but I'm not 100% certain.
How much does this mouse weigh when the weights are taken out?
G500 without the Weight Cartridge tray is 161 g (5.68 ounce) and with the Weight Cartridge tray empty is 164 g (5.78 ounce). G500 technical specs: http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14191
How does this mouse compare to the original G5? I have been using the G5 for 5+ years now but may need a upgrade.
Hi, I only saw your reply today hence the late reply. Maybe it's just me but the G500 is too bulky and the build quality is lower than the G5 in my opinion, for example when you click the mouse button it feels slightly loose on the G500. In my opinion, the G500 is not the mouse to upgrade to. I'm not sure which mouse to go to tbh. Right now I using the G5 again and the G500 is in the drawer.
Is this mouse larger than a G 400 or what is the length &amp; width please?
I haven't used the G400 but judging by the pictures, they look to be the same size. Since the mouse is curvy, I measured the length and width at the longest and widest points on the base of the mouse: 12 cm by 7 cm
Hey guys I was wondering how quiet this mouse is? Are the clicks very loud at night? thx
I don't feel it's all that loud but if you are gaming and repeatedly mashing the mouse button hard and fast in a completely silent house I am sure that it could disrupt someone from sleep but I think most mice would do that. This has been my all time fave mouse I have bought 4 of them and been the most happy with both the shape and the way you can weight it to be the right feel for you.
How long is the cable? Is it braided?
The cable is 2 meters (6.6 ft) long, and is braided. It looks nice.
Does this mouse work with Win 8? Having trouble programming G400 buttons?
According to Logitech's own website, they completely support your mouse on the Windows 8 platform (source: http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/32425#Mice) You would program your mouse's macro buttons using the 'Mouse and Keyboard Settings' program that comes with the Logitech drivers package. The program may also be called and titled, 'Logitech SetPoint'.
Button 10 (left side, red square) Has anyone gotten this to work on games?
The only way to do it is to set a macro and just set to a key on your keyboard and set the action to that key in game. Windows doesn't seem to recognize the button.
Anyone used this with a KVM switch? Logitech's web site doesn't commit either way; it says "KVM switches may affect the functionality of your G500."
I only used my KVM with my MX518, and that worked fine. I can't say I ever used a KVM with my G500 though(left click switch went bad in under 1 year btw, I just bought the G700). I suspect the KVM switch would not effect the standard functionality. Any lack of operation would probably be more specific to the KVM's quality or compatibility with the mouse due to voltage or signal loss through the KVM.
Does it work with Windows 8?
Yes
Does this work with OS X Lion?
I'm not sure if it work with OS X Lion but I can test it out for you. I know for sure it works for OS X Snow Leopard because that is what I'm using it with. I have OS X Lion on my iMac but never tried playing it on it. I can give it a go a little later on today and get back to you. I will edit this answer once I give it a try.
Has anyone tried hooking two of these up to a computer for two player games?
Yes! It works perfectly!!! And the cord is a good length. I need to get a second one so I can play head to head with people
Does it work with OS X Yosemite 10.10.1?
I don't know I use it on windows 7 and snes9x is the emulator I use it works perfectly on that
When trying to map the D-Pad, I can't seem to register the up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right. Is the SNES controller not 8 directional?
Nope, but works perfect in the 4 directional configuration. No complains about it.
For some reason every time i plug in the controler it says that it does not recognize the controler and it won't work. What do i do?
Your emulator should have an input mapping feature that you can use to calibrate towards.
will this work with a Hp Pavillion Beats laptop windows 8?
This controller is pretty much a plug n play controller, depending on what you want it for.. If you're gonna use it for a SNES or NES emulator, it will work perfectly as it's just to plug in, set controls and you're done, just like a regular gamepad. I use Windows 7 myself, but as it's plug n play, it will most probably work for Windows 8 OS too.
Does this work with GameBoy/GameBoy Color/GameBoy Advanced? Does this act as a keyboard by using normal keyboard signals?
No. It doesn't work at all. Doesn't ship with a driver, windows 7 and 8 cannot find a driver, and i couldn't find one on google that would work. It's nothing but a paperweight.
Does it work with Linux?
Yes
Will this SNES Controller work for Star Wars The Old Republic PC games?
If there is a button setup in the game, then maybe. I use it with an emulator. So not sure.
What's the difference between the Standard and the 2013 edition besides $50?
The laser and the battery life, most importantly, the battery life. The old model lasted a couple hours tops.
Is this the 6400dpi found on the Razer website?
No its not. That is the 2013 model. They arent selling them on amazon yet. This is the older model.
is the backlight blue or green?
Blue
ambidextrous
Yes, this mouse is ambidextrous. Both sides of the mouse are a mirror image across the central axis. Be warned that it's hard to click the side buttons with your pinky. Well, it's easy to click them, but hard to click them on purpose.
left-handed
Yeah, the mouse is completely symmetrical and has two buttons on each side, the built in software should let you switch it over depending on your preference
will this work with android since its bluetooth?
Sorry for the late response, I had to wait for my son to answer this. He believes it should, but you might need to google for more information. He uses as a bluetooth and wired and says it is an excellent mouse for gaming and photo shop, etc. Very responsive, no lagging. Thank you
come with blue tooth dongle: Does this mouse come with a blue tooth dongle?
NO! It's for BlueTooth equipped devices.
Scrolling: Is it smooth scrolling or are there notches?
I cannot speak for the brand new model, but the one pictured here does have 'notched' scroll wheel. It is very responsive.
wheel

Which Scrabble game will work well with Windows 7 64bit computers? Has anyone had success with a Scrabble game on Windows 7?
Scrabble Plus works perfectly on Windows 7-64 bit.
Does this work with Windows 8? We have a not-so powerful desktop running on Windows 8 and have concerns about it working. Any advice?
Yes, it does.
Does this have a bigger board? An older person wants this and said that she's tried a couple Scrabble games and the board is really tiny.
No. I'm in my twenties and wear glasses and I found it too small for my taste.
will it work on laptop windows 8
It works on my desktop running window 7, so I assume it would work on version 8. Try it it's cheap enough.
Can you play on line with friends
No, I never played online. I'm very frustrated when I've played Scrabble Plus to the extent that I hardly play anymore. The game allows your opponent to use illegal Scrabble words which you have no way of challenging. I've gotten to the point when this happens, I quit the game. I love the game and I like to play by the rules.
do I need to leave the disc in the computer to play this scrabble game?
No, you can load it onto your computer and then remove the disk.
after I download the game do I still need to have the CD in to play it?
No
can you play random on line opponents?
I don't know. I really don't much care for the game. The graphics are bad and the playing levels aren't what I had hoped.
will this scrabble work on windows 8.1?
Yes.... I have it on my computer
does it run well in Windows 7
Yes
Will the software work on windows 7 ?
Yes
Is it a reductions version of all 3 AOEIIIs, or a better and expansion of AOEIIIs?
It contains all three versions. The original, warchiefs and asian dynasties. The same if you bought all three seperately. Nothing added and nothing removed when combining the three. There is a campain story that flows through all three but Asian Dynasties is the best with the more options and the acrive online multiplayer scene. There you can play with friends or on your own against computers, against other people or custom maps such as free for all.
Did everyone find a cd key?
I already had one from my cd pack was just missing a couple CDs
Could you tell me if this comes with all expansions for Age of Empires 3?
yes i am positive i bought it. u have 0 worries.
Will the software work on windows 8 ?
It does work on windows 8. No issues
Are the download option includes AOE II also? Or only AOE III ?
Includes I, II, and III
Does this have any copy protection software?
I don`t know for sure but I think so.
Is this made in USA?
Label on mine says it was made in Europe. Below that it indicates the UK.
Is this made in USA?
Your question is a little incomplete, actual creation of the game? Or the missions within the game?
Can I play AOE III without an internet connection?
absolutely - you don't need an Internet connection
Am I right when I see that there are two (2) controlers for $12.50 price?
Yup! And they are in great condition :) they were still I those cases and fit in the wii slots just like it says
can i use this with the wii u adapter
Yes, but buyer beware, the left joy sick rubber WILL come off after useing for a while. I play ssbb and they only lasted a month.
Do these controllers directly plug in to the Wii?
yes
Do you get two controllers from this order or one?
I received two controllers. They were in two separate packages as seen on the picture.
HOw do you connect this to the Wii, my son's console does not have a slot matching the plug on this unit
If you have a Wii U, then the console doesn't have slots for gamecube controllers. However, Nintendo recently came out with an adaptor that you could pick up at your local gamestop or toys'r'us. If you have a regular Wii, then the slots are on the top of the console behind a flap.
Do these controllers have a logo on them? or are they unbranded? I'm filming a music video and I need unbranded controllers. Thanks!
unbrand
Is this legit?
this is the 3rd party made controller for gamecube games.
Does it still come with two?
Yeah
When I plugged my controllers into the sockets on my Wii I still can't navigate the menu or click anything. Anybody know what is wrong?
You can't control the Wii menu with a GameCube controller, it has to be a Wii remote
Does this product work and if so how does it hold up to light/moderate use?
Yes, not bad for moderate use.

Dose it work with PS4 Thanks
Hi, I do not have a PS4 but from what I've read on the internet there are compatibility issues of PS3 remote with the PS4, so this may not work on PS4. You could email the manufacturer at -pcsupport@smkusa.com - to get a specific reply. Hope this helps.
The time warner cabke code does not work. Are there other codes?
If you can't find a code after doing a code search, use the Learning feature to program the remote to the box.
What is the code for xbox 360?
No
Can you use it to change channels if you have time warner cable box?
Yea u can record the buttons from tha remote u got from with your box http://youtu.be/ULQTU2RAQOY
Will it replace my Roku remote ?
I'm sure it could, as long as the remote learns the signal from the Roku remote.
Does it require my original tv remote or can I program it to my tv using codes?
Does not require your original TV remote unless you need to program specific buttons to your universal remote.
Will this remote work with my Onkyo HTR320 using remote controller RC-479S? Thanks ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)
Yes
Has anyone used with a Channel Master DVR?
I don't think so but don't quote me
Will it work with comcast xfinity cable box?
Yes
Is this a line of sight remote or can the signal go thru a wall?
Line of sight for rf devices but bluetooth for ps3 connection goes through the wall.
Does the game fill the screen? The version by another maker that I have does not. My resolution is 1366X758 on a lap top.
No! It does not fill the screen, and they make it as difficult Each time you want to play, that to go Thur it all , it's not worth it. From now on I will only buy pop cap games!
Will this run on Windows XP?
I'm running it on Windows 7 - But the jewel case DOES list Windows XP (and not Windows 7 - imagine that) - So I assume it will run on your XP machine just fine.
Moraff requires a code number to get their discs to work. Is code number included in jewel case.
I did not have to enter a number when I loaded the disc (downloaded it in December).
Will Majongg 3 run on 8.1?
Yes. I got it to install on my 8.1 and it seems to be working just fine. Hope you find that helpful.

Sorry, but I don't have windows 8.
will this game work with windows 7
Yes
will this game work with windows 7
yes. My system is 64-bit windows 7 and it works very well.
will this work on XBox 360 Kinect'???
It hooks to the back of your xbox 360 only
Greetings, I have X-BOX 360 KINETIC LIMITED EDITION, 320 GB White Color, Star Wars Edition. Kindly advise if the fan will work on the above model of the X-Box. This is not a slim X-Box, White in Color. Also advise if the power of the fan needs to be...
I purchased that cooling fan for my Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Edition 320GB XBox 360, and it did not fit
Is there an adapter so it will work with the new Xbox360?
Its not this one. try any of the black exterior fan styles. There was this really cool one I was looking at before I sold mine. Nyko Intercooler STS for Xbox 360
can I equip the cooling fans and my hardrive on the xbox at the same time?
no and it only fits the old white Xbox, with the square looking plug
Does this work on xbox 360 slim
no the slim has got a built in cooling fan in it.thank you.
How can I fix it please?
that really depends on just how it might have broken. if it simply " died", you might have a serious short in which it isnt repairable at all ( most likely given the design ). i do have this, have it on my old xbox, so i havent had an issue with it. if possible to open it up, you might have a short in a wire leading into the unit, or from the power source inlet leading to the fans. without having tried to repair, i can only guess. being three fans, if it all died, i would think that a wire coming from the power inlet into the unit is at fault. sorry, hard to diagnose without actually working on the unit, maybe someone else can help more.
What's the lsize of the case? I want to make sure it fits my 3ds XL
Approx 8 inches by 8 inches, it will definitely fit your 3ds xl and then some. Inside the bag is an inner pouch that will fit your 3ds xl vertically, there is a detachable Velcro divider inside which you can remove to fit you 3ds xl horizontally, the additional space is supposed to be for a car charger. Either way there is plenty of room for your 3dsxl.
Are the cartridge slots able to fit 3DS games without any issues? Because of the obvious cartridge differences between DS and 3DS.
Yes
HI, for 2ds???
I'm not sure. My son has used it for his DSi and his 3DS, so I'm thinking yes, but can't promise.
I wonder if the black one is just like the pink one ?
I bought the blue/teal one. It does look like the black one but I do not know if it is like the pink one or not.
does the black case have Mario on it?
The case I purchased did not come with Mario on it.
Does the black case actually have Mario on the front?
unknown, sorry Ms Seal, purchased as gift & sent from Amazon
Anybody tried plugging the hdmi plug into something other than an xbox? (please dimwit, don't tell me what it was made for). I want just audio out
This does not go into the xbox's HDMI port at all. It goes into the proprietary A/V out plug.
Will this work with the Xbox 360 slim ?
Yes
Would this cable work if I use it with my HDTV to plug an audio cable from my speakers?
I'm not sure I understand he question but to give you an answer this cable is used for xbox only. You connect one end to the xbox and the other end to your sound system. Hope this answer your question.
Can this be used simultaneously alongside an HDMI cable? (Can I have this plugged into my Xbox SLIM at the same time as an HDMI cable)
Yes I used it for my older turtle beach headset. And used the hdmi for picture and sound on my tv.
Does this adapter plug into the controller or the actual Xbox 360? The port in the photo looks different then the port on our wireless controller?
this works only for an xbox 360 that has a HDMI port for graphics, and an open slot for audio into which you need to plug in headphones, but is only that trapezoidal shape so you can't sync your headphones up without this adapter. There were some transitional models with this issue. If you don't have a trapezoidal hole in the back of your xbox, OR you aren't needing miked headphones, then you don't need this.
Is this a special 360 HDMI connector or would this work with other devices that have HDMI?
It is specific to only the 360. It works great, I am using it right now.
Someone please tell me where the fat end of this thing plugs in! PLEASE HELP!
This goes to an Xbox 360 Slim. If look on this page (http://hdfanatic.com/2010/07/08/xbox-360-250gb/) there is a picture of the back of the Slim. The fat end goes in the A/V Port. I hope this helps.
Is this a good product to buy im using Mad Catz headphones ?
Yes
What's the length of this cable? I need a long one to connect my xbox to projector (on ceiling) to sound bar (at seating level)
It's like 6 inches approximately. Sorry man.
will this work for turtle beaches on the xbox one or only 360?
Im not sure about the turtle beaches, it worked for my after glow. I think it should work on the beaches too.
Does the LED light always stay on? Is there a way to turn it off?
Razer has a free downloadable program called Razer Synapse that allows configuration of the mouse, Including the lights. The Wheel light and logo light can be toggled off individually. There's also an option to toggle all lighting to off when system displays are turned off
is the mouse small?
It is decently sized. My hands are large and it feels comfortable.
Hello, I wonder if this is the blue model?
yeah it is, it matches the blue lights on my keyboard very well!
Is this a chroma?
No
which version is this
I'm not sure
does this mouse work for mac ?
Yes
how long was the warranty of this mouse
The mouse has a 2 year warranty. http://www.razerzone.com/warranty scroll down to see the chart.
Can this mouse be used as an ambidextrous mouse? I use my left hand to surf the internet and control my computer and use my right hand for gaming.
It's a right handed design, it's not confortable to use with your left hand, the shape of the mouse and the button placement would make it very odd. Razer has some ambidextrous options
Is it eligible for a laptop?
Yup shouldn't have any issues.
My palm is a little bit big, so I just wanna know this one is small,mid,or big size? Tip: I am a "mouse clicker"
Think of it as about the same size of the average Microsoft/Dell mouse you would get with a store-bought desktop computer, with a little bit more height (very little difference). I'd call it midsize, personally.
is skate 3 popular
well, of course, many popular YouTubers play this game, such as: PewdiePie,jacksepticeye,Markiplierm,TheGamingLemon, and many more YouTubers.
Should I play skate 1&amp;2 before Skate 3? I usually like to play games in order but I only have $40 to spend. Thank you in advance if you answer.
No, there's really no story to the Skate series, just better gameplay and graphics. I'd say it would be great for you to skip the first two games and decide on Skate 3 instead. It's a great game, and definitely better than the other games!
Is their a difference with skate 3 platinum hits and regular skate 3, besides the price?
There is no difference.
what it the difference between this one and the other one for 35
Skate 2?
why teen
Why is this game rated "T" for Teen? I think it's because there's minor swearing with words like 'hell' and 'damn'. There's also mild violence, crude humor, drug references from time to time, and suggestive themes. (I got those off the back of game where it says what you can expect to see in the game.) Hope this helps! :)
It is rated T for language. What words are used that are inappropriate for kids? Thanks.
I think its ok.
Isn't this the Skate game that has all those hilarious glitches?
Yes
is the become a skate mogol mode only online or is it also available for single player?
Both
Should I play skate 1&amp;2 before Skate 3? I usually like to play games in order but I only have $40 to spend and my friend was telling me about how awes
There is no story line to follow. Skate 3 has better graphics and more detail. My advice--spend your $40 on Skate 3.
Does this keyboard use Cherry MX keys and if so which color?
No it's not mechanical, just a regular gaming keyboard but ive used it for almost 2 years and its still going strong for me in ways similar to that of a mechanical keyboard
Durability of keycap coating? Has there been any improvement regarding the coating and paint on the keycaps to prevent wear and tear?
I've had my keyboard for probably about a year and I have not noticed any of the keys showing wear. I use it daily.
Key spamming: Can the programmable keys on this keyboard be programmed to spam the keys while holding it down?
Yes they can. They can also be programmed as a "toggle" which means the key will continue to be sent without any action on your part until you toggle it off by pressing it again.
Does the keyboard come in the original box sealed, with everything in it like the software?
Unfortunately no, I was pretty disappointed.
Does the variable volume control work with Windows media player?
The volume control calls the system volume of the default output, not the active application.
I process orders using the same key strokes over and over again. can this keyboard be programmed to repeat key strokes with the press of one key?
Yes
how many concurrent keys can you press before it stops recognizing keys?
It's at least 4. 5 may be pushing the limits.
Why does't the diferent colors work with windows 8 ?
There seem to be some compatability issues with Windows 8. Firstly, make sure you are using the correct software (32, 64 bit); it is available for download from Logitech's website. 32 bit is included on a CD with the keyboard. Make sure to completely uninstall the software to ensure a clean install from the manufacturers website.
Is the Palm rest removable?
Usually. In my case I didn't get one because it was used, but if you get it new it should come with a removable palm rest.
Is this made in China?
Yes it is. What isn't made in China lol.
can I hook up a original NES controller on the RES?
Yes
How long are the cables? The distance from my TV to couch is 8 feet. I know I won't have a problem with the Original NES, not sure about this one.
They aren't very long. We have to sit on the floor to play or pull a chair close to the game system.
how well would it work on a samsung flat screen tv?
Not to sure. U might have to get a rca to hdmi converter if the picture is blurred or bounces.
I heard if you played the original NES this system has a slight delay compared to it, have you noticed this delay (if any) and if so is it noticeable?
i haven't noticed any noticeable delay.this system is very glitchy, keep in mind that the games have age as well. this system is cool but very, very poor quality.
is it portable?
Yes it is portable . Take it right back where you bought it from .if its like mine a piece of junk.worked literally one time . Sitting in my shed now can't get money back don't have the heart to throw away.
Does this hook up directly to a TV via coaxial cable, or does it require an RF converter box?
To the tv
Hi how are you :) does this fit Super Nintendo games? Thank you!
No it does not bot there is a version of this console that does it's the snes retro.
Is it a bad thing to buy?
Ours works perfectly.
Can this play and use every game and controller made for the original nes?
I have Mario bros the first 1 and the 2nd and the 3rd. Along with duck hunt and Dr mario. They all play great. I don't know about being able to use the original game controllers. The ones that come with the system are great.
Dose it play all Nes games are is it it wierd with them
Hello, You need the cartidges to play. It does not come with preloaded games.
who's the manufacturer exactly...?

why can't i hear any sounds while playing the game?
You have to go to the manufacturer's website, and download a patch. Mine worked fine after that.
was the game fun
I haven't tried it yet. I just got it...by the end of the day I can let you know :)
Does this work with Sims 2 Double Deluxe? Because I got the regular Pets one, and it did not.
It should work with double deluxe, so should your old copy of pets. I'm not sure why your original copy of pets didn't work tbh. If you have further questions or need assistance from some real Sim experts try modthesims.info They have faqs and forums where you can get answers about your Sims games.
Does it work on windows 7?
Yes
does it play on mac?
No you have to buy the Mac version of the game
Does it play in a mac laptop?
Yes, it plays just fine on a Mac.
Does it work on a laptop with windows 8.1?
NO!!!!! None of these games have the same system connection to play on a Windows 8,laptop or PC. I have tried and had to send the games back.
How many batteries is included? 1 or 2?
Just 1
How many batteries is included? 1 or 2?
It comes with only one battery.
Will this work with the energizer charging station?
These are intended for use with Nyko's dual charger which does not require removing the batteries from the controllers to charge them. You just set the controller directly on the charger. They also work just fine with charge and play cables so it's a pretty safe assumption that they will work with the PDP/Energizer charger, too, since it connects to the same port. They will also work with any standalone charger that requires the battery to be removed from the controller. I've been using them for years and they have held up very well.
Are batteries required?
This is a rechargable battery. You will either need an Xbox 360 recharge base, or a play-and-charge kit to recharge the battery; both sold seperately.
Will they work with the Xbox 360 Quick Charge Kit (2 battery stand up charging base)?
Yes, I use mine and they charge fine but I yhink they take a little longer.
Would this work for the XBOX 360 Quick Charge kit the one with (2 battery stand up charging base)
Yes
is this compatable with wii U?
Yes and it works well. You hook it to the regular wiimote instead of a nunchuck. It seemed weird but i just set the wiimote in my lap or on the table beside me.
WIll these classic controllers when plugged into the wii remote, be compatible with Smash brothers?
I can say mine did and I have a couple of their games to include mario party's
is this controller wireless
No, u have to connect it to the wii remote
Does this work for Wii games if playing on a Wii U? (for example Xenoblade Chronicles)
Yes I does and your better off with it than the wiimote
Will this work with Wii U titles?
Some
There's any Disc-Based Wii game compatible with this controller that doesn't support the GameCube controller?
Yes, there are. For example, Xenoblade Chronicles.
Do all wii games compatible whit this controller are also compatible whit the game cube controllers?
The Wii Classic Controller Pro is mostly for Virtual Console games, and the GameCube controllers are only for GameCube games being played on the Wii.
The original 'Classic' controller can't be used with Super Mario Brothers for the Wii. Will this controller work with Super Mario Brothers Wii?
No
Can you use this controller to play GameCube games on the Wii? Something like Soul Calibur 2?
No, it only works for the Wii...
Is it fun to play with on multiplayer games
No
Do these expire? That sounds like a stupid question, but I just got an Xbox Live membership card in December, so I won't need to update until next yr
No the card doesn't expire until you enter the code then it is like a normal membership after a year is up then you need a new one and they are stackable so you could buy it now and save it till the last day of your membership then add it and it would combine them
Why is the game card cheaper than the online code? You would think when factoring in the cost of delivery and the materials it would be about the same
Here's my hunch: 1. Microsoft doesn't want any online codes being sold for much cheaper than they're selling them, so they maintain pretty strict control over the price (i.e. it's the same everywhere). 2. When retailers sell the physical cards, they typically sell it for the card face value. Since they have inventory and distribution costs for this and still want to make a profit off of the sales, Microsoft still has to sell the cards to retailers at a lower price, say $20 less. 3. Amazon or its vendors get a similar deal as brick-and-mortar retailers on these cards, but they have lower costs than brick-and-mortar stores. So they can afford to sell these cards at a lower price than face value, and it ends up being lower price than the online codes. The economic incentives are all wrong here, and sadly until Microsoft and other vendors properly take this into account, there will continue to be wasteful distribution of physical cards when selling an electronic code is better for everyone.
if I buy 2 of these, and entered both codes, do I get a 2 years subscription ? or do I have to store the other code until the first one expires?
You are correct you would have a 2 year subscription. You can pre-load a total of 3 years.
what is the difference between card and online game code?
Online game code just gives you the code rather then shipping you the physical card, so if you want to play right now rather then wait 3 days or more then do that.
My xbox recognizes code but says there is an issue. My subscription doesn't run out till tomorrow, is that why I can't download it now?
It's possible, but then again, I've entered a code before my membership ended and it still went through. Then it automatically renewed the next day. I wouldn't know for sure though. There's a very slim chance that the code you received is invalid and the only way to find out for sure is to call Xbox Live Support or go on the website.
We are buying 1 XBox console &amp; we have 2 sons. Do we have to buy 2 Live memberships for them to both play online or can we just buy 1??
You can have them share an account. Only thing is that you can't have them both signed in at the same time, so if they wanted to do 2 player online then it would be better to have 2 online accounts
This item is only avalaible for costumers located in the U.S, so I am, but I want to gift this code to a friend in Venezuela, will work for him?
I don't see Venezuela listed on the XBox site, as one which is able to use live. However, a google search does show members stating they have access to it. I would check with your friend and ask if he's been able to use it in the past, before assuming it'll work. Although, if it won't work for him, you could always add it to your own account....so all is not lost. http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/countries
People, I am from URUGUAY and i was wondering if ONLINE GAME CODE (GOLD MEMBERSHIP) would work properly in my country. Thanks
I do not believe that Uruguay is a supported country. You could have an account in a supported region however and use the code. Hope that helps!
Will the code work internationally? Like all over the world?
Yes. It should

How do I know if this drive is the correct on for my Wii console?
If you have one of the original white WII unit, this is the correct DVD player for you. You will need the special hex like tool. It is not a Phillips head.
will this drive play gamecube games?
Yes, it will play gamecube games. It will play anything the original drive would.
will it work with the newer wii plus?
No
Is this compatible with the new WII U units?
I'd have to say no on this one. This is for the regular "Wii" units. The "Wii U" is Nintendo's next gen system. Other than the compatibility issues the form factor of the "Wii U" is different from the "Wii".
Was this drive tested against dual-layer discs (Smash Brawl, Metroid Trilogy, etc)?
We don't have the metroid trilogy, however it worked as expected with Smash Bros Brawl. So far it has read everything we threw at it that is supposed to play on the wii.
my model is RVL-001. is this compatible and dose this play Movie DVD?
It's compatible with all models. This drive is capable of reading the medium but there is no player. Wii does not include DVD playback software. You can only play video DVDs on a modded unit.
does the new drive mess with the old memory
No, the kids have told me everything was still the same.
Does this come with drive motor and drive laser?
This is the complete drive. You simply swap the old one out with this one. All drive components are included.
will this driver play dvd movies as well my wii didnt play dvd movies that i know of its the white wii with serial number lu105657406/ top na72mgef
The drive will act exactly as the previous one did no new capabilities that I know of. This is to replace a burned out drive in a nintendo Wii.
Will this drive work in a black wii circa 2011?
I cannot say for sure whether it will our not, but I will tell you that the drive I got only worked for about a month before it went out.
what is the difference for play station network card and the play station store card
There are two possible cards from playstation. From what you describe the ones you mention are both referring to the same thing. You enter the codes and the funds appear in the Playstation online store that you access from the system, or through computer. There is another type if card that specifically refers to playstation Plus membership. I don't know what variations there are but they could be 1 month, 3 months, or one year. But those would specifically mention that they are for the membership. They could extend your prepaid membership if you got one, but won't add cash to the account. In this case the picture shows $10 as the cash value, so that should be the same. As long as it mentions Playstation.
Why is this 26 dollars
Some people add there fees but others are just ridiculous
this gift card work on my PS4
I don't have a PS4 yet, but the credit is for the network account not an specific console so it should be perfectly usable through a PS4.
online Code?
No, you buy the card
used for ps4?
i haven't used it for ps4 but it might work
Hello, send by email?

Does this mouse work with Macintosh?
Yes and straight away without downloading any additional software. Just plug into USB and u are good to go !! You would have basic left and right clicks and scroll wheel. To click the scroll as a third button u will have to download additional software(same as for Win 7 PC). Using it myself on OSX Mountain Lion and Win 7 PC.
My palm is a little big, so is this mouse small, mid, or big size??
It's going to be small for your hand if you are a 'palmer'. If you're a 'claw' or 'finger tip' gripper it might not be much of an issue.
How many volts and Ma does it use? *Is noted on the back :)
5 v 250 mA
What kind of lame gaming mouse doesn't even feature any extra buttons?
Remember its just a entry gamers mouse not a high tech gaming mouse.
is this a quiet mouse? it's really important that is it cause i game at night mostly and i got roommates
No, the buttons make a clicking sound
Is this product a mirror version?
The mouse has a glossy finish, so is the mirror version, although is not indicated in the product name.
Does this mouse create loud clicking noise?
It maybe a bit louder than most common mouses honestly.
Is this windows 8.1 compatible?
ofcourse
Which version is this, mirror or regular?
Its the regular version.
How heavy is the Razer Abyssus?
Fairly light mate. This mouse is cheap and durable. This mouse is not heavy like other gaming mouse.
Will it work using Windows 8?
I can confirm it works with both Windows 8 and 8.1.
Does this work on a Mac?
I use it with the newest version, OS X 10.9.2, and it works great. Plug and play right out of the box.
What kind of emulators does this controller work with?
I use it with Jnes, but I think it would work with many.
Can you hook up two of the controllers for co-op games like contra?
Absolutely, I do this all the time. You just have to set up player 1 and 2 for each side...button wise. Sometimes changing the usb ports jacks up the settings but most of the time, they just work.
Does it work for all PC games or just NES Simulators?
It registers in Windows as a USB Gamepad - so it can be used for any PC game... you may just need to open the game's options and create custom mappings for the game controls to whatever gamepad input you want.
Just received it. Nestopia is recognizing it is plugged in, but there's no gaming response to any of the buttons. What am I doing wrong? Win7, hp
You have to allocate the buttons on the controller with Nestopia. This is what you do: Options --&gt; input. Select "Pad 1" and allocate the movements. Push "down" for down, "select" for select etc. Hope this works.
Is this controller compatible with Chrome OS?
Not sure about whether or not its compatible with chrome OS but I tried on mac OS X (latest version) as well as ASUS ( older windows probably 7) and couldn't get it to do anything. Also, I referred to a few sites online and obviously I was not alone with this problem, yet, I found no sure proof solution. I'm sorry this is not a definitive answer to your question but I felt you might want the warning. Note that the Q&A section for this product said it would work for these OS. Hopefully if you choose to purchase this product you will not have the same dilemmas as I.
Will this make me have to remap my emulator's input options because the controller uses joystick buttons, or does it activate keys on the keyboard?
You will have to remap the settings in the Emulator as it reads it as joystick buttons.
Good for GBA emulation?
GBA has L/R shoulder buttons. So an SNES controller would be better.
what are NES games?
NES: NINTENDO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM which was a 8 bit system, and came out in 1985 in North America. Here is a small list of games from that system: The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda II: Links Adventure, Mega Man, Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3, Blades of Steel, Dr. Mario, Tetris, Bubble Bobble, Double Dragon, Battle Toads, Duck Tales, Excitebike, Final Fantasy, Galaga, Gauntlet, Golf, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Ninja Gaiden, Little Nimo: The Dream Master, RBI Baseball and may more. These are a few that I played with my friends as a kid.
Description says that 1 is jump and 2 shoot, in reg.mario bros from wii store download 1 is shoot and 2 is jump, can you switch controls to be normal?

You just have to make sure ur wii has american system i think if it's british this would not work this is from my experience I'm not sure if it's true or not
i need a game that fits a3dsl

my friend has the regular version of RE 5, if i have this one can i still play online multiplayer with him?
You should be able too. The Gold Edition is the same game, its just has DLC content with it.
This game have the choice the language in ESPA&Ntilde;OL?
Only the subtitles. The language is only English.
Does this video game come with the manual booklet? and also is this the greatest hits version or the standard gold edition version packaging?
It depends where you buy it, and if its new/used. Though mines is a used game, it came with the manual booklet. You should be able to find out by the seller's description. I believe its the standard gold edition
Can this edition be played with the Move controllers (like RE4 for the Wii)?
Yes you can
This game have the choice the language in ESPA&Ntilde;OL?

is any of the extra content on the disc or does it need to be downloaded?
You don't need to download anything, it's all there you just have to beat the game a few times to find the stuff, and Gold has way more stuff then the first released version of the game.
I want to know whether it has a slipcover
Can you be more Pacific
Do the headphones come with every accesorry needed to plug and play? Also do the the headphones need to be connected to an outlet?
Electrical outlet, yes. This unit comes with a small amp box that requires you to plug in power. There are two additional wires, one TosLink optical cable to go to the back of the xbox360, and then the actual wire to the headphones. The headphones can be disconnected from the amp box, and adapter wire put on the end of the headphone wire, and you can plug them into your PC via the normal 1/8 inch headphone/microphone jacks. Older xbox 360's with the removable HD have the optical output on the big plug that delivers video and sound out to your tv. Newer xbox 360's have the optical out on the back of the box itself instead of on the wire adapter. On our old xbox 360's, since we are using HDMI now, we bought $7 adapters that plug into the back of the xbox and have the optical TosLink on the end of them.

hello, do you have the box and the manual with it?
You need to check with a specific seller. Some sellers mention if an item is complete with case and manual or tell you that it is "cartridge only". For the AGAIN DS game, click on the link for "41 used and new" under "More buying choices". You will see the list of all sellers and the condition of the item they are selling. You can then click through to a specific seller and use the "Contact seller" link to ask about condition of item.

If you plus it a usb 3 port which is blue it will not work . It has to be in usb 2 ports only. And try to down load the software for the controller too. Some games might not work with this controller aswell. Kinobo USB Gamepad for PCs XP/Vista/Windows 7 and be fine. I got win. 7 and 8.1 and it work with no problems at all. I use it for driving games like for all NFS games.

No
Is it compataple with mac?
It works with My Powerbook G4 but very limited software I could try it with
how can you use a xbox360 controller can you give a step by step intruction
If your controller is wireless, you will have to go through a few more steps. However, using a wired controller, you only need to plug in the USB, start your game, go to control settings, and make sure "360 controller" or simply "controller" is enabled. The following are instructions for a wireless 360 controller. 1. You need to have or purchase a wireless gaming receiver. Assuming you have windows, the software should automatically install after a few minutes. 2. Like most wireless gaming controllers, a "search" button will allow you to connect with your device. However, first you need to press the search button on the receiver. Then, press the search button on the controller. 3. If you do not connect, check your batteries and open up the "My Computer" window to make sure your receiver is connected. (Usually it will appear under devices) 4. You may need to configure some settings in-game to make sure the buttons are bound to the right control. 5. If you are still having trouble with the controls, the Xbox forums have easy-to-follow advice for most Windows versions. http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/xbox-controller-for-windows-configure#72e400f5ec8c476d9cf9c94e50918dcf
does this work with linux or ububtu
Unfortunately i have no idea if it works on those or not, I have Windows 7 on my computer. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Work in a mac???
I can't speak for Macs but this is the first and only product I have returned to Amazon because it didn't work even for a PC so I can't imagine it would work for a Mac
Problem: Am I doing something wrong?
Mine didn't even come with a cd, and my PC doesn't recognize it after downloading the driver... terrible
After you install this, Under Control Panel - Sound - Recording Does - "Stereo Mix" show as an option? Thanks
No, the sound card only shows up as a Microphone In (under recording) and as "Speakers" (under Playback). Sorry, this doesn't sound like the the sound card you're looking for it seems.
Macbook pro has only output and no input. I need device to allow me to direct mike output to laptop input via usb port. Will Amigo ii do this?
If you have a recent Mac, you will find that in System Preferences &lt; Sound, that the headphone jack (output) is interchangeable between output and input (at least it is on my 2010 13' model). So if you strictly need a mic input, your Macbook Pro can do the job. However, if you want to have audio that is not from your computer's internal speakers, you will need this sound card, or one like it.
will this work with a 32 bit os?
I use mine on a Dell Windows 32 bit machine running Windows 7
Can I connect a headset that only has one 3.5mm connection and be able to use both the headset and the mic? There is only one line from the headset.
No it wont work, you would need something like this. http://www.amazon.com/Headset-Buddy-Adapter-Smartphone-01-PH35-PC35/dp/B00332DPDG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1395030768&sr=8-3&keywords=Cellphone+Headset+To+Mic+Jack+Splitter
Boston Digital BA735 speakers with my old Gateway desktop does not work with my HP G72 laptop. Can the Turtle Beach product fix this problem?
If the speakers work with your Desktop then the sound card and the speakers on your desktop are working fine. If for some reason the speakers do not work on the HP Laptop then I would try to plug in head phones, if they do not work either then its a good possibility that your sound card is bad or misconfigured. The Turtle Beach Audio Advantage Amigo II will likely allow your speakers to work with your laptop. I did the same thing on mine and its much cheaper than sending the laptop to a shop to get the soundcard replaced. Let us know if it works for you.
Has anyone tried this for PC gaming using a Turtle Beach X 41headset?
Yes, it works fine.
Hello, a straightforward question: I have a Win 8.1 laptop with no mic-in jack. Will the Amigo II enable me to record the audio from the mic?
Yes, the usb plug provides both audio input and output functions
My headset only has one 3.5mm plug (audio and mic combo) - will this converter work for that plug?
I just tried it and could not get the mic to work using only one port. The headset will work but not the mic using only one port. You will have to buy a separate mic to use the Turtle beach USB. It has two ports one for headset and another for mic. It works great with Windows, Skype, Apple Mac, and Linux. No drivers to install. Just plug it in and it works. You will have to buy a cable adapter like this one to get it to work with your headset.. http://www.amazon.com/EZOPower-Smartphone-Headset-Adapter-Neckstrap/dp/B007JP0IVU/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1426469582&sr=8-5&keywords=3.5mm+audio+cable+adapter+for+headphone+mic+combo
does it work on ps4?
Yes it does, I use it on my PS4 and my PC
Will this work with Mac OS X? Yosemite?
Yes, it works very well with my max
Is this compatible with Android devices?
I'm not sure, but I'm doubtful of Android compatibility. While the 3GC is a good Direct Input (D Input; Logitech and most generic) gamepad, it doesn't feature Xinput (360) compatibility either.
I got one.......says to put in disc but it did not come with one.
There's a driver available on the website here: http://steelseries.com/us/support/downloads
How to make rumble feature work? Windows 8.1
idk
Has anyone tried using this on Windows 8.1
Don't waste your time buying this piece of crap. Seriously, you may as well burn the $20. That will at least warm up your hands for a few seconds. When I opened the package on mine, one of the control sticks had broken off inside of the blister pack. no big deal, super glued it back on. Tried for HOURS to get it to work. Nothing. Computer wouldn't recognize it, wouldn't even acknowledge that anything was plugged into the USB port. No drivers available. It's a worthless brick. Albeit not even a very heavy or durable brick. Just use an Xbox controller. They're plug and play. You won't have any issues with one of those. It won't break before you even take it out of the packaging, and it'll work.
Why does it cost so much? I've seen it else where for considerably cheaper, I only ask since I use Amazon alot and I see a $134.99 price tag on it when I can get it for $39.99 some where else brand new.
The game is no longer in production, thus the new and unopened versions are running more expensive...
how do you hatch and trade pokemon?
To hatch simply have an egg in your party and walk around and it will take a while and to trade go to a Pokemon center and go to the top area of the Pokemon center
Is it possible to catch the following?: Tympole,Venipede,Chimchar, Please respond and tell me if I can catch these pokemon. Thanks!
Chimchar is the only one in that game. The others will have to be traded or hatched I believe.
Can you play this with the Nintendo 3DS?
Yes
Does this come with a Nintendo DS?
No it does not
Does it come with the PokeWalker?
Yes
I want to know if this is the original ds game that came out in 2010?
Yes, it is.
Does it work with pokemon bank?
It does not work with pokemon bank but it works with poketransfer which is a partner ap. You download poketransfer for free, put any pokemon you want to transfer into box 1 of you PC, then they get transfered into the pokebank "transfer box". From here you can move them from the transfer box in pokebank to your Pokemon X, Y, Alpha Saphire, or Omega Ruby game. Once placed into the transfer box you can NOT get them back onto your Heart Gold version. It's a one way transfer. Hope this helped!
does it include the code for Nintendo Club ? so that we can register it as a game we own ? if yes, do you also sell Soul silver ?
I believe so, I bought both Pokemon Hearr Gold/Soul Silver on Amazon, both brand new, and I do believe I saw the code in it. If the game is brand new I see no reason for there not being a code. Either way owning this game is a great choice.

Yes, unless it is a xl 3DS
Will a Nintendo DS fit in here??
fits real tight. I returned it
What are the dimensions of this case?
its curved a little and I don't know the exact dimensions but I can tell you that he puts his dsi in the soft sleeve and his charger in the same side and his MP3 player. The back side holds 12 dsi games and not alot more. It is about 2 inches taller than the DSI game console. It is about 2 inches wider as well. The straps are sewn well and its easy to take with on your wrist if you need your hands for other things.

No

jewel quest downloads
I bought the game and it is installed on my computer. I didn't download it.
I downloaded Silent Hunter 5 but could not get Uplay to start up, so I could not get the game going. Any ideas?
I couldn't get it to work either. I think Amazon's version is corrupted.
Does it work 0n Vista laptop, need to know if it will work on my system.
It depends upon your specific system resources. SH5 requires a powerful CPU and GPU. The recommended system requrements are closer to what the minimum requirements really are. The community at the Subsim forums has plenty of threads addressing the nuances of SH5 as well as mods to address what Ubisoft would not let the developers finish before release.
Can I download it on a flash drive then upload it on my computer?
You would but I have Windows 7 home premium and it would not function on my system
will it run on windows 8?
Yes. It ran fine for me on my windows 8 laptop.
Will it run with Vista?
i'm running on windows 8...but it should run on vista as well...

Where Can I Buy Spare Batteries For The RAT9? Can somebody please share some info on where to buy the spare batteries?
My batteries are lasting about 2 hours a piece, so I looked into replacing the guts. (it has two tiny rectangular 3.7V Lithium packs taped together inside, the battery case is easy to open with only your fingernails) The markings on the Rat9 batteries were: "ZT-061148 1S2P 3.7V 440MAH 101120" The closest Google match for this was: http://www.d2-technology.com/product.php?m_id=6 (2) D2-LP-061148 - 3.7 Voltage(V) - 230 Typical (mAh) - 220 Nominal (mAh) - 6.0 x 11.0 x 48.0 mm - 4.0 g
MadCatz Saitek Cyborg RAT 7 Black/6400DPI? (black version) I was wondering if the product Amazon is offering is the updated version?
The Rat 9 that i bought the other day just came in, it's 5600DPI. Pretty misleading product page.
So, where is it already? I've had my order in for months, anyone have any better idea of a release date?
Good question! I've been watching since April when my 2nd G7 stopped working correctly. It's time for something new, and this looks like it, but I'm not buying without at least some other user reviews to read first.
What are the dimensions of the mouse? The listed dimensions cannot possible be right claiming that, presumably the length, is over 8 inches.
The dimensions are, and these are not exact: 4.5 inches from front to back (length), 3 inches from side to side (width), and 1.25 inches tall. The palm rest extends to make it almost 5 inches long but does not affect mouse to desk contact length.
Adjustment tool slips and does not turn the screw whenever i twist counter clockwise on the adjustable pinky rest piece. Anyone have the same problem?
The allen screw is fastened really tight and can be hard to unscrew on first adjustment. I used an allen key to remove the screw on first adjustment. If you mean that the tool slips between your fingers use an allen key the first time you remove the pinky rest, if you mean the tool slips in the screw head then you have damaged the head, try using a larger allen key or a grip paste on the screw head.
how durable is it?
Very durable.My son uses it for gaming and keeps it connected to the computer, and the rest of the family uses it as an everyday mouse.
Why is this "Item Under Review"? Quick questions: (1) Why is this item under review?
Why is this item under review
Possibly lost a part while configuring my RAT7? Well I found the spring, but was there something holding the spring and weights in besides the thumb tool and should I worry about it?
It was probably just the other black piece that holds the weights in, if the tool holds them in then I don't really see a problem.
R.A.T. 5 button question??? can i customize what each button does on the R.A.T. 5?
If it's like the RAT 7 you can
Scroll wheel properties: I would like to know if the scroll wheel on this has physical clicks as one rotates it, or is it smooth?
old post but it does have clicks between each scroll both thumb and normal scrolls do and the normal scroll middle click is a little harder then a standard mouse but i like it its not to hard to press but enough to prevent accidental hitting of the button when scrolling.

It was probably just the other black piece that holds the weights in, if the tool holds them in then I don't really see a problem.
R.A.T. 5 button question??? can i customize what each button does on the R.A.T. 5?
If it's like the RAT 7 you can
Scroll wheel properties: I would like to know if the scroll wheel on this has physical clicks as one rotates it, or is it smooth?
old post but it does have clicks between each scroll both thumb and normal scrolls do and the normal scroll middle click is a little harder then a standard mouse but i like it its not to hard to press but enough to prevent accidental hitting of the button when scrolling.
is Black cat in this game?
Black cat is not in this game from what I remember
is this a single player game or can two kids play?
This game, like most spider-man games, is a single player game. The only Spider-man game I can think of that is 2 player is called Spider-man: Friend or Foe, but that game is for younger kids than this one...hope that helps. This game by the way...is really good...my kids love it.
I'm wondering about the T rating... what about this game makes it worth a "T"- considering it for an 8 yr old
This should cover your questions: http://www.esrb.org/ratings/synopsis.jsp?Certificate=29480
Is Black cat in this game?
No she isn't. I don't think she is even mentioned.
The buttons are already "swapped", or software is required for that?
By default, the button on the left is treated as "right click" and the button on the right is treated as "left click" (so backwards from a traditional moue). With the Razer software you can set up a profile to auto load that switches this, sensetivity, macros, etc.
Hello, Anybody have the actual dimensions of the mouse itself? I have larger hands/need larger mouse. Currently, have Logitech G500. Thx!
5(L) x 2.76(W) x 1.73(H) in / 127x70x44 mm
Any advice out there? I am looking for a wireless left-handed laser mouse. I tried all the wireless ambidextrous mice.
If it is for gaming you dont want a wireless mouse, buy an original deathadder they are actually really nice.
is this mouse also good for maya 3d graphic designer ?
might a bit too heavy for graphic design. I find that playing with this kind of mouse for hours tires my hands a bit.
Does this left handed mouse click on the right side so I can rest my whole hand on the mouse and click with my index finger like righties do?
The 5 buttons on the mouse are fully customizable using the Synapse 2.0 software (which is compulsory installation to use the mouse). So you can make it a "left click" on any of the 5 buttons you want.
is it good for left handers
If you get the left-handed edition, it's great!
do the mouse wheel and logo light up?
Yes. The mouse wheel and logo do light up.
can this be used on windows 8 or 8.1?
Actually it can. It installed easily and quickly without any issues. I've played this game on my iPad and the only difference with an 8.1 touch laptop (Acer S7) was that when you "plant" a plant you have to quickly double tap it to get it to stick in place. That's not an issue if you're attentive. Other than that, good to go and IMHO better than buying a download with many of the intrusive issues that seem to go with that. Enjoy, a great game for all ages.
Does the game install completely on the hard drive or does it need the cd to be in the computer to play the game?

Does this work on Windows 7?

Does it work with PS2 Guitar Hero World Tour?
Sorry Steph I am not to sure, I am using it on the wii and on my laptop. I don't see why it shouldn't though.
Did you get Logitech or a knock off brand?

Can you use the microphone and the drums at the same time? I ask because I don't know that there are enough USB ports.
Yeah that's not a problem, or at least not for me

The one I ordered works with my Xbox 360 slim

Is getting stuck in a dark building part of the game ? because i can't get out.

Yes if u have steam u just put the serial number and u can download it from steam
Does it work on windows Xp
Well I just tried the game on an other pc windows 7 and finally it worked but am not sure about xp
Does this game have bad reviews because of physical problems, or are people just one starring this because they don't like the in game features?
I didn't care for it either. Too much verbal content, story, etc. No flowing from action to action. Just didn't float my boat. Wasn't up to other Call of Duty games.
It may be a stupid question, but if I buy the disc version does it still use Steam?
Yes. All PC version of CoD Black Ops must lunch through Steam. And to play this games the code in the disc box is necessary and sometimes the discs are unnecessary.
Does it come witha disc?
No...and the download doesn't work with W8
Does this game work on a Windows 7 laptop?
I think so when i had my windows 7 laptop the game was unplayable, but i think the problem was that my graphics wasn't good enough. It just jumped from frame to frame. Have a new computer , windows 8, and it now works flawlessly

Older Wii?There Is Wii And New WiiU.(You Can Play Your Wii Titles On The New WiiU)We Have Just The Regular Wii So Yes It Will Work For You.
When this game broke the Wii was that online only?? From what I have read on the net it only happened after going online for others.

Does this work with wii mini and can I use the classic controller pro with this game and wii mini
I do not have a wii mini --so can't address this directly. I do know that the case indicates that you can use the classic pro controller with the game. Hope this helps a little. :)

I'm sorry I don't have a Wii I have the xbox 360 and ps3 for this. My apologies. Sorry I couldn't assist you.
Does this game have robots to play with in an offline mode? I do not plan to go online with my wii.
Yes it does have a regular offline mode to enjoy,playing against automated enemies
where the instructions on how to work the controls, read lies, read green slopes etc.??
There should be a read.me file on the disc. "Also look under options. This is a very intuitive game. You have to have patience with the putting. Difficult to learn the pace of the putts.
is thi compatible to windows 7 home premium
No it is not based on my findings
game crashes when creating a player - is this problem with game or pc (or both?)
I bought this game when it first came out. I've run it with an AMD card installed and on a computer with GEForce GTX 780 Video card, Win 7 Professional, 64 bit processor, and have never had a problem with the game crashing. R
What makes these worth $90+???
Nothing, cuz it is not 90 bucks...
how many are there
four, two in black and two in blue.
WORK ON PS4?
Yes they do I bought them specifically for my ps4 controllers and they fit just right
Will it fit a Gamecube controller?
No it would not. To big.
Do these work perfectly on PS3?
yes my friend They are great and fit perfect You will definetly note the difference
can Ifit a kontrolfreek over it?
There are different kinds of KF's out. I assume no. But the caps feel awesome, and also add a little height to your sticks. I hope this helps!
Will these still fit snugly and not slip off easily if the original joystick cover has completely come off?
No. At least not for an Xbox 360 controller. If the original joystick cover has torn completely off, these fit fairly loosely and rub against the analog stick housing and make the stick harder to move.
Do these add a lot of height like Kontrolfreak FPS Freek Ultra for the PS4? I got those and now they are too high and I'm trying to avoid that.
these mainly just add comfort to your origonal thumb sticks, they do not add height
If the ps4 controller stock grips are completely torn off, will these fit snug and not slip off?
Yes they should. My Ds4's one stick is torn off and these fit well enough. Does the job. They are not full fit but doesn't matter much.
do these provide a snug fit on the xbox 360?
Sure do!

Are these genuine Razer mice? Not the fake ones going around?
The one I received was a genuine Razer mouse. Had all the paper work and everything.
does it change colors
Nope, it only comes with a blue LED.
What is the difference between the mirror and the normal abyss?
The mirror is smoother and easier to clean. The normal abyss looks and feels better, but it will absorb sweat, so after a long period of using, it's not as good as b4
will it come in the razer box? lol
Yes, it does
is this usb powered
yes
my nephew is left handed will this mouse work
yes :) that's the magic of it, Two Identical Buttons (left and right click) and the scroll wheel. perfect for switching for lefties
When you click the mouse is the sound, soft or loud? I need one that has as low noise as possible when clicking.
It makes a click but its not very loud. In fact i really didn't even notice it until i saw this question.
Do you offer international shipping? (More precisely for Macedonia)
Amazon does all my shipping, so I believe they do.
Does this have good grip when your hand sweats? Or should I go for the original Razer Abyssus?
I found this version to be exactly identicle to theoriginal abyssus except the buttons are MUCH stiffer- painfully so. But the grip is the same as far as I can tell. Personally I prefer the original
Does this mouse have hardware/software acceleration enabled? Can it be disabled?
The mouse comes with software controlled acceleration via a razer client, and a couple hardwired sensitivity settings on the base. You can disable the software accel, I dont know offhand what the default is but the client is easy to use.
Are you able to save your games?
If the game cartridges allow it, then yes.
I know there are ports for all three types of controllers. I'm curious, could I play NES games with an SNES controller?
No, but you can use the 2 controllers that come with it.
i need some type of adaptor to connect this unit to my TV, saw some on you tube but don't want to waste any more money, any solutions??????
Just get the red, white & yellow wires, unless you're trying to connect it to a digital tv, then you'd probably need the RF Adaptor
How good is the wireless connection?
Not good at all. Plus the console played less than 20% of my games.
dose game genie work with saga genesis
Yes
Can the Retron 3 play Super Famicom games?
No
Why is the grey retron 3 a bit more than the red one?
More features

does this support the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel?
I did a little research and as far as I can tell the pc version does. It also looks like you may be able to use unsupported steering wheels with some tweaking, but I haven't tried that, so I can't guarantee that it would work. Hope this helps.
does this support the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel?
im not sure if this game support any racing wheels because if not a driving simulator man, i play this game with pad controller and respond very good... greetings.
Is there a take a ride option u know to just cruise
Yup. Sure is.
Can I play off line.
Of course,,,it has a campaign and split screen so two people can race
Can I Change the language???for example spanish?
That is an excellent question Jorge! Unfortunately there is no option to alter language output in COD Ghosts (at least for the North America release). In the PS3 XMB I believe there is a language change option but it won't affect the in game/bluray disc/dvd language output. You're more than welcome to write an email to Activision suggesting that feature in COD Ghosts through a future update. But good question by the way.
will online work or do i have to buy it myself, because online is the best part of Cod games
as long as you have an internet connection, PS3 is free to go online. so yes, online works :)
Can you play multiplayer offline with another player like in COD black ops?
Yes
how many maps on multiplayer are their without dlc maps.
14 maps with out the dlc.
Is this game worth $11.90? The video looks dope and almost makes Eminem tolerable. I see good and terrible reviews. So is it worth 11.90 on PS3?
Yes
Does this game have the bonus map?
Yes, Free Fall is included
how many guns is their in mutiplayer
Although these are listed, it still depends what comes with your attachments, but I hope this helps Primary MW2 Weapons &#9726;Assault Rifles &#9726;Sub Machine Guns &#9726;Light Machine Guns &#9726;Sniper Rifles &#9726;Riot Shield Secondary MW2 Weapons &#9726;Machine Pistols &#9726;Shotguns &#9726;Handguns &#9726;Launchers

Hello, can anyone please tell me if I can play as Michael Myers in this COD? or is it only the ps4 version? Thank You!
Yes you can play as Michael Myers on the map Fog
has campaign co-op?
Certainly
Any secrets or tips on how to get the sensors to sync?
omg, i searched and searched for this. even broke the leg sensor and had to buy a new one (lol). So, after you load your profile, in the bottom right corner, click "help & settings", after click "settings", then click "rebind peripherals". after that you press and hold the button on the arm sensor till it syncs up, then do the same with the leg. also, make sure the USB dongle is plugged it. Hope this helps.
I just got mine today in the mail and the leg sensor WILL NOT SYNC AT ALL!! I used 10 different batteries, and stood there for 30 minutes pressing the
I would return. I never got mine to work.
Has anyone actually been able to create a user account on the WII? Each time I try the game informs me that the EA servers are down.
No, I haven't. I've been trying since I bought it several month's ago but it's never connected. I get same same error message.
Do the accesories that come with this game work with the first Active game?
I haven't tried it, but I doubt its backwards compatible. The resistance band is the same though.
If after trying everything and the sensors don't sync with the receiver does it mean they're defective?
Try brand new batteries in each receiver and put try to sync using the receiver in USB port 1. For some reason mine wouldn't work if I put it in the lower one. Try port 1 first then port 2 and if that doesn't work the receiver (or sensors) may be defective. If that's the case try to pick up the NFL one cheap and use the gear in there for both games. They will work with both / either game but don't move the receiver at all once it's synced.
can I add this to my current EA active 2 system so a friend can work out as well
You can yes. You need the arm band, leg band, and the 2nd USB dongle. I googled it and this is where I read it to http://www.nutwiisystem.com/two-players-and-ea-sports-active-2-exercising-with-a-friend.html. hope this helps :-)
does this include the total body tracking system?
Yes it does. Works pretty well, in my opinion. It's not perfect, but you can still do the exercise.
So does it come with everything?
Yes it comes with everything
Does that work on the wii mini ?
I wouldn't think so. Then again I'm not familiar with the Wii Mini. It has a USB thumbdrive looking thing that plugs into the back of the Wii and uses the motion sensor to read movements provided by two bands that you wear while working out. I hope my answer was helpful.
Does it require the Wii compatibility board?
No

No
Does this come with the sd card??
No it doesn't, and you can't buy just any card. You have to buy expensive cards from Sony.
Does it come with the charger? Or is it the console only?
The one I got came with a charger
Can you buy video on the psn?
You can buy any of the movies and TV shows just as you can on ps3 and ps4. You need to remain connected to Wi-Fi of course. You can also load your own vids on the memory card and watch them. I did it using avi files if I remember correctly. If you don't already know, the memory card are expensive and don't hold much data at all, I believe the largest is 64gb and cost around $100. So keep that in mind when your considering how many games, movies, music albums you are thinking of using.
If I own a PS3 is it even worth owning a Vita right now because all I see are mostly multiplats I can get on PS3.
Yes, to me it's worth it. There's a ton of games. With PS+ you can download games from PS1,PSP, VITA, etc.. If you have PS+ you get free games every month to keep if you keep your PS+ subscription current. After a few months of free games it pays for like half the cost of the VITA. Make sure you get a memory card if you will be downloading games. Or buy a bundle with a card. Some VITAs don't come with a card, like the regular Wi-Fi version. I have an 8GB card with a few games on it and there's still room left for at least a couple more. Hope this information helped!
what is the storage in this unit and the internal memory
There is no storage. You must buy a PsVita Memory card. It is a memory card specific to fit the Ps Vita only and nothing else...unfortunately. I didn't realize that til after I purchased it too but I was fine with it and still bought one. A 4GB was about $10 or so.
My PlayStation Vita- Wifi came with a quick set up guide in Spanish, not English. Does that mean the on screen instructions will be in Spanish?
Even if it is in Spanish u can always change it to English just go to settings
Can you put PS 1 Emulators on these? Like on smart phones?
The PS Vita comes built in with the ability to play PS1 games you just have to download them from the playstation store
Is this the ps vita or ps vita slim? Just making sure!:)
If we bought from thr same person I its the original vita with the mystery port
Does it play older PSP games and PlayStation exclusives?
It does, but you have to re-purchase them on the PS Store. Even if you have the original UMD, you will have to shell out whatever Sony deems the price of the title you want. Keep in mind, you will need to space to store these games.
I have some questions can you connect to ps3?| can you turn touchscreen off?
Yes you can connect a ps vita to a ps3 and no you can not turn off touchscreen
Does the multiplayer include xbox and playstation players?
no. and the PC multiplayer community is very very small. the only games i was able to get into was either team deathmatch or kill confirmed. everything else had almost no one playing and could never get into a game. if you are buying this for multiplayer...id pass.
does the disc version still use steam as a drm?
Yes. I think we need to get used to these on line platform's. I don't think they are going away any time soon. I have accounts at Steam, Origin, and U-play.
Does this game have any requirements like the downloadable version?
......a DVD drive maybe?
Will this work on windows 7??
Yes, but you have to install steam preferably
I personally loved this game on Xbone, but now I want it on PC. Is there anyone else still online? Spare the negitivity, I've already read the reviews
I just think it's awesome to play in pc! But make sure ur pc is good enough to run it!
will the game play on windows 8.1 64bit
I'm using windows 8.1 pro and the game performed very well no problems. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did!! Hope this helps.
hi, i would like to know if it comes with subtitles in Spanish, thanks for your help.
Not that I know of. English is the language of the creators, and the characters in the game. Maybe there is a version somewhere in a country whose primary language is Spanish, otherwise, you will figure it out eventually
Do you have to install steam?
Unfortunately YES.
does this include multiplayer?
yes
Is it 2 player?
Don't know. I've only played it solo.
do all xbox only come with one controller
Yes. Only one
Is it possible to watch DvD's with the Xbox 360?
Yes. As long as the previous owner doesn't have it coded.
which is the date of manufacture?
May 2012
Once I bought Xbox 4GB option, could it be somehow upgraded to 250 GB option?
Yes, you can buy an internal hard drive and install to the console, also works with some external hard drives.
can you install without sensor
Do you mean the Kinect sensor? If so, then yes. The Kinect is only required for Kinect games.
Can i do the exercise games and zumba on this or will i need to purchase extras?
if you look at the back of the individual game it shows what controllers or accessories are required/or possible for that game. ie: a game might show two wii controllers to indicate that two controllers can play at the same time.
do you ship this item in its original box?
I ordered my 9yr old son this for Christmas, and it came in the original box.
Is this the Slim version? Thanks.
No it's not if your looking for a xbox360 slim just search it up
Is this new? do it comes with all original accesories? in its original box?
No it's used, yes all the original accessories included, not in it's original box.
Is this the slim model? How do I tell if my xbox, which came in a box just like this, is slim or not? Thanks!
This is the latest model of XBOX 360, other than the XBOX ONE, The size of the unit is about the same size a a Direct TV cable box.
Does this come with the DLC?
Yes, included is a card telling you to download the Cerberus Pack for ME2 as well as the ME3 Extended Cut & Multiplayer free from the PS Store. But, there is further DLC for ME2 and ME3 that if you want, you'll need to purchase.
Is this a hard copy, or just a psn download? I'd prefer to just have it as a hard copy instead of downloading a terrabyte!!
It is a hard copy. Nothing special. Just the three disk and 2 papers, propaganda. The manuals are digital inside the disks.
Does this article come with the steelbox containing all the discs or just with the separate games with separate boxes all togheter?
Hey Emanuele The games all come together in one foldable holder, however it is not a steelbox. Hope this helps.
So it comes with all the Mass Effect Games? Right ?
Correct. And they are all incredible.
Is the online pass for Mass Effect 3 included, or do I have to pay extra, and is it worthwhile in 2014?
It is included just download the free add on and it is definitely worth it, my personal favorite trilogy in gaming history
how much space is required
5.3G minimum (for PlayStation 3)..but to be safe I would keep more than that free because it doesn't specify if that's for one game of the entire trilogy.
If I buy the Mass Effect trilogy from the Playstation Network, which DLCs would I have to buy in order to gain all of the possible trophies?
Mass Effect 1 - none, Mass effect 2- Arrival, Mass effect 3- From the ashes, Leviathan, Omega, and Citadel.
For how many players is this game?
The mass effect trilogy is mostly a single player experience although mass effect 3 does have a multiplayer survival that is up to 4 players.
Which DLC's are included in this trilogy? (I want to know if I need to buy the others or not). I would like to own all of the DLC's as well.
PlayStation 3, Bring Down the Sky will be included both on disc and on the PSN download, Mass Effect 2 will still have the same DLC on-disc that it was originally shipped with: Cerberus Network; Genesis; Kasumi; Overlord; and Lair of the Shadow Broker. Finally, Mass Effect 3 will also be exactly as it originally shipped.
Is this game like Dragon Age (RPG) but with guns instead of swords and magic?
You are going to get the same vibe with mass effect as you did dragon age story wise and rpg wise. But the combat is much better in mass effect than dragon age. Mass effect 1s combat is kinda clunky. But they improve significantly in the second and third game.
is the controller wireless?
The controller originally sold with this console was wireless, but there was no controller included with mine as I bought mine used.
is it worth it to buy the kinect? We have the xbox one and we are trying to decide whether to buy the kinect or whether to use the money to buy gam
Yes. But I never received the game that comes with the system
How many controllers come with this listing and are ALL cables included?
I believe you receive one controller and all the cables needed to play.
Does this include a "regular controller" and cables?
Mine did
what is the difference between Kinect and Kinect sensor
The Kinect sensor should come with the complete Kinect assembly. There are also Kinect rated games that utilize the sensor for game play. Hope this helps.

The av cord on all xboxs are the same however the power cords to switch from unit to unit . Xbox 360 has 2 different power sources where as the slim use only one. http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jGFTGuMCL._SX385_.jpg
is it working good?
I bought it around June. Maybe July. Can't remember the exact date. But I have yet to have a problem with it.

For the 360 you buy the Kinect device seperate.
HDD hard drive?
No hard drive
If i buy a used did it come with controller ?
No it's up to the buyer.
Can audio be output to A/V (RCA) while using HDMI (for video)?

Is it possible for this headset to work on the Xbox One ?
Yes it can work on the Xbox one, in order for it to work you have to buy the and xbox one adapter for the headset
is it work with PC ? with surround sound and evrything like PS4 or xbox 360
Mine did work with the PC with no problems.
Will these work with PS4?
They will work (I use them with my PS4). Note, however, that for in-game chat you need to order an additional cable that plugs into the PS4 controller (similar to the old xbox solution). Here is the turtle beach link, but you can find the cable cheaper elsewhere also: http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/cables-parts/ps4-chat-cable/464. Also note that although the newer turtle beach are dual band (i.e. PX51), this version is single band and can get a good amount of interference with WiFi signals. I had to use a LAN cable with my PS4 as I received too much interference when using the WiFi for the system.
We have never been able to get the microphone work for my son's ps3 - he can hear , is there something special we need to do for this to work on ps-3?
Need to turn Bluetooth off then on in pairing mode and go to audio settings to voice settings and connect there
can I connect this headset to a tv,thankyou.
Yes you can, if the tv have bluetooth, everything with bluetooth you could
So if I plug the receiver in to my PS4, and then also plug the headset in to the controller will it play in game sound, and allow chat at the same tim
Yes, the PX5 is compatible for surround-sound game audio out-of-the-box, but will require a PS4 Chat Cable or PS4 Talkback Cable for chat compatibility. Compatibility and setup information for all our products can be found here: http://www.turtlebeach.com/connect
This headset powers off every five min due to "lack of audio." Yet my Son is clearly talking. Can someone tell me what's going on &amp; how to fix them?
I haven't experienced that but like you said if there is no audio they do turn off sorry I couldn't answer your question
Will they Play 7.1 through Smart TV?
Your TV will need Dolby Digital Live output and an Optical output.
Are all accessories included? Like the wireless tower and or mix amp?
Yes, a tower/headset holder.
Will this work to listen to music and talk on an iPhone?
Yes, just pair with your iPhone by Bluetooth and you're done

Does it have split screen so that 2 people can play at the same time on same screen?
As a matter of fact, it does =)
If I have the essentials edition, will my cars and progress transfer to the full version if I buy it?
It should. Xbox games tend to be grouped by titles. I bought marvel ultimate alliance gold and it worked with my marvel ultimate alliance saves and unlocks.
Does this game have a multiplayer mode (not online) with a split screen
Yes it does.
We don't have connect but I was thinking about getting this game for my son for his birthday. Can he still play with a regular controller?
Yes
Does this game have "Open World" where I can drive without being in a race or being on a mission?
There is free drive, where you can just drive with your friends, but it's not an open world.
would this be appropriate for younger kids too? Does it use trashy animation or bikini girls in the game? I am looking for a fun family friendly game
This would be perfect for your kids. I understand your concern and can assure you, none of that material is found anywhere in this game
is it the regular or essentials edition ???
This is the regular edition
is this 2 disc version? full version?
It is the complete game with all standard cars and tracks, when I ordered I received the American Muscle DLC pack, September Penzoil DLC pack and the 2013 SRT Viper GTS-R for free. All the other DLC's you will have to pay for.
Can I use 1 Kinnect (xBox 360) on 2 players with split screen simultaneously? Thanks
Sorry I can't help you there, I dont have a Kinect. Try cheat code central, there are a ton of experienced users there.
Is this a full game?
Yes, and while some dlc codes aren't guarenteed, there's still lots of stuff for you to do. :)

Want to buy my nephew a Battlefield game and #4 seems to have to many glitches. Between #2 &amp; #3 was wondering which was the better game?
Battlefield bad company 2, was an awesome game. Enjoyed it way better than I thought. So I bought battlefield 3. That game was great and intense, I really liked that one as well. If I had to choose between the two it's a hard call. With today's gadgets for war and to match call of duty I'd go with battlefield 3. Just stay away from battlefield 4, Geez a waste of money and time.
How can I get online game code I got a used game and can't play multiplayer?
My son, to whom this game belongs, says he doesn't think you can get one on a used game. Bear in mind, though, he is 13 and may not know what he is talking about. We have a used game store in our town. If it were me, I'd call that store and see if they had any advice - do you have anything like that where you live?
Does it come with multiplayer or?
Yes. It includes a multiplayer section along with the single player campaing. See it for yourself on the follow youtube link: Battlefield 3 - Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer: http://youtu.be/FRqfFfuVuNE
What Dose Wrong Disc Region Mean??
Xbox game discs only work with Xbox consoles that are sold in the same region. For example, if you purchase an Xbox 360 console in North America, you cannot play game discs that are sold in Europe or in Asia. An Xbox 360 console that is sold in Europe can only play game discs that are sold in Europe, and an Xbox 360 console that is sold in Asia can only play game discs that are sold in Asia. It is not possible to make an Xbox 360 from one region play discs that were produced for another region. Back to the top THINGS TO TRY 1. Determine whether the game disc is from the same region as the region where you purchased the Xbox console. To verify the region, view the back of the game package. Look for a one of the following codes: * NTSC: North America and South America (United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Brazil) * NTSC-J: Asia (Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) * PAL: Europe, South Africa, India, Australia, and New Zealand 2. If this symptom occurs with only one or two discs, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for the specific game title or titles. If you find a known problem, follow the information that is discussed in the article. 3. If this behavior occurs with only one or two discs, and no known problem exists, return the disc or discs to the retail store where you made the purchase. 4. Turn off and unplug your console, remove the Hard Disk Drive unit and any attached Memory Units, and then reconnect your console. Try the disc again. If this appears to resolve the issue, turn off and disconnect your console, re-attach the HDD and MU, and then delete any saved games for the game title in question.
Is it a good idea to install both disc 1 and 2 to the system hard drive?
It depends on how much space you have on your console. If you Don't have a lot of space on your console then don't do it. If your console has a lot of space then maybe. Don't just fill your hard drive completely or it would cause some lag. If you found this helpful then great. If not I am sorry for wasting your time.
what disc region is this game?
The disc is locked for USA used only.
What multiplayer maps does the standard edition come with?(Not including dlc)
I don't know. I don't play the multiplayer part of the game.
Is everything here to start playing (other than a game)? Would I have to purchase anything else?
There is only one controller if you need the second one you need to buy it. Also some games use kinect you need to have that also I was told if you want to make this x box to hold more info you need to get a flash drive. Before I bought it on line I asked a lot of questions who had one and also people at stores who are in that department. I hope I helped you
Comes with cables?
Yes. When bought in store they normally come with the game console, cords, and 1 controller.
is this the old version,or the slim new one? cause the picture on the box show the new one but the description on top says that it is the old version
Idk why it says old version thats what I was expecting but its the new slim version.
Can I use the hard drive from my older X box 360 in this model?
Yes you can
Can anyone help me identifying which is the internal Hard Drive that could match this Console? THANKS
Wal-Mart sells an external 500MB drive just for Xbox.
this xbox 360 works 100 works or not. read discs movies and memories good and how soon hand it over
It works 100 % as expected, but when i purchased this "slim" i got the newer 360e, i wanted the slim cause it has more usb and is a bit quiter than the "e," but other than the false advertising which amazon was pretty unwilling to fix, this xbox works with no problem.
Is everything here that i need to start playing? (Besides the games)
Yes
does it come with games
No
Dear Sr. I need to know the manufacture day. Please wait for your answer.
The manufacture date is october 25, 2011 (corona)
I ordered this today and i am confused. Is this the "E" model or the "slim" model?
I honestly do not know. Its a regular Xbox. Not slimmer than my other one. I'm sorry. I bought it for my 10 yr old. I'm not to game console savvy.
will it play on windows 7/64 ?
yes.
Serial key not working ,
Can't help. the label that has the key is so faint it is blank. The whole thing is useless!!
Will Rome Gold Edition work with Windows 8 ?
I have planned the game on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 and the game works fine on both.
were can I find the strategy book for Grand Ages: Rome?
I don't know. I bought this game for my son and he couldn't play it because it is not compatible with our new computer, it's an older game. Please make sure your computer program is compatible before you buy the game.
can you play this game solo?
The game is really set up to be played solo so absolutely. It's a great game and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
do i need the original total rome before i buy the gold edition?
My son only has the Gold Edition and plays it just fine.
Is there another game out like Home Front ?
Our apologies, but due to our large volume of emails, we do not currently have the resources to answer individual questions about our inventory. Here is some info that may be helpful: EDITION: We sort our books by the ISBN (10-digit unique number) of each book. So when you see our listing, the edition will match the information posted. Sometimes a vendor will sell a previous edition under the most recent listing; that is why you will see other vendors specifying an edition number to clarify that they are selling a different edition than the one listed. If you search for your book by its ISBN and find our listing, it should be the correct edition you are looking for. CDs AND DVDs: We try to make sure to list in the comments section if a disc is included with the book or not. If the comments do not specify, the book does *not* usually include a CD. STUDY GUIDES: Unless specifically noted otherwise in the comments, we sell study guides and textbooks separately. A textbook from us will *not* include the study guide. CONDITION: We sort our inventory by condition according to the following guidelines: Like New - Undamaged cover, no missing pages, all pages undamaged (no creases or tears), no underlining/highlighting of text, no damage to binding, no writing in margins. (Could easily be mistaken for brand new.) Good - Very minimal damage to the cover (no holes or tears, only minimal scuff marks), dust jacket not necessarily included, minimal wear to binding, majority of pages undamaged (minimal creases or tears), highlighting/underling acceptable on textbooks as long as text readable and it is not an excessive amount, no missing pages. Acceptable - Some damage to the cover but integrity still intact, binding slightly damaged but integrity still intact, possible writing in margins, possible underlining and highlighting of text, no missing pages. (Item beaten up a bit but it works.) If an item has some unusual type of damage, such as water damage or a binding so badly damaged that it is falling apart, it should be noted in the comments. Thank you for your business, E-Commerce Customer Service Team
Is Multiplayer still online ?
idon,t know hven,t played that game in a while.on line is fun thogh.it should be still alive
Will this run on Windows XP SP3?
not very well, it will run, but expect tons of errors and graphical glitching... it will also depend on your hardware, but the worst graphical glitch you will encounter will be the crash scene. advice: pass this game by, its not worth the frustration/being so linear/and all the issues and inconsistencies just aren't worth it in my opinion. complaint: by far the worst game released in the last 15 years, hands down. story line is almost nonexistent. gameplay mechanics are terrible.
what are system req, ments for this game. will my hd 7870ghz do it justise? and is the gameplay good?
Not sure what your processor or memory capability is but I used an 8800GT video board and the game worked fine. Game play is above average to good.
Will the game support a Logitech F310 gamepad, combined with a 2Ghz/Win7/D-Core/4Gb ram/Directx-11 environment? 2nd: Plz confirm NO "Steam".
1. That gamepad will support Homefront. 2. We need more information about the system specs, since there's a huge difference between a 2 Ghz Intel Celeron and a 2 Ghz Intel i3/i5 multi-core processor. Would also need to know what kind of graphics card you have. Looking at the minimum system requirements, though, you need at least an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon X2 2.8 GHz to run this, so I don't think you'd be able to do much with the game. 3. The game does require Steam. 4. I'm an avid PC gamer and have had a Steam account since a few months after it was launched. While I have had a few issues (I can count maybe 4 out of the 600+ games in my library), the issues have never been inherently related to Steam. Homefront ran just fine for me.
Does the online still work in 2014?
In short - no. There are still a few private servers scattered about here and there but it's officially dead in the water.
does it come with a steam key?
The version I purchased, did not. You can purchase it through steam, however I liked having the discs and if memory serves, it was less expensive from Amazon. I do have it listed in my steam library and can boot from steam that way.
I own Rof Iron Cross edition. Which flight joysticks are supported or recommended as my Logitech Freedom 2.4 is fried and I need to replace. thanks
I use Logitch Extreme 3D Pro and it works for me. Can't get the throttle to work on the joystick, but the key board works for that. Hope that helps.
Do you need the original Rise of Flight to play this Iron Cross edition, please?
No, Iron Cross Edition is an original Rise of Flight copy, not an expansion.
On what programs (Vista, 7, XP) does it work on?
Both
Do you need to buy planes? If so, how much do they cost? Thanks!
Yes you do. See Rise Of Flight .com, look under the store tab for pricing.
Does it come with the headset
No, it was just the chatpad.
can you plug in both at the same time
Yes you sure can.
Does this come in the original box as shown in the picture??
Yes, where the chatpad and headset are is see-through plastic and the rest of it is the original box.
Can you plug the headset directly into the controller without the chatpad?
Yes at the bottom of the controller
does this work with the PC?
I honestly don't know. But this one didn't even work on my box
do i have to use the headphones that come with it, or can I still use my blue tooth head set?
You should still be able to use any headset with it, it's essentially an extended microphone jack. I'd still research outside of amazon to be sure.
Is the end of the head set only for xbox or could you use it for a computer too?? Thanks for your answers!!!!!
The manual says it's only for the xbox 360.
xbox one controller compatible?
I doubt it. I think the controllers are different.
can I use the pad with Netflix or Pandora or internet explorer? as if it was a pc keyboard?
Yes, I use it on netflix all the time. It works well. The mic broke like 3weeks or so. Didn't last long, but I mainly bought it for the pad.
does it come with the headset
I would say no this is listed as only chat pad, but read the seller description if it doesn't say anything about the headset assume it isn't included.
is it two player
No.
Do you need xbox live to save?
No. You just need Xbox Live to play against other racers and post your special achievements.
Do you need a separate wireless steering wheel?
I play with the regular xbox controller and I love it. Why would you need a steering wheel? Just use your normal controller...
is it two player
No.

Does this guitar work with Rock Band 2 for PS3?
No, just for Rock band 3
is it compatible with rocksmith guitar game for PS3 ?
Hi! No, because Rocksmith converts the analog signals from an electric guitar with its special cable, and this guitar is basically sending a MIDI (digital) signal. I hope that helps... I know I wanted to do the same, but ended up buying a nice Acoustic/Electric (Ovation) for Rocksmith.
does this include the dongle
Yes.
Does this work with Lego Rock Band for PS3?
No. It only works with Rock Band 3.
Is this guitar compatible with Band Hero featuring Taylor Swift?
Highly unlikely. As far as I know, the Mustang PRO guitar is only compatible with Rock Band 3. It isn't even compatible with earlier versions of Rock Band, let alone games from a different series.
any way to plug it into an amp?
no
What other midi devices does this work with? Can I use on my computer?
Yes but you will need an adapter for it
Is it compatible with PAL system?
As far as I know, it's only dependant on system (Xbox/PS) and should work in any region. That being said, I only tested the regional functionality on keyboards (wich work well US-&gt;EU). Cheers!
Is it compatible with Guitar Hero: Metallica and GH 5?
have not use it with these but that being said I use it as midi connection the dongle has not been a factor. it will work with native instruments like contact, core player etc. the only thing about the guitar is it has a sustain about it, when you make a chord you can`t mute it with your hand by touching the strings like a real guitar. I have seen a few videos on youtube abut the guitar use check them out. it`s fun to play with. hope this was helpful,have fun jerry
Is this the official cable pictured or another copy from Asia?
The last time I checked, when I clicked the link to go to the product page, one of the pictures IS the official cable because of the embossed Microsoft logo, however, when I ordered one, I got a knock-off. I just recently found a first-party cable at Wal-Mart for twice as much, but at least I now have one that I know for a fact as first-party. As I said in my review, just to stay safe, your better off looking elsewhere because you don't have that guarantee here. I hope this helps.
Would it work if I have a 320gb hdd first generation of Xbox's for I want to transfer my data from my 60gb to the 320gb?
Yes, you can transfer any memory to all 360's. (Arcade/Pro/Elite etc.) It is possible to transfer data to slim from any old 360 as well too. The only problem is slim to slim HDD, and that's because the casing is built different. This old transfer cable will plug into a slim 360's USB port, but the other end will not fit into the hard drive. There is slim adapter for the fit of the the newly built casing, but money and time can be saved when you take apart the old 360/slim HDD's. Then you can place the old hard drive into the slim casing and screw it back together. That's just a shortcut I would take if I don't need any further memory yet.
Can you play games directly from the external hard drive with this cord?
As far as I understand it, the hard drive, once formatted with the third party cable, ONLY works if the cable is plugged into the system and the hard drive (which should now be 32 GB) is linked with the cable and NOT where the hard drive originally should be. This is due to the hard drive now being read as an external storage device. If you have a first party cable, then once you have moved your data, the cable has done its job and is no longer necessary. It all comes down to if you have a cable straight from Microsoft or one from another company. I hope this helps. =-)
does this cable hook up to the xbox and transfers from the xbox 360 to the new hard drive or does it hook up directly to the old hard drive??
How most cables should be set up for the original 360s are where you place whatever hard drive you WANT to transfer content TO needs to be connected to your system, and your existing hard drive needs to be connected with the box end of the cable. The USB end connects to the back of the system where you would plug a wireless adapter or some other accessory. Be warned about my review however; if its third party, you could wipe your new hard drive. I do NOT know about the slim or X1 looking models. I hope this helps answer your question. :-)
Can this cable transfer xbox 360 slim hard drives to xbox 360?
Yes it can.
Do you need 2 xbox's to transfer? I want to move my games from my 120G HD to a new 320G
No. The transfer cable powers the new hard drive while transferring.
Can you use it to permanently connect an old 360 hdd for saving games and such?
In the directions it explicitly says 'not intended for long term use'. So I would say no, but I haven't tried.
I was told that you need a utility disk to make the transfer happen. Does the cable come with the utility disk?
Bought mine 5 months ago and it came with one.
Does this remove HDCP? I'm trying to record gamplay footage with the elgato but HDCP is preventing that.
Yes it DOES!!!
hdcp
It actually does strip the HDCP content, I record HDMI with HDCP and without the splitter I cannot record, with the splitter I can!
Will this play bitstream out? I seem to be having issues with it.
I'm not sure you can, this seems to be the revised version. To my knowledge Amazon was threatened w/ a lawsuit from I'm not sure who but according to the reps at Elgato capture selling HDMI strippers as the action itself was illegal. I'm not sure if that somehow affects your situation but the ones I purchased also didn't work but for a few hrs.
Has anyone used this slitter with a Tivo? I'm concerned with HDCP and Tivo, since id did not work with a matrix switcher I have.
Mine did not work for anything,wasted money.
Can I set it up with a laptop to two TVs, and have the TVs act as extensions to the desktop and not just copied?
Not unless your computer has the option to extend its display. Even so the two tv's would show the same image as this is a splitter...
Frame Rate Issues? Anyone? When using this, it does remove HDCP, but I have frame rate issues when going from my phone (Galaxy S4) to my Colossus.
no idea
Power adapter support 220v? Or 110v only? Thanks!
Only 110-120v.
Does this work with chromecast? Does it have auto switch?
I am not sure how you intend to use it with Chromecast. Are you intending to split the signal received by the Chromecast dongle? I would assume that it would work fine but I could be wrong. The Sanoxy unit worked well the HDMI output of my receiver to take it to two TV's.
Will this product work with a Motorola DCX3200-M HD cable box provided by Charter?
I don't know. I'm using HDMI male to male from computer to two HD TVs. Sorry.
I want to split a Directv signal, one to a Yamaha AVR which supports 3D, and another to a Logitech Revue GoogleTV which does not. Will this work?
Yes, both will receive the signal being sent out by the Directv box. I currently have it setup with a 3d projector and a standard hd tv. I am running standard hd to both. I have not tried turning on the 3d since I never watch anything in 3d.
will controller work with windows?
Yes it will. But at this point i've only tried it on my PC with windows XP and using a Super Nintendo emulator. I haven't much tried it past that, but I think it should work on almost anything. It's plug and play
are the triggers switched on this controller like how the 360 cont is, that is the only reason I'm looking to get one?
Yes they are but if u are playing fps games I don't suggest this controller the gun shoots way after u let go of the trigger just a heads up
Is there anything we can do if a brand-new controller won't charge (i.e. if the controller can't operate unless it's plugged in)
What I do is plug it in to a usb plug next me but then that idk
Where can I buy a replacement usb receiver for the power A pro elite controller?
GameStop or a game store
Would I be able to use it on my mac?
It will work on any computer
Is there a "dead zone" and how sensitive are the analog sticks? I keep seeing different takes on the matter
Don't even bother buying this controller I bought it and when I received it, if never turned on or even worked at all its a waste of money
can you put kontrol freeks on this controller?
I'm not sure. But the analog is similar to the Xbox's
I just bought this but it wont cut on does this need batteries?
No its wireless make sure the sensor is properly plugged in to the usb port, it may also just need to be charged
Does it work on ps4?
No. As a owner if this not so great product. It doesn't charge fully and you can't disconnect it. The arrow buttons are disfunctioal. Sorry if I don't help by telling you this.
Can you plug in your headset to it?
nope.
Anyone know if this is Linux Compatible? Is this controller Linux Compatible?
Should be a switch on the back for Xinput and DirectX input. Make sure it's on Xinput and it should work. "jstest-gtk" (sudo apt-get install jstest-gtk) is a program that will allow you to calibrate a Game pad, it's pretty much a must have for all Game pads and can be acquired from the Ubuntu software center also, if you use that OS.
How long is the length of the cable?
According to Logitech it is 1.8 meters which is 5' 10"
using controller with steam games?
I bought 3 of these because I bought 3 copies of Flight Simulator X for Steam (one for me, one for my wife, and one for my son). I thought I would have to reprogram the buttons but it worked great out of the box. It's the exact same style controller as our Xbox 360 controllers. In fact I think these are a more comfortable fit. It worked a little funky at first but I realized that was my fault. I had to flip the switch on the back of the controller from X to D. I think that's from Xbox mode to Direct mode. After that it worked great and I was able play on Steam.
Is it compatible with windows 8?
Yes. Go to http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/gamepad-f310?crid=411&osid=14&bit=64 for the controller, click downloads in blue, and underneath the controller image you will be able to choose windows 8 (32 or 64 bit) for the drivers. I'm sure they are on the cd provided too. If not, you can just get them off the site.
DOES IT WORKS WITH A MAC???
It works, but you have to flip the switch on the bottom to "D". Some games may need Gamepad Companion, which will recognize the controller when it is switched to "D" and then let you map the buttons and joysticks to keyboard key presses and mouse movement. I just tried it with Solar 2, and the game detected it (in "D" mode) but all the buttons were mixed up and so it was nearly impossible to play. So you might have to use Gamepad Companion to map the buttons to keys to get around that for some games.
rumble
nope
I need some help, would this controller be better for racing games like NFS over the arrow keys on a keyboard?
I would say yes, the analog sticks give you more precise movements because they are analog not just a digital on/off signal such as arrow keys, but does take some getting use to, so at first you will be worse. in my opinion, however, if you want this for racing games, I highly recommend buying a cheaper racing wheel over a gamepad, provided you can spend a little extra $$$ and space isn't a huge issue. even a cheap $50 racing wheel will be 1000 times more realistic and precise feeling than a gamepad. If you dont have much cash, maybe a cheap thrustmaster steering wheel would fit well? If you have plenty of money to blow and you are really into racing games, nothing beats a logitech G27. period. (I am currently using a microsoft sidewinder steering wheel from the early 2000's and I LOVE it, im very into racing games and wish I had money for the G27...
what is the (deadzones) means ?
A deadzone means that you move the control stick and nothing happens. Please see the following response found on Yahoo answers: "The deadzone is the region of movement which is not recognised by the device. Generally this is in the region around the center position. Leave your joystick centered. Now using a very light touch, slowly move it in any directon until on the screen the cursor or pointer moves. (repeat in other directions also) The region (or amount of movement) that the joystick can physically move without registering any change is the deadzone for the stick. Varies from model to model, in some you can even adjust manually or by software the amount of deadzone in both the X and Y axis." This answer was found on: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=1006031104229
Will it work with Windows 8.1
There's no reason it shouldn't if installed properly, always get drivers from Logitechs site, an remember to flip the switch in back of the controller.
Does this controller have X-input capability?
It Does
How long is the USB cord?
6 feet long
will this work for my xbox 360.
if you switch it to Xinput it works just like a 360 controller. If you use Direct-input, it Works on a PS3, but i'm not sure about PS4.
Is this thinner than the F710? I like the F710 but it feels a little too bulky for my comfort due to the battery pack. Thanks in advance!
I myself do not own an F710 but I've seen it and held it in my hands. The answer to your question is yes its a bit thinner and lighter than the F710. What I like about these devices, they have a switch on the underside to switch from Dinput to Xinput. What that means is your device can be seen by very old games which support Dinput (old controllers style) and it can be set to play new games which support the Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers when switched to Xinput. Once set to Xinput any new games which support the Microsoft Xbox 360 controllers can be played by this device.
can it play retro games from Sega Genesis era? any fighting games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter 2.
I'm not sure about the sega games but it has x input and direct input,which means the older games you can map the buttons to play them .The button mapper in on the cd that you get with the controller,hope that helps.
Will this work on a PS3 and Mac version 10.8.5?
I don't have a PS3 but as far as I can tell it does not work on the PS3 console. Yes it does work on the Mac system, just plug it in and it should see your device and install the necessary drivers.
does it work on steam? and is there the deadzone problem?
Yes it will work on Steam providing that the game have support for controllers. For games that is on Steam which do not have controller support you can use an emulator like Pinnacle Game Profiler. You can go there website at "pinnaclegameprofiler.com" and download a thirty days full trial of the software to emulate games on Steam which do not have controller support. As to your second question...There is no dead-zone problem with this particular gaming device unless you bought it faulty or if it has taken a bad fall from you or someone else. One thing though as any other product, overtime as you put pressure on the analog sticks they will start to come of the dead-zone but that my be years from now or months from now depending on how often you use it for gaming. Sometimes lets say for e.g. a first person shooter game if you need to do some quick running or looking around and the tension in the game will have you putting pressure on the analog sticks, so that in itself will, after time throw off the dead-zone.
can i use it for my iMac
Well i don't have a Mac but i searched around and that it works on some games and kinda gives trouble on others ,it is the drivers logitech doesn't seem to have drivers for Mac probably you can check out the xbox controller.
Can this headset be used while charging?
Yes
Windows 8: Does anyone know if this headset works under Windows 8?
I have tried it on two different Windows 8 machines and it works just fine.
does it work with mac?
The headset will work on Mac. However, you can't have the 7.1 software on your Mac, and therefore, you can't have 7.1 in your headset. Stereo and mic will work just fine, though.
Some headset will press my ears against the glasses, this makes my ears hurt after wearing for awhile. Is it comfortable to wear it with glasses?
Very Recommended.
Is the wireless quality really "Gaming grade"? Can anyone compare to the wired version of the product? I have that one now.
As a game developer, I use these headsets religiously. They are not the best quality, but compared to 90% of wired headsets near the same price range they are just as good. Only problems I have with the headset is the boom for the microphone. The elbow that attaches boom to the left headphone is made out of plastic and if dropped on that elbow it will break with ease. (I strength my headsets by attaching 38 gauge aluminum with some liquid steel adhesive, to the elbow join) I have used a number of these headsets and currently own three. Two for work and one for home. Being able to get up and get a drink or rush to a project meeting, without stressing about tripping over a cord or ripping the USB out is hard to beat. Hope this review helps, if you have any questions about the headset let me know and I'd be happy to answer them for you.
Anyone use these with Google talk? If so, how's the microphone quality? I get tired of people saying what? can't hear you. Noisy/scratchy background, etc. I would like to make works call on them.
Sound quality is quiet good, especially for a headset. You can get stand alone microphones with better quality but for a headset the microphone is quiet good. I don't get any background noise, NO scratching or hum. I use it quiet often for gaming and Skype calls, works perfectly. The "G-Keys" allow you to assign a push to talk or any sort of macro keys. Let me know if you have any other questions. Please give me feedback, thanks!
Has anyone found a good hardcase for these headphones? I have been looking at various ones, but I haven't pulled the trigger yet...
the size is almost as big sennheisser hd 650, maybe you can use that headphone case
Xbox one compatibility?
No
I've seen a lot of connectivity issues with this headset. Does it have the ability to function plugged in as if it is not wireless?
The cable that plug into the headset serves only as a charging cable. The end of the cable is also marked with a battery icon. Removing the USB wireless receiver from the dock also disconnects the headset even when the headset is plugged in via the cable. This headset sends and receives audio over a wireless connection, so NO IT DOES NOT. The other answers are talking about the charging cable. I've been using my G930's for just under six months and haven't experienced connectivity issues not caused by myself. I've knocked the dock off my desk and it disconnected momentarily though immediately reconnected. disconnecting and reconnecting the USB receiver reconnects just a quickly (unless the driver crashes. You can manage to restart the G930 software and it will fix the issue though it isn't always your friend.). Issues might occur if one plugs the receiver into the back of their computer. I have my receiver in the dock on top of my desk. I greatly recommend this headset.
Do these take advantage of a soundcard? If these are plugged into a USB port for the wireless... is there a point in spending $60 on a 7.1 Soundblaster?
Nope there's no point in paying 60 bucks on a 7.1 soundcard in tandem, unless you also want to have a surround speaker setup. You are correct John, all audio is processed by the G930's soundcard including the simulated 7.1. While using the headset all other audio hardware in your system will be ignored.
I have a 21 inch all in one. Can I hook it up to it?
Yes. I purchased this product though and it did not work, it would hook up to the TV and turn on but it would not read any games I put in it. I tried multiple games none would work.
Can you use original NES controllers?
Yes you can . You can buy the reproductions here on Amazon or if you have the original controllers they are the same design. They will fit this system I have one . I also have another retro bit that looks like the super NES system you can use the original SNES or the NES controllers on that , and the games from both systems . They work very well play them all the time .
Does this work with Famicom (Japanese) carts?
No, you will need a converter
does it work with a flat screen
As long as you have the rca or composite connections, yes
is it the red white yellow cords?
Yes.
I didnt realize my TV didnt have a Yellow in for video. Is there anythying I can buy that will convert the yellow and white plugs to HDMI?
Check with best buy they have connectors for that
is it hard to hook up
POWER BUTTON BROKE AND WONT WORK
Why are there four buttons on the controllers? Nintendo only had two buttons on their original controller
There is still the "A" and "B" button but, there is also "AA" and "BB" ; holding the "AA" is the same as constantly tapping the "A" and the same goes for "BB" and "B".
Why doesn't Faxanadu work?
Some of my games work and some don't. I think you should try to clean the cartridge. If it still doesn't work, i don't know.
easier to hook up?
Yes
Is it possible (w/o getting any special software) to use an Xbox 360 controller for the PS3? If so how?
go to your local Walmart or Target. They might have a 360 style controller for the ps3 might cost you a bit though. maybe 30 or 40 bucks.
does this load DVD/BD disks from the front (like the original PS3) or from the top? My components are in a stack and I need front load .
If you have what is pictured then it loads straight in the front right on top of the on/off buttons you can see in pic.
which version of software or Firmware has? 3.55? native software?
3.55 was a long time ago, I believe it was the first major geohot exploitable firmware but to get one of those you'd have to buy one that specifically has one. You can downgrade to 3.55 on certain firmwares but not the current one
Why is this console still being sold for this high of a price when you can get a PS4 for cheaper?
Because the demand still high.
Can this play ps2 games?
No none of the playstation 3's in production are able to play ps2 games
does it accept 220V?
125v is it's limit. 220 would just burn it out, and we don't want that.
good by chance brings the ps3 and if it works in good condition?
I'm not sure what you are asking, but our family really likes this particular PS3. Works great and was in excellent condition.
which version of firware has
Firware?
I wana play ps1 and 2 games can i
If you download them from the playstation store, then yes, i believe so. The store may not carry the games you want, however. Otherwise, i do not believe the system is backwards compatible. Therefore it cant play the disks.
What CECH is the console and what year it is?
It's a 2009 model and Idk about the other part.
it wont download on my windows 7
You will have to check if the software is compatible with windows 7. I had use the software on an older version of MS Windows XP or 98.
Loads great, but will not play. What do i need to do to correct?
You are not missing much as the game is a let down being from Hoyle
Will it actually work with Windows 7 now?
i can not say for sure.
Bought Hoyle Mah Jongg and installed it, but clicking on tiles doesn't cause any thing to happen. Why doesn't it work?
not sure why by I know that I wasn't happy with the game and thought that it would have been a lot better coming from Hallmark. Very disappointed in it
Is there a warranty
Well if I'm not mistaken,I think there's a warranty you can get from the store but I believe that is only available if you purchase a brand new ps3 & it has to be within a year too. Ima check to make sure though
Dumb question but is there away to use a USB flash drive to copy to "save" games also i hear that some of the PS3 consoles are loud even NEW
Yes you can. Just plug in a USB drive and copy your game saves onto your USB; that's what I've done for my Fallout 3 saves.
what is the model # of the ps3
The model number is CECH-3001A depending upon which release of the console the model number will vary.
Does this one include a control?
ps3 controller YES, ps3 remote like tv remotes NO, hdmi control NO after firmware update 4.11
Is this work in Power 220V ???
yes
what is the model No. of the system? Is it CECH-2501A (as shown in the pic)?
Yes it is but I recommend the ps3 slim 120gb models.
Is this work in Power 110V ???
yes
how many controllers can it handle?
Goes up to 7 players
good night , specifically that comes with console , controller ? cable av cable hdmi ?, ? cable ac ? comes in original box? some details stripes or yo
The one I received did not come with a controller. I had controllers left over from my old system. It did come with the box but did not have the Styrofoam inserts. I don't remember getting an HDMI cable. It did come with the ac adaptor. I think your mileage will varry. You may get something that will look like it was pulled off a store shelf or you may get something that needs some additional things to be purchased. You may want to contact the seller directly if your looking for a complete system with all Accessories.
Is this a ps3 fat or a slim
Es lo que dice en la caja
Is there zombies on Ds
Yes, but it a lot harder than the normal zombies. You get hit once and your dead. There are different maps, no perks, no pack a punch, no revives, and the prices for things are jacked up high. But it's pretty fun but not worth $20. Try to find it cheaper.
My step son just has a regular ds...i see something about wifi on this game, do you have to have a ds that connects to wifi??
All ds, and 3ds systems connect to wifi but Nintendo shut down the wifi access for their old ds games
Does this work with circle pad pro? Do any DS games?
Sorry I don't no but it works on his Ds
do both players on a local game need the game?
thank you for the good A+A+
Does this have bots on it?
Its a campaign, and then there's a killhouse. Yes with bots.
does the ds version have campaign?
Yes
My step son just has a regular ds...i see something about wifi on this game, do you have to have a ds that connects to wifi??
You do not need wifi to play Black Ops for the DS. Any DS can play this game. The Wifi connection is only used to play against other players around the globe. Without the wifi, you can still play with a friend nearby (your friend must also have the game to do this) or by yourself against the computer players. I have not played Black Ops DS with Wifi or a friend and still had a blast (on the regular DS).
Is there a way to save your progress when you get to different worlds?
Try this out. When you want to quit playing, choose to go to the home menu and you'll be asked if you want to save. Choose save and when you want to play again, you'll start off where you left off. That simple.
Do these codes actually work?
Yes! I puchased my code about a year ago and altjough I found it difficult at first to install, (read the reviews, my instructions on how-to are there if you need help) it has worked perfectly. The game is still on my Wii, has never ever crashed and I still happily play occassionally.
Is this the same game as the original, or is it a remake?
Original
do you have to have that controller or can you use the one that comes with the system
You have to use the classic controller. It's a few bucks
Once you download it do you have to have Internet to play it?
No you don't
How do you play the two player mode? Do I have to get two of the classic controllers?
I would guess yes. I've never done it but this game absolutely will not work without the classic controller
Can you still redeem on the Wii since they shut down some internet things? And if so is there any where to get the first Super Mario Bros.?
Wii shopping channel has not been taken down yet so you can still redeem the code from the Wii shopping channel at this point. And you can get the first one from the Nintendo eshop if you would like.
Does this game work on Wii U?

Do I need to buy any additional controllers to play any particular gaming system of the three
You don't have to, but you can hook up 2 each of the original controllers of all three systems. I recommend doing that if you can afford to buy them separately. I myself bought one of each. Be careful though, cause some of the after markets aren't the best. It's better to buy the originals but pricier...The wireless controllers that come with the system aren't bad, but the control configuration is weird. On some systems a is b and b is a. It will throw you off till you get used to it. Also you have to be directly in front of the system for them to work and pick up the sensor. Hope that helps Katie.
Will this model play Castevania 3?
It will play any true NES, SNES or Genesis title, Castlevania included.
how can I claim Warranty? is not working anymore and I bought it 3 months ago.
If the warranty is from the seller of course contact them first. If it is from the manufacturer you can contact them at (626) 571-5100 to see how to proceed.
Are you able to capture footage from the Retron 3 with an El Gato HD capture card?
Yes you can, works great!
Do you have to buy the controllers for all 3 platforms or will the SNES old controllers work for all three platforms (nes/snes/genesis)?
You have to buy controllers for all 3 systems. The wireless controllers it comes with do not work
Where are the L &amp; R buttons on the controller?
I used an snes controller so I don't know where they are on the ones provided are
Which is better, this or the Retro Bit Super RetroTRIO 3 in 1?
My daughter loves this one. I have the knowledge of the other one.
is this system compatible with a newer flat screen tv? or will i need an special hookup
Long as your flat screen TV has RCA inputs it will hook up. I have a Samsung but it is about 7 years old. No issues using RCA inputs. Wireless remotes are the big issue. Stock up on remotes. Each systems games need to use that systems remotes unfortunately.
can it play "nintendo world championships repo cart"?
Yes
Does anyone have a problem when they try to load a Genesis game and it says an error message like "this game will only play on NTSC Sega consoles"
There are Indeed a few sega games that do not work with this console. If you search the internet there have been many attempts at compiling lists of Incompatible games. I believe it is something to do with a chip (fx?) used in some game cartridges at the time.

Long as your flat screen TV has RCA inputs it will hook up. I have a Samsung but it is about 7 years old. No issues using RCA inputs. Wireless remotes are the big issue. Stock up on remotes. Each systems games need to use that systems remotes unfortunately.
can it play "nintendo world championships repo cart"?
Yes
Does anyone have a problem when they try to load a Genesis game and it says an error message like "this game will only play on NTSC Sega consoles"
There are Indeed a few sega games that do not work with this console. If you search the internet there have been many attempts at compiling lists of Incompatible games. I believe it is something to do with a chip (fx?) used in some game cartridges at the time.
I just got mine in the mail and I'm wondering how do I connect it to the Wii U?
plug it in your wii remote.. like u would the num chuck
Can i play wii u games(mario kart, smash bross) with this controller?
Yes
does it have a usb
No. It plugs directly into the Wii remote
We have a Wii system and got a Zelda game via the wii shop, will this remote work with this Nintendo64 game? Our currentWii remotes aren't compatible.
Yes, it will work. The buttons are not in the same position as original N64 controller so takes some getting used to. I am not sure if this is because it is a generic controller or not. Possible non issue if go with brand name controller.
This is original nitendo?
No
Will this work for the game "Call of Duty"?
No
does this work with call of duty mw3/ black ops
I don't know if that game supports the classic controller, but I CAN say that this particular knock off won't work at all. DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP KNOCK OFF. PAY MORE FOR AN OFFICIAL CONTROLLER.
is it wireless
it plugs into the normal wii remote, so its wired to that but not to the console
Can I use this to play Zelda Hyrule Warriors?
Honestly dont buy this third party controller, my wiiU doesn't recognize it at all
How long is the cord for classic pro controller
3 feet. But it plugs in to your wii remote.
is Black cat in this game?
Black cat is not in this game from what I remember
is this a single player game or can two kids play?
This game, like most spider-man games, is a single player game. The only Spider-man game I can think of that is 2 player is called Spider-man: Friend or Foe, but that game is for younger kids than this one...hope that helps. This game by the way...is really good...my kids love it.
I'm wondering about the T rating... what about this game makes it worth a "T"- considering it for an 8 yr old
This should cover your questions: http://www.esrb.org/ratings/synopsis.jsp?Certificate=29480
Is Black cat in this game?
No she isn't. I don't think she is even mentioned.
How would this compare to other mechanical keyboards? So, out of these, which do you guys recommend?
I agree with Duc. All the latest mechanical keyboards use the same switches from Cherry, so they're give the same basic feel. In terms of price, the Razer keyboards, which use Cherry MX Blue switches seem the best and combined with the macro software is a rather great choice. I have two Filco Majestouch keyboards, one with Cherry MX Brown (tactile, but not clicky) and one with Cherry MX Blue (tactile + clicky) switches. In my opinion, I feel that the Cherry MX Brown switches are better for typing, but they're easier to fat finger, Blues are better for gaming as it's harder to mistype a key. The only thing is Cherry MX Brown switches are harder to come by in the US, but both Filco, which are now purchasable on Amazon via a merchant and the Das S Silent utilize said switches.
what color is the switches?
Supposively they are Cherry blues, but they fail so often in this keyboard that I'm not convinced this information is true. Had three of them, all three had their switches fail after about a month. I have three other keyboards with Cherry switches and none of them has that problem.
What colour is the back light?
The only back light there is on this keyboard is the Razor logo. It's only Blue, but you can turn it off, make it pulsate on and off or just have it in a solid state.
is this the blue LED Razer blackwidow?
No, this is the non backlit one. the blue razer icon is lit though
Are the newest models still having trouble with the spacebar-alt issues?
I do know of at least one person on the notebook review forums that has one and loves it...HOPEFULLY they're better now. I have heard of a lot of problems with Rosewell's, and even some with Das Keyboard, soooo I don't know what the heck to buy!
Is the keyboard limited to light blue as its only back-lit color?
Standard Blackwidow Ultimate has only blue with five intensity levels. There are other versions that give other colors (Dragon Age 2 with red and Battlefield 3 with orange), but each keyboard can only give one color at a time.
Noisy Typing? Can you tell me if this is louder or quieter then your normal keyboard?
It's a loud keyboard the Cherry MX Blues have a distinct clicking sound
spacebar issues? Letter R? Glossy? Does your space bar work?
The space bar issue is one that can occur to the space, shift, keypad +, keypad enter and keypad insert keys. The problem is that underneath said keys there is a thin rod running across with 2 little plastic parts holding the rod onto the key itself. This supports the wider key size, but when one of the little plastic parts pops out of the underside of the key, it will block the keys downward motion and will not allow the key to depress evenly, as the rod is only attached on one side. You will hear a rattle if you give it a shake. Pay shipping costs and wait for Razer to click the key back onto its rod then send it back, or just do it yourself... The issue is bound to happen some day- I hope this will be of some use to someone.
Can anyone confirm this uses Cherry MX Blues?
Yes, it does.
The used keyboards come in how good of quality when you buy them?
Since they are used keboards it would entirely depend in the vendor selling you the keyboard. The black widow is pretty durable so unless they were very careless with it I would say there is a good chance they are in good to excellent quality.
Is the backlighting blue or green?
Blue
Now. Im in the US can I have ti come in the UK layout instead? or? What?
Hey Brandon, since it is a mechanical keyboard you can rearrange some buttons, you will have to reprogram the keyboard using Razer's Synapse software
Does this use cherry MX blue switches?
They are blues up until this years model which uses new custom Razer "green" switches as a replacement.
The keyboard has the letter &Ntilde;??
This is not the Spanish version.
What is the switch type?
Cherry mx blue
is comfortable this mouse with a claw grip?
Absolutely, had it for about two and a half years now and I'm a claw grip gamer, no complaints about comfort or button accessibility.
I have 6.5 inch hands, and I like to use a fingertip grip. Would this mouse suit me?
Sounds like you have roughly the same size hands as myself. I think you could comfortably use this mouse. It is slightly bigger than a standard mouse, and a decent bit bigger than most wireless mice. My favorite thing about this mouse is how comfortably it sits in hour hand after using for several hours.
If i lift the mouse, it will stop response for a good 5-15 seconds, this is my concern
This is not a question, but what I'll try to help you anyway. If you lift the mouse off of you mode pad or desk or whatever, then it will stop functioning while you have it in the air. Once you set the mouse back down, it immediately begins working again. The laser only works when it is close to something.
Dimensions? Any maybe some sort of fruit, for scale.
Approximately 13 centimeters in length, 8 centimeters width at the widest point, and 4.5 centimeters tall. Maybe a large apple or small grapefruit for length, kiwi for height, and width of a large banana maybe?
Windows 8 is not on the supported list, can someone who has Windows 8 confirm if it works?
it worked for me,........windows 8.1
Can you reprogram any of the buttons? Including the dpi switch, profile switcher, and macro key?
Yes you can reprogram the buttons to certain options listed in the software, but the Storm tactic button (thumb button on the side) you can't change it for another function; however, Storm Tactics button allows you to set combinations built to offer 32 extra button outputs for macros, scripts, rapidfire which is useful for mmo games. There is a profile switcher button underneath the scroll wheel as well.
is it wireless and does it work with windows 8.1
It is not wireless and yes it supports all versions of windows XP or later so yes 8.1 to.
What's the lowest dpi this mouse can be set at?
lowest is 500 highest is 4000 here is a picture of the dpi http://tinypic.com/?t=postupload
Do the programmable buttons work on Mac OSX ?
This was a gift for my grandson who does have a Mac OSX. He is a gamer, I believed he liked it a lot and have NOT had any problems with it.

the controllers come with the battery and charging cable? and come in black color?
No, they come with 2 double A (AA) alkaline batteries. The rechargeable battery pack and charging cable is an additional $20. That's for any controller, old or new.
Does it include receiver for PC?
http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Windows/dp/B004QRKWKQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408137095&sr=8-1&keywords=xbox+360+controller+wireless+pc does but this one does not. It's only a few dollars more (at the time I'm posting) so probably worth just doing that.
I just got 2. I turned them on and their power buttons just blink - they don't connect. I tried hitting the console power button, too. What do I do??
There is a small black button on the console above the USB port that you push. Then you press the sync button on the controller as well and they should sync
I have the PC receiver, will this controller work with the PC receiver? Thanks
Yes, it should work if you have the correct PC receiver to go with the controller.
Will this work on Amazon fire TV games
Nope, it only works for xbox 360 console.
This controller is original or is the cheapest ones ?
This is a original xbox 360 wireless controller
Is this the "Transforming D-Pad" version?
No it is not just the regular wireless one, try the Camo controller its good
Will the controller work with my surface RT updated to 8.1 ?
Yes
Does the Xbox One support 360 controllers?
No
Will the play and charge kit work with this charger if I already have one?
Since I don't have a play-and-charge kit, the following is my informed opinion. Yes, it will work assuming you have the rechargeable batteries installed in the controller. I looked at the bottom/back of my wireless controller and noted it has the input for this (http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/accessories/batterieschargers/xbox360playchargekit). Finally, this is from Xbox 360's support page describing the use of the kit: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/how-to-use-xbox-360-play-and-charge-kit. Hope this helps.
Does this work on a xbox 360
Yes.
Does this work with Windows 8.1 computers?
Yes it does. Simply plug and play
is this an official microsoft controller?
Yes. It came in the original Microsoft box and everything.
Is the end cable USB or do i need a USB dongle for PC use?
The controller comes with a USB adapter, so you do not need anything for PC use! I also use it for PC games only.
Does the wired controller can connet to PC through USB directly? or I need other tool support ?
Just plug and play.
Does the wired version have a transforming d-pad?
No, but you can change it. The old d- pad for the new one. It only cost like 8 dollars.
Can I plug a head set, in this case turtle beaches, in the controller itself?
Yes.
Is this original one?
Yes it is. It works perfectly on Xbox 360 and on PC
Does this work with PC?
Yes it does.
Does this work with the Skyrim Legendary PC game?
Sure does
I lost my charger. Now what? What kind of AC adapter can i use?
I would try like a nokia phone charger. thats what it resembles most to me
what is the battery life and how far can you be away from the ps3 before losing service?
Battery life after a year of usage and taking good care is about 5 hours continuous. I can get 30 feet+ away (line of sight), but never needed to go outside the house with it. Concrete walls will block the signal like any wireless device. Mine only charges when plugged into a device that is turned on. I'd like to have 2. So one is charging while the other is in use wirelessly.
what is the battery life and how far can you be away from the ps3 before losing service?
My kids use it they charge it over night and while they @ school.so I'd say they play for 7 hours on 1 charge and get reception on the whole first floor of our house
Will this work with a phone also was just wondering
Yep
Does this product work with the PS4? I have one and can't figure out if it works.
Works property well if you configure it as the way 2 be Usually all Gioteck EX02s Bluetooth Headset for Playstation woks fine Go to setting and configurate Bluetooth advice your psp4 find it and follow all the instruction do not skip steps if you want good quality sound and reception
does it work with PS4 ?
I doubt it. The software you need to configure it doesn't even work with a 64 bit version of Windows. Don't buy this product.
Does it come with 3.0 firmware pre-installed?
Yes, mine did.
I have a corsair k70 rgb and razer deathadder chroma, will it work with this? I heard some peripherals do not work.
There's a pattern with peripherals with a lot of custom options that don't seem to work with the eagle eye. To my knowledge and experience, buttons that are added other than standard buttons from a company to both mouse and keyboard won't be accessible by the eagle eye's software. For example your razer deathadder chroma's side buttons, will not be compatible with the eagle eye, same for the keyboard; but the keyboard and mouse should work fine, but remember, only the standard buttons of a mouse and keyboard will work. Hope this helps. Best to luck!
Can you play Destiny on this mouse and keyboard in PS3?
Yes
Can I use my Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo? I thinks its useless to have wires across living room floor. PS3 controllers are wireless it should too.
There is wireless console for PS4 (keyboard and mouse). for PS3 only this i tried. But logically if the wired keyboard+mouse works , then the wireless should works too but not the combo one . Wireless keyboard need to be in seperate USB adapter from the wireles mouse. And make sure that wireless keyboard and mouse does not require any specific software driver installation
How is it compared to keymander?
I don't know as I've never heard of Keymander until now. Only thing I can suggest is to find reviews on both. I will say the Eagle Eye works well and is configurable for all the PS3 buttons and sensitivity, so it gets a thumbs up from me. ;) Hope that helps.
Can i use this and play MW3 on the ps3 with the Eagle Eye?
Yes you can as well as other fps games.
Can the firmware be upgraded with a 64bit OS yet? (For when 4.0 comes out) I have read reviews saying that it take a 32bit OS to upgrade firmware
It ran on my 64bit Windows 7 just fine.
I HATE STEAM - it is as bad as YELP - is this the only way?
When I bought my copy half of the so-called included dlc wasn't available so had to contact sega - who gave me a new steam key to download it correctly. So if my experience is anything to go by, it's vital you have steam.
Empire total war installed great but when I finshed installing Napoleon total war it said "an error occur when updating Napoleon total war" plez help
Check your memory. You might not have enough
Does this game require STEAM in order to play it, like simple campaign mode?
Yes it does
I did not see a manual in the box, and now I don't have a validation code that the game is requiring before I can play. Can I get a manual?
There is no manual. These days, game manufacturers cut as many corners as they can (not like the '90s, gaming's golden era); instead there are various tutorials. Anyway, to your question - the validation code is on a small strip of paper glued to the inside of the box. It's really hard to miss.
Is it required to have a steam account to run game or can you run it in a stand alone without internet access?
The cd inside will only point you to download steam it does not have the game. You will then have to create an account. After that you spend the next 3-6 hours waiting on the game to download from steam. Once downloaded you will have to launch the game through steam but, you are allowed to use it in "offline mode" if you do not want to stay connected to steam to play the game.
Why did you guys make it so hard to do ANYTHING with this game OR steam?
Hi Ken. This game and steam both have big learning curves. Even if you know what you are doing, plan on a full day of prep before you want to play. In theory you could install and play in the same day, but I find my enjoyment is much greater if I wake up and can go play without having to deal with steam and sega. Plus these games are just ok anyways. I recommend TW Medieval Kingdoms--you dont need steam and it has the best mod of any TW game: Third Age. In my opinion that mod is the peak of the Total War gaming experience. I think this once great franchise was ruined by greed and the need of some people to control others. Cheers.
will Empire and Napoleon Total War Collection - Game of the Year (PC DVD) [UK work in the us ?
Yes it will. I have a 2010 model laptop with Windows 7, and the game runs just fine in the US. Actually, it works better than the original individual games (I got this one for the expansion features).
ZSNES/NES/N64 Emulator Compatibility: Can anyone who has used this with old gen system emulators post about their experience using this with those progs?
The controller works with pretty much any emu you use. i had a little trouble getting kega fusion to recognize it, but after switching the controller to direct input and restarting the emulator, it finally worked p.s., if you haven't bought the controller yet, don't. it's plagued with latency and connection issues. don't be convinced by all the 5 star reviews on this site. do some forum research on google and you'll know what im talking about. as long as you're directly in front of the reciever, no more than 6 feet away, with absolutely no objects in the line of sight between controller and receiver, you'll be fine.
Any Ubuntu Linux users? I'd like to buy this for my Ubuntu 13.10 gaming rig.
It works great. If you want to map the buttons, use xboxdrv. It's in the Ubuntu main repository.
How does this compare in physical size to the PS3 controller? I'm looking for a controller smaller than the 360 one, hopefully PS3 size.
To me this feels right in the middle between the Xbox controller size and the PS controller size.
Will this work on an a newer iMac?
yes you just need to go to Logitech website site and download the latest drivers for mac
Do I have to set the buttons to play games like assassin creed 3 will this controller have already default setting just like consoles style
There are pre-set configurations for the most popular games available with the software drivers. Once you load the pre-configured layout you can customize it.
Do they come with batteries, if so what size, brand and/or type of battery?
2 AA batteries.
When in Xinput mode does a computer recognize it as a wireless Xbox 360 controller or a wired Xbox 360 controller?
Wired, I think.
does it work with windows 8
If you windows 8 installed the drivers uninstall it from the "device manager" and install using the CD and run compatibility for windows 7... if that's not the case... try installing the drivers manually using .inf file or controller files
Has anyone used the 710 Gamepad on a windows 8.1 system?
Yes. I've played several modern games using the X-mode and older emulators in D-mode. Both work without any issues.
will this work with 64bit os?
Yes; it is plug-and-play on both 32- and 64-bit OS.
does the playstation move quad dock pro come with controllers
No it does not. you use your controllers but it works to charge two at a time
Is it 110~240V ?
Yes, I use it with 220V and work very well!!
Will this charge a controller with the silicone sleeve attached?
The controller might, it depends how thick the skin is. It won't for the move controllers for sure.
My PS3 Move Quad Dock Pro has just stopped working, the power cord is malfunctioning it's not charging, where can I get another power cord.
Most electronics stores have power cables just take your old one in with you so you can match up the specs i.e volts amps watts
does it plug into a wall outlet or does it have to be pluged into to ps3 station?
It plugs into the wall outlet.
Can this be used to charge PS4 controllers?
I realy don't know I was just using it for PS3. Sorry I could not help you with my answer.
Can this be used to charge a single Sixaxis controller?
1, 2 or have all 4 hooked up at the same time. It's stated in the description.
It shows that it can charge one motion controller and one navigation controller. Do 2 motion controllers fit?
No, it only allows one of each. However, there is an extra usb connection that allows a cable to be used for charging another motion controller
what games can i use with the head sets
Seriously? It is used for Xbox 360. The headset works for that system , not a specific game
How durable is the cord.
Better than I expected.
Does it hook into the controller or the Xbox?
Hooks into the controller.
Can i hear the gaming sound and friends chat on the headset
HI, this headset is ONLY for chatting. You do NOT hear the sounds from the Game
Can you hear your own voice when talking?
Yea it's a echo it happens it means the other person as there mic to close to there tv or there mic it to loud and it's repeating what you say!!
I bought 3 for my grandsons. They are playing on 2 xbox 360's in same house. All 3 headsets are skipping when they talk to each other. Any idea why
Being close to 1 another with the headphones will cause skipping.
How durable for 9 dollar headset is it?
It's durable however it doesn't work for the system.
Why do these only cost $5 and all the other xbox 360 wireless headphones are like $50-100?
Well, these are less quality then the other high tech headsets. I think mainly because you can't hear in game sounds through them.
Can I just plug it to a PC and listen to music and videos?
No
How long is the cord?
Two feet. It plugs directly into your controller so it's not meant to be long.
IS THIS KEYBOARD COMPATIBLE WITH MAC
Some features work out of the box, such as the normal keys, the audio jack, the media keys and the USB hub. Other features require the software which is not available for MAC. Meaning it's a waste of money if you have a MAC... because you won't get the advanced features out of it.
is there any backlight? and how does it do compared with the Mad Catz Strike 3. good for BF4? Thank, oh and can i set the color of the light?
No backlighting besides the steel series name on top, can't tell u how it is compared to the mad catz never owned it, but FYI this isn't a mechanical key keyboard the benefit of the keyboard is the switchable key sets
is it wireless?
No
Can you send this product to Argentina?, price is $35 dollars? pls confirm me, thanks. Could you put a really image of the product?.

Ok, thanks for response, I want to buy the Shift Keyboard in order to put my Starcraft Key set. Do you sell this Shift Keyboard? New or Used? thanks.
Used with some scratches on the bottom right. Awesome for Starcraft 2 I have wings of liberty set brand new in box and a used one only used twice. Macros work great too!
Is the Shift Gaming Keyboard or Keyset gaming Keyboard?. I have the Starcraft II keyset and need the SHIFT keyboard in order to it works. Thanks.
We bought the Key Set first and realized we needed the actual Keyboard. The keyboard we bought had a generic key set with it, we just added our World of Warcraft keyset to the key board.
Is this good for LoL? I want to get my friend something quality and that will work with LoL
No do not buy this key board the software is broken, get a G510
steelseries SHIFT keyboard: DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I can find "how to" instructions/procedures?
In your start menu (no idea for mac) there is the steelseries folder. Check there and the user manual is in it. Also if you right click the steelseries icon it's there as well. Did you experience any issues with the engine install after a reboot? 2 others here have had it freeze up. Good luck!

what is wii nib
New In Box
is it game cube controller compatable
The Red Wii with New Super Mario Bros. is a great system. I got one for Christmas and yes, it has 4 ports for Nintendo GameCube controllers, which is great to play Smash Bros. Brawl. It also plays GameCube games such as Smash Bros. Melee and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. There is also a place for Nintendo GameCube Memory Cards so you can save your GameCube game progress if you have Memory Cards. I'd definitely recommend the Red Wii.
Can this particular model play GameCube games?
Absolutely,the red Wii is backwards compatible. I did have to buy a Gamecube controller and memory card. Not all Wii's are able to play Gamecube games but this model does.
Does this version (the physical PC version) require Origin or Steam?
It does not require it but be aware you can only use your code once. I had to uninstall my game and contacted them for help reinstalling it. He said it would be so easy to just do it online but failed to mention I had to install origin on my computer and download it and all my expansion packs which took forever! It is nice to register the game and get a origin account incase anything happens but I did not have WiFi on my computer ans played the game many years without making a account.
My sister would like to play it but she has a windows 8, could she?

Of course, go perfect
do you have to pay a monthly fee to play?
no, is not a multiplayer game.
can you use a mouse to play this game?
I don't have a real mouse but the one on my lap top you should be able to use a real one tho the game is for pc. Also once you get the game read the manual it will show you game controls if you don't like some of them you can pause (spacebar) and go to settings to change game controls.
What are the system requirements?
intel 2 core 1.6ghz or amd athlon64 2.0ghz or faster, windows xp, vista, 7 32/64bit, 1gb ram or 1.5gb ram for vista/7, dvd 8x, 24gb hd, 128mb xp / 256mb vista/7 video card, sound card dx9c compatible, mouse and keyboard

It took me several try's for the download and installation process to work properly. For some reason it almost stops downloading early or is interrupted and misses things. Colonization is downloaded first, I figure. If you delete everything and install again from Amazon it will eventually fall into place. Extremely frustrating but it will work. Amazon should let you use the same code for a few days. They let me anyway.
I am buying for a Christmas gift. Does it have to be downloaded when purchased or can I purchase now for my grandson to download after Christmas?
As long as he has the download code, he can download it at his convenience, tomorrow or next year or whenever! :D

Yes, any number of your own troops can occupy the same space.
can more than one unit occupy the same space of land at a time?
Yes. And they can be stacked and moved together.
is there a way to get this installed through steam?
No. http://forums.2k.com/showthread.php?117259-Steam-serial
Are the expansion sets already installed when you open the game or do they get launched independently?
I recently installed them and they open independently.
Can you play this on Microsoft 8.1?
Yes I'm playing it right now with 8.1
If we get a download code, where do we download it? Don't want to use steam if possible?
There isnt a dl code it just downloads from amazon
Can I download this game to a flash drive to install on another computer?
I don't know why not. It is about 2 Gig. I downloaded it at my cabin and then took it home on a external drive. I had no problems.
How come it says it has 4 games but when i download I only have 1?

Do I have to have the regular sims 3 game in order to get this, or is this a game within itself?
It's an expansion pack of the base game. It needs the base game in order to work.
I accidentally bought the wrong one, what should I do?

If I bought the download, would I be able to install it on my PC and my laptop? Or would I have to buy two copies?
You can install it on both
How do you find the registration code?
Under 'My account' go to the 'Your games & software' and they should list your download code there. Then you redeem that code with Origin to start your download. But make sure you do it on the Origin client app not on the sim website, otherwise it won't work.
can you have both 2 and 3 on the computer at the same time?
Yep! You should have no problem having them both on your computer. Running them at the same time, however, might cause some difficulties with processing speed/graphic rendering.
does this work on kindle fire
It's an expansion pack for the PC.

what pixel is this camera
i think its a 1.3? i have it and the picture isnt really bad.
Just to make sure. Can it work on PSP 1001?
0peration depends on software in use , 6.00 or later is required . usb connector on top is universal on all models . Camera may not be recognized if usb is dusty , just clean off with a dry Qtip if needed .
Can you please tell the dimensions of the shipping packet or box of this item.
9-1/4" x 6-1/4" x 2"
is this an actual psp player or an accessory?
It is an accessory. It is a camera that attaches to the top of the actual PSP player. I personally did not like this product. I received a defective one. The latest model of the PSP is the 3001 slim type the into your search bar.
is it the same as the camera for eyepets?
yes
dose it work with the pspvita
No, this will not work with the Vita. This camera uses mini-usb which is not a port that the Playstation Vita supports. With this in mind the PSVita already has a rear and front facing camera making this device not necessary. This camera will really only be used for the PSP-1000 through 3000 models.
can this cam work with the vita system
The PSvita already has a camera installed.
Which one is better this camera or the one from the ps vita?
This camera and the built-in cameras on the Vita are all 640x480. Looking at pictures from both, they're about the same in terms of overall image quality. Not terribly good. (That said, there is a higher-quality camera available for the PSP if you want to import - the 1.3 megapixel Chotto Shot which was never released in North America.)
how many megapixels.. if any...??
I cannot tell you. This is a gift that I bought for a young man who lives in Haiti and is not fluent in English. He could not possible help you either.
Can I run Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 on MAC OS X 10.9.5?? Also, Do I need a video card?
Yes it will run on mavericks (10.9.5). Your mac already has a video card built into the hardware, no need to upgrade it for RCT 3.
I just have one question. I recently got a mac a few months ago. The version of my mac is 10.9.2, will this game work on it?
I have updated my system straight through from 10.6 to 10.9, and it has never not worked. It should be fine.
Will this run in Leopard running on a *PowerPC* architecture iBook?
The lowest OS it will run on is 10.3, and a G4/G5 power pc. See what generation PowerPC you are. It'll be slow on an iBook, I have it running on an 07 Mac mini with intel processor and it runs smooth for the most part, but it's does use a lot of ram and lags a bit at those times.
Does RCT3 run on OS Mavrick?
It should run on maverick, the lowest os it'll run on is 10.5 leopard.
Will this game work on the Windows 8 operating system?
Yes. I use Windows 8. Keep in mind the LA PD mod. It adds a nice Los Angeles feel to the game.
does it have editors mod included?
No the editor is not included
will this work on window 7
Yes, it will, on my PC with windows 7, it has glitches to play a small screen size, smaller than my monitor
can the game install
Yeah. Works fine
hi, i couldnt change the language, please help me!
I do not believe you can. 911 First Responders is the United States version of the game because for some reason they couldn't use the original name here. In other countries it's called Emergency 4. Maybe you can find a version of Emergency 4 in your language.
can i change the language??
Yes
How do you make the mod installer work for this game?
when you down load the mod if its a rar file or a zip file you must extract it then go into the properties of the game click and drag it into the mod folder for 911 first responder! You must restart the computer after it has been done! if you need more help I an help you!
What mods don't require the mod installer?
A lot of mods are just drag and drop into the mod folder, which is located in the main directory for 911FR
How do you fix the mod installer and download mods for windows 8.1?
You can't... the amazon download never came with it. The LA mod and a few others don't use the mod installer so you can get those
Why doesnt the LA mod work?
It does, read the manual it comes with on installing the mod. They have a PDF on how to
Will it work with the PS4? Mainly for FF14. Thanks
Yes, I have friends that use them on PS4 for FF14.
Does it come in the Razer box and does it have all the pieces and paperwork included that it would have if it came from the website?
Yes, it ships as it would had it shipped directly from the manufacture.
Is the Naga Epic OSX (mac) compatible? It says here on the amazon page that it is not but I checked the Razer website and it says it is OSX compatible
Absolutely! My son uses it on his Mac
How long does the battery last and is it replaceable?
It's a rechargeable battery. This is not like most mice I've had that comes with a nub you plug into the laptop and takes regular batteries that last about a year. This comes with a battery like your cell phone would take. You plug the mouse into a charging cradle and then can play wireless, but the cradle has to stay plugged in. The battery charge will only last a day (several hours), and then you'll either have to charge the mouse in the cradle or switch to the wired version. The battery is replaceable.
Does the epic have the TILT scroll wheel just like the epic chroma?
Yes, all versions of the naga have tilt scroll wheels
Do you notice any latency between clicking and games responding? I have had terrible wireless gaming mouse experience.
Sorry, my mouse is not wireless so I can't answer that. I don't like to click and have nothing happen or have the battery die at inopportune times.
How wide is it with the biggest side panel on?
Not as wide as I hoped, its ok but at times I have issues. Would love if it was wider.... Not for very large hands but it's use able.
This item can ship to Brazil? If yes how much to shiping?
We do not ship out of the States. Thanks!
when you recieve the box will the box be the regular razer box or an amazon box, and will it have a wire to play wired itstead of wireless.
Normal box and it come wired or wireless which ever one u want
doe sit come in the regular razer box when you get it
He's it does
Is this mouse good with shooters/rpg?
Yes. It works pretty well with shooters, and or RPGs.
Is this the special edition Naga?
Well one my best friends has that mouse. I have the original and the 2012 version so far. Really only major difference is graphics on the mouse and not sure if molten is hand size customizable. 2012/2013 standard Razer is.
Does it get hot? With the way it's shaped it seems like it would get a little hot...
Even during intense raiding (4 hours no break) it would never get hot. Very well built. There is a reason every top gamer uses razer.
Can I use the 12 button thumb grid function other than gaming. For example, I'm using Pro Tools and there's a lot of shortcuts to remember?
I primarily used it for gaming (just using the 1-12 buttons for 1 through 0, - and =). There is a way to Configure Razer mouse settings on Razer Synapse 2.0 but I never used it. I hate to misinform you, so I would research what you can do with Synapse 2.0 or go to the Razer website and ask support directly. Have a good day.
This may sounds like a silly question, but is the LED color changeable? Or are you stuck with whatever color it comes in.
Not that I'm aware of.
Is there a warranty with this mouse?
It says it has a 2 year limited warranty and free online technical support.
Does this work on Mac?
Yes, to my belief the retail box does say this is Mac compatible.
is this compatible with windows 8
Yes it's compatible with Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.
Ok, so this may sound lame, but what does MMO mean, and is this wireless?
mmo = massively multiplayer online, basically games like world of warcraft, rift, star wars old republic are mmo's. This particular model of the razer naga is not wireless. However it gives you plenty of cord length to move around freely. This one is wireless -----&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Razer-Rechargable-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B004AM5RAM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384215398&sr=8-1&keywords=naga+wireless+mouse
Is the size/shape of this one the same as the Naga MMO? I have that one and like it a lot.
Sure is.
Does this work on PS4?
I'm not 100% sure but if the ps4 is able to connect with Bluetooth devices then it should work. Any device that is able to connect by bluetooth can work with this mic. I use it for my phone, ps3 and I plan to use it once I get a ps4.
I have one of these I got from a friend but no charger what kind of cable does it require to connect to headset?
A standard headset will connect.
Does it come with the charger?
No. it only comes with a USB cable. Hook up to USB to charge.
is it just chat
Yea
This is compatible with HTC for calls, music, etc.
It works with my nokia phone
Does it come with the charger?
No it does not just USB cable that plugs into the system
does this Wii controller come with motion plus ?
No, It is just a standard remote.
Will the battery packs from the Energizer charging system fit these? It's too big for all but our original remote.
It fits just fine.
Does this remote come with the Motion Plus built in? Or would I have to buy the adapter separately?
Hello, the Wii remote is just the normal version so you have to buy the adapter separately.
The product description says, and I quote, "It contains the same motion-sensing technology as the remote" is this a false description? If so? Report?
It says that, but when I tried to connect it to the WII it would act like it registered, then when I selected two player in a game, a screen popped up and told me to reconnect the remote. I repeated this 5 times and it never connected.
I bought this for my grandson's Wii. IT WILL NOT SYNC!!!!! I tried to sync it to two other Wii units and IT WILL NOT SYNC!!!! What do I do?
They dont sync right. Mine do not sync either. Took a chance and got burned.
how can i get a refund?! my wii remote is just a block of plastic. i want my money back!
call amazon customer service, they should be able to help you
Can I connect a Wii classic controller pro to the remote?
Yes
Do these work alright?
They are not OEM but work pretty good
Does this works with the WII Mini?
Yes, I'm currently using it with the mini. You just have to Sync it.
So you have to buy something else for Motion Plus? I thought it says it rubmles. What is the adapter?
Motion plus is built in. You do not need anything additional.
It doesn't seem to accept HDMI input which is what an Xbox One has. Not sure it will work there?
you are correct. this cable doesn't have HDMI.
Are new cables supposed to come in a box or just in a plastic bag? I just got them in a plastic bag and wanted to make sure they aren't used.
I've had a lot of cables from amazon come in a sealed plastic bag, usually in an amazon box. If your ever worried its used, look at the ends that plug into the console for verticle lines. Mine were brand new, still smelled of fresh plastic. I love this cord. Been using it for about 2 years now. If you have it hooked up to 2 consoles at once, you will get an image but no sound. Just unplug it from the unused console. I use it on my ps3 and it still let's me use 1080p on my HD TV. I had origionaly bought them for an older projection TV, but have since gotten a flat screen, and still use them, don't even need to get an HdMI. I have compared the 2, the HDMI is almost worse because its so sharp, the edges are a little too cut.
Will it work with ps4?
No
It seems like the other 1 in 1 PS2 component cables don't play PS1 games if hooked up to a HDTV. So does this one do the job?
This one plays all my games on ps2. The ps1 games work on ps2
Will this fit SCPH-70012 PS2 Slim models? Asking because I see various people saying it fits their PS2 Slim and some that say theirs do not.
It works for me. As far as i know, all ps2's have the same video output connector type
why cant i get sound when i hook up my ps2?
If you have it plugged into multiple systems at the same time, it will sometimes do that. try only having the ps2 plugged in and see if that fixes it
am I doing something wrong? the cable doesn't work
Probably, mine works perfect. You will need to provide more info about the setup for someone to give a meaningful answer.
Will it work with an Original Xbox (Very first Xbox)?
No only 360
Have the Xbox 360. Do not see how the cable hooks up to the gaming console. None of the slots fit any of the cable.
It is the proprietary port that is a trapezoidal shape right next to the hdmi port on mine.
We have an xbox one and these cables do not work?
It's for Xbox 360, not Xbox One.
How does the billing work? Is it monthly,every 3 months. Please let me know?
You buy the game outright from amazon. It is not like the other game companies that charge you every month.
will they play on Windows 7?
I have them on my computer (windows 8) but I play them in windows 7 mode. So I would say yes to windows 7.
Do these games play on Windows 7? It says for XP
Yes, it plays on Windows 7, which is my operating system.

One of my sons has an Xbox One,and the other has an xBox 360. Do we need 2 xbox live accounts or one?
You will need 2 accounts. Doesnt matter if they have a xbox 360 or an xbox one. If they both want to have their own profile and play at the same time they need to have an account
What is inside of here ? And does the xbox live gold pass come includes as a kit ?
We got the headset, the keypad, 400 Microsoft points, and a year subscription to xbox. Great deal.
Where is the xbox live code. I don't see it in the box?
It should be on a 1 page sheet of glossy paper, or on a thicker green card
does xbox live have parental controls
It would be under the account of the user, nothing to do with online access.
Can a single LIVE account be used for Xbox 360 and Xbox ONE? Can this headset be used for Xbox One?
Yes, a single account serves on both consoles. This headset will not work on the Xbox One nor will the keyboard.
Do you have to provide a credit card to use this?
Just to buy it... It's an attachment for the hand controller of your Xbox 360 so you can text faster it comes with a one year subscription to Xbox live and very basic headset.
Does this kit work in other countries too? We live in Amsterdam.
I read the fine print and only one problem may be looking at you, here it is, quote " points can only be redeemed by member accounts based in the country of purchase. " so if there's no local shipment center in your country then the points may be useless, there was no warning/caution on the 12 month card except for this one, quote "not available in all countries, see www.xbox.com/live/countries ". Now onto the physical goods, the chat pad works anywhere but only with a xbox 360 control, that said if bought from a foreign seller then the default keyboard may not be in your language or preference, you can check by looking at the back of the chat pad, if in English you're ok. Now onward to the mic, this should work on any control with a 2.5 headphone jack standard on every licensed xbox 360 control. Overall all should be good if bought from a local distributor.
Are the chat pad and headset wireless?
They need to be plugged in you XBOX 360 controller So if your controller is wireless then yes
If I buy this now, how will the points work since Microsoft changed the point system into currency instead?
The micropoints for the xbox 360 will convert to real money and I don't know how much but I am pretty sure it will still work for you to buy some arcade games, music, videos, etc. If you buy this product you will be very satisfied once you get it. No need to worry about the microsoft points that will be convert to real money so theres no change since the Microsoft has change the points to real money.
will the keyboard/mic work on an xbox 1?
no... this is patric!

What do you put the headset into USB or audio jack?
Audio jack but you can buy an external sound card that makes it USB if that's what your worried about.
Is it usb plugged?
Nope, 3.5mm although I'm sure you can find a converter.
Compatible with Mac?
not sure but the mic is crap. hard to hear you, makes it sound like you are talking threw a pillow.
how long is the cord?
I don't have an exact measurement for you but its long enough for me to be able to walk and get something in my room without taking my headset off. To be fair though, i have a small-ish room
Do these work well with Xbox360 if i get a USB converter?
Don't buy it. Mine fell apart.
This can connect to the PC as well to charge right?
Yep but you can't play with the play & charge kit on the Pc it is just for Xbox
Do you have to purchase backs with it to work? in other words what does it connect to?
the cable directly connects straight into the xbox controller. if you have a charging battery pack it will charge the battery otherwise it will power the controller without the need for batteries.
if you plug this into a pc can u still use controller?
Yes I believe that should be okay as long as its syncd to whatever it is your using
if i plug without batteries can i play?
Yes, then it is just a corded controller.
does it come with battery
Yes it comes with a battery.. However the battery does not operate without it being plugged in. It's an aftermarket battery.
When I plug the cable into the controller the green light quickly turns on and off. Has this happened to anyone else?
Yes
Will this work with the rechargeable energizer battery pak?
no it dont charge things just makes them turn on when the cord is hooked up
can I use it with rechargeable AA bateries?
No
first or third person perspective
3rd person.
how does it compare to Naughty dogs Uncharted trilogy?
it is just as good as uncharted . very enjoyable& fun to play.
why is it rated m for mature
There's blood and gore, intense violence, and strong language. That's why I believe it's rated M for mature
Hi, is this compatible with ps4 console?
No it is for the PS3
How much gore and eschatology does it have? Can it be reduced/censored?
It does have gore in it. If I remember correctly there is not a lot of cursing. It is not for a younger child. There is no nudity or lewdness. But there is a lot of killing.
How much hard drive space is needed for the ps3 version. It should say at the back of the case.
It says it requieres 5.2 MB
Do I need to play any other Tomb Raider games to understand this one?
You do not, this is a reboot of the franchise and this game is the origin story for Lara.
Can you recommend games for 8 year olds?
Sorry i dont know any.
This game is Spanish or subtitled in Spanish?
I have this game in english with no spanish subtitle .
Hey guys! So I was thinking of buying Tomb Raider but I hear there's multiple games in the series. Is this the first one? What's the order?
No there is a lot of older versions of this game
Since this has a USB jack, does it work on PC? Do both wheel and pedals work for PC?
Yes it works on PC. The gas and brake aren't very accurate though.
Can this be used with Nascar 14? Also, I know it isn't wireless but how close to the TV do you have to be?
As far as NASCAR 14, I don't know the answer to that. I only play Grand Turismo on mine.You don't have to be that close. I can sit down on my couch, and it reaches up to about 10 feet comfortably from the couch to the TV.
does this work with NASCAR 14?
It works with other nascar games, it works very well.
does it work with midnight club
yes and perfectly I should add,you might have to customise your controller in settings I dont rember
does this work for dirt 3?
No
Does it work with Gran Turismo 5 XT?
Yes it does. But the accelerator and brake pedals are made of low gauge plastic combined with poor design and won't with stand a serious adult driver and will crack. I'm happy with my new gran tourismo with an 11inch wheel with realelistic steering radious. And the pedals are made stronger. Worth every penny.
How do you use the foot pedals. I have it hooked up to the PS3 but can't seem to get them to work. The steering wheel is working.....help please.
I have the same issue unfortunately and haven't been able to resolve it. I got a message via Amazon asking if I could answer this question. I jumped on it because I do have this issue, but when I initially got the steering wheel, the foot pedals did work. In fact, they worked until I started messing around with the settings on screen when I was trying out different configurations of the buttons and pedals. The pedals stopped working and I've never been able to get them working again, even after resetting the buttons to factory settings. I would advise doing a warranty return if you're unable to get the pedals working. Sorry I can't offer more help.
Does This Steering Wheel work with "Gran Turismo 6"
Yes it does, im playing on it right now! It plays all ps3 racing games.
How big is it?
Hmm let's see it fits well on our TV tray made of wood standard size TV tray that's what we use it in when my daughter and I play driving games. 11 inches wide, 8 inches tall and 9 inches from front to back. It's sturdy too.
does this work on all racing games even nedd for speed games
Yes it seems to work with all of our games
Will this allow me to download GTA V?
Yup
How do I install the 60gb hard disk drive for Xbox 360?:
On The right side of the Xbox there is one cover. Open it. Place the Hard drive in the space provided, aligning properly and push it. Close the cover.
Does this hard drive come with the caddy as pictured or will I need to buy the hd caddy seperate?
All together
what is the diffrence between a usb xbox 360 memory card and a hard flas disk drive like on this product
Typically this hard drive can run faster and have things downloaded to it faster. But not much. This goes inside of the console which protects it, and it's harder for this to get corrupted files, it's made for the xbox, who knows what could happen in another external drive. Both external and this however can be plugged in from one xbox to another, if you recover your fakery age. The downside of external is you may need to find a place to store it when not in ise. That's about it. Size, convenience in storage, and an ever so slight speed difference
can you use it on the xbox 360 E?
Yes
will this work on the 4GB Xbox 360?
Pretty sure that's what I have. I know it's a 360 and I think it was the smallest storage space when I bought it. It installed just fine once I figured out where it went
Will it be compatible with the 360 slim, i got one once but it crashed.
yes. It works fine and is easy to install. I purchased one for a friend and installed it for him, and it works fine.
Since the Xbox360 slim only comes with 2GB of internal storage, will this allow me to download and play Battlefield 4?
Yes, it is exactly what you need for Battlefield 4.
I have a black xbox 360 S Model 1439. We just got Destiny, which needs a hard drive. Will this do the trick?
Yes it will same reason that we purchased it.
Can I use this model to play Destiny on my xbox 360 slim?
Yes, that is exactly what I use mine for
Which mouse is it? There are 2 different pictures of the mouse.
The first picture is not the correct one.
What are the dimensions of the mouse itself?
The mouse is about 4 inches wide (thumb to pinky), 5.5 inches long (wrist to pointer), and about 2 inches tall (mouse pad to palm). I would say it is kind of a bigger the average mouse, but I fell in love with it extremely quickly. It is one of the best mice for gaming and I have had 0 issues with its compatibility with World of Warcraft.
Does not work with SWTOR
It seems the problem is linked to UAC in Windows 7 and is fixed by disabling it at the moment. From the forum posts it seems both steelseries and bioware is aware of the problem and working on a permanent fix.
unlike the legendary WoW mouse that I just bought and had to return because it some how not compatible with win 8.1, so I guess my question is this?
My first question would be, what game were you using the mouse on? I have found that some games just can't see all the buttons on the mouse, even with the software installed.
Do these work with the wavebird wireless controller? The sticks on the wavebird look the same,but does anyone know for sure if they are.
Yes it does
Does this include the grey cap?
Both yellow and grey thumbsticks are included.
If your joystick is worn out (i.e. stick is wobbly or loose) will this replacement piece fix that?
It will not. A wobbly stick is caused by the joystick box, the thing you plug the rubber piece into. To fix a wobbly stick you either have to get a new controller or solder a different box on.
Is this just one piece or is there a rubber attached to each piece that is removable?
It's just one piece.
Are these easy to install? I would be worried that I do something wrong. I never assembled any controllers before.
Extremely easy if you have the right screwdriver. They snap right in. The C stick may seem like it doesn't fit but it does, you just need to apply light pressure until the stick is firmly down. I had never opened up any of my controllers either and replacing four sets of Wavebird sticks took me less than a half hour.
How many grey caps come in the package?
Just one of each color
do you get 30 days for free ? when you buy this
The game is free to play, it may give you 30 days of 'patron' status, which offers perks and bonuses, none of which is required to play or reach the max level.
If I buy this can I enter a code or something to get the stuff for my current Rift character?
I bought this in 2011, and don't remember enough to give you a good answer. Maybe the vendor can give you a better answer. Best of luck to you!
Does this include stuff from the base game?
Yes it has everything in the base game plus additional items like a mount
If I buy this can I enter a code or something to get the stuff for my current Rift character?
As far as I can understand you can buy this Collector's Edition and add the keycode from the box to your existing account and receive all the different items the Collector's Edition offers. However, if you're only interested in the digital in-game items of this Edition you can upgrade to a Digital Collector's Edition here; https://rift.trionworlds.com/products/view-product?code=RIFT_COLLECTORS_UP_TRION_PRE Hope that helps.
is this game a mmorpg
no its just an RPG. But if you're interested in an online RPG there's Elder Scrolls online. You should check it out.
does this game include the DLC's (hearthfire, dawnguard, and dragonborn)
No. You want this version for everything: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition.
Can you dodge, block, and counter? Do you get health regain rings and necklace, and do you get health steal per hit armor?
You can block on coming attacks with a 2 hand weapon or a shield, and yes there is different wearable items to help regain health, stamina, and magic, plus you can also create different items to help with different parts of the game.
Languages &#x200B;&#x200B;and subtitles that contains the game? Contains DLC? are active? Please !! detail information
this game is in english and subttles and also just in english. It doesn't have DLC, but it's a huge game, you have a would to explore with a lot of quests. If you need to choose a game to play during the year, this is the game that you will spend a year playing. it's worth buying.
Combat seems a bit slow, like old people fighting slow.
Depends on whats class you choose to be Some times it is slow but when there are dozens of enemies or when a dragon comes or a troll things get a bit crazy
Does this game have a multiplayer co-op option?
No it doesn't
The latest patch solve the problems that cause so many 1star ratings? All the glitches and save size problems?
I've never had a single issue with the game. This is with months and months of nonstop playing. Nothing to worry aboot.
Does this game come patched out of the box? Im hoping to exploit a few glitches.
I bought the game about six months after it was released, and there was a large patch available as soon as I installed it. I would imagine that several years later, that's still true and probably a lot more to download.
I see all reviews are from 2011. It's 2015 Have they fixed the bugs in this game yet? Considering purchasing but sounds risk.
I haven't had any bugs with it and I bought it recently.
is it first person or third?
It is both. You can change perspective from your characters eyes, to floating behind and above your character.
MAc
My friend has a Mac; had issue's with it and never got it to work. You don't get the game on the DVD to play offline; just the registration software; it downloads the game from "STEAM". You pay for the right to download a file that may or may not work. Personally due to the problem of corrupt file ext: emailed STEAM 5 time to resolve the problem STEAM deleted my account; and my friends problem with "error unable to read" along with problems from 3 other friends that bought this "Not" a Game DVD I don't recommend this game.
Is this game appropriate for a 12yr old? What are the "sexual themes and alcohol" content in here like the rating says?
Violence is really the only mature content. There is some blood and gore throughout though only with swords, axes, and bows. The worst part is a beheading in the very beginning of the game. The alcohol and sexual themes are very minimal, nothing like grand theft auto.
Do you have to continue buying subscriptions if you buy the CD or does buying the CD give you unlimited time to play?
It gives you unlimited time. The only elder scrolls game that you have to pay a subscription for is The Elder Scrolls Online.
To activate you need a steam account, why/
No big deal. Do it and forget about it. No consequences whatsoever. In fact, I don't even remember having to do it.
Does it work on a computer with Windows 8.1 ?
Yes and it runs very well.
As a new player what should I know going into this game? Any recommendations or suggestions?
Nexus Mods has a lot of fun additions to Skyrim, including unofficial and comprehensive patches that fix a lot of the bugs. SkyUI, SKSE, FNIS and XP3 Skeleton come highly recommended.
what is steam requirement?
It means that Skyrim runs through the Steam software. If you already have it it'll add the game to your Steam library, if you don't have it it will install Steam on your PC alongside the game.
Bored with Everquest...Is ES V Skyrim a stand alone game? Or must I purchase the earlier installments?
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a completely standalone game from the rest in the series. The story does not even continue, it's unique in that way. However, if you have played the other Elder Scrolls games, you'll find a few easter eggs here and there. With the bonus of mods, the expansion and re-playability of this game is virtually endless.
I have an ASUS 15.6-Inch HD Intel Dual-Core Laptop, Core i3, 6GB RAM, laptop. Does anyone know is this will run Skyrim ok?
I have a Hp pavilion and it works perfect but if you have played it on desktop you might find it wierd because of the distance or lack of but the quality is just the same as on my desktop
Do you have to insert the CD into the computer every time you play (like Sims) or is it just used for downloading the game?
Its a downloaded game. It runs through Steam and is very easy to install! You can use Steam for most downloaded games. Its a Great copy
Charging stations can use rechargeable batteries nimh?
no. the item comes w/ the base for charging the 2 batteries that it comes with. the batteries are for the controllers only, they're pictures in the image for sale. The batteries themselves are inside the plastic backing which is impossible to take apart. hope that helps
Does this work with the motion plus remotes?
Yes
can someone help me im trying to get them to sync
There is a tiny hole in the back of the battery pack. Poke something into it and it will press the red button. Sync as u normally would.
How long does it take to fully charge the batteries? Also is there an indicator to let you know they're charged?
Not long. The light changes colors when fully charged
Can I charge the the batteries alone? (without placing the whole wiimote on the charger)
No you need the remotes
is the wrist strap a problem while charging?
Barely!! If you pull the wrist strap under the controller as if it were a tail coming from the front, it works just fine :)
What color indicates that the remotes are fully charged?
They turn blue like shown, whn the batter is being charged the lights are red.
Does this work with any and all wii controllers? How?
i bought it for my daughter for christmas, she just charges the hand held controllers says it works good for them.
Does this work with white Wii remotes?
i dont know i bought it for my son but it should
Does it work with control with silicon case??
No, you need to remove the sleeve to charge. But they batteries once charge do fit with the controller in the silicon sleeve
This is listed as a PS3 peripheral. I know they make a PC version too. Will this wheel work with my PC?
They only make one version. It will both work with a pc and a ps3.
is this better than the Logitech g27 spec for spec
Yes in every way other than price ;p
Has anybody been able to get this to work with the xbox1/360/ps4 ?
I apologize I don't have the link here at the moment. But Sony did confirm that the T500RS, T80, and soon to release T300 are compatible with both PS3 and PS4. The T300 and T80 have switches for PS3 and PS4 modes, as well as Share button for PS4. Even though it doesn't have the PS4 buttons, it is so far the only PS3 wheel that works with PS4.
Will this work with the Playstation 4 without any sort of adapters?
I don't a PS4 but it works fine with the PS3. It should work just fine.
could i use the warranty if i take this to america latina?
Course! But they haven't authorized partners there, so you must send it to US or Europe to fix. Anyway, the T500RS is the best for your pocket.
Will the T500RS work on the PlayStation 4?
A google search for this answer will be your friend.
How quickly does the wheel turn? Is there any resistance from the motors?
Hey bro, the new T500RS is very good, really strong and very quiet. You can trust!
is it better than t300rs ?
Much better than the T300

i have recently downloaded the classic game of mario golf on my wii. Do you know if this wii classic controller works with my wii mario golf 64?
I boug it for the new super mario bros game classic I downloaded works good same. So yes it will work for your game :)
how does this one works with monster hunter ?
It didn't work at all for me
Does anyone know if this will work with Smash bros for the wii U?
Yes, however sometimes when you jump you jump at an angle even you didn't position the control stick too
Does this work when playing games on the Wii Shop Channel?
Yep, it should work with classic games you download from the wii shop!
is it needed to play call of duty black ops
I dont know, look on the back of the case and see what you need
Does it work with wii u?
perfectly fine. :)
Does this controller work for normal wii
Yes it does.... the only thing is that you have to plug it into your wii remote... I was kind of hoping it would plug into the wii itself so I wouldn't have to worry about battery life though, ya know? All in all it is a good controller bud. Hope this helps....
how long is the cord
A little less than arm's length.
does this work well for zelda virtual console games
I have never had any problems with mine. Some Wii games won't let you use a controller, but on the ones that do it works as good as my Nintendo one.
dose it break easley
Funny this came up. The Classic Controller broke about 5 days ago. A wire broke down next to the connector which is plugged into the regular controller. Just threw it in the trash. I think we had it about 3 or 4 months.

Unfortunately I don't know. I did not download the game, I bought the disc. I don't think it uses steam though but I cant say that with certainty.
Is there a patch that will update my windows-8 Dell computer so Rise of Flight and Cliffs of Dover both work? Pops
I am not a computer expert, but there is no reason why you cannot do what you want. I have not flown Rise of Flight, but Cliffs of Dover with the Team Fusion patches is great. Google Team Fusion CoD to get the info on downloading and installing the patches. It is all free and the forum is very friendly and helpful.
It just goes repeatedly through first time set up. I'm guessing that there is a patch out there that will solve my problem.
First be sure your PC is up to minimum specification. In fact that specification will only just run it on low settings. Windows 7 is the best OS. Look under your 'My Documents' folder for 1C Soft Club and see that there is an "il-2 sturmovik cliffs of dover" folder there, it is where your personal preferences are stored. If it still doesn't install properly you should register here (harmless, no side issues) and post a question/your problem, it is a very helpful and friendly community:- Register http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forum.php Post questions http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=63 Next install the following community patches (1C Maddox Games was closed down but the community is strong): 3.0, 3.01, 4.00, 4.312 You can get them here (no need to register, its open to the public): http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=10566 Be sure to read the install instructions especially about turning Steam updates OFF. It requires a little effort but is well worth it especially of you want to fly on line with hundreds of other virtual pilots. Good luck.
compatable with windows 7? 8.1? 10
Its only compatible with 8.1 if you download the 5 "mods" available on "TheAirTacticalAssaultGroup.com" web page. I had no luck what so ever until I downloaded these mods, now the game seems to be running smoother with little or now problems. There's also a "New Pilots" forum that gives you lots of good advice. Good Luck
what are system requirements?
Not off top of my head.... But google the game and scroll down, it should give you the requirements there
il2 cod-has force feedback? steam activation required with dvd version?

Is there a way to mute my mic? I'm thinking of matching this mixamp with Audio Technica's ATHADG1 which requires you to hold the mute button closed.

Can just one player play this game? Is it good for a six year old or is it for older children
This game play by 2P at a time with 1 screen will be split, good for children eisy to understand

I'm considering buying this for my boyfriend, who plays StarCraft: Heart of the Swarm. Do you think it would be good for him, or not make a difference
I play Star Craft: Heart of the Swarm with this mouse, and it is amazing. Very precise. I would highly recommend the Death Adder 2013.
I am looking for a long lasting gaming mice, with high precision, control and speed for FPS, which one should I get?
You have to get the a deathadder. If you have the money get the chroma edition.
I am looking for a long lasting gaming mice, with high precision, control and speed for FPS, which one should I get?
I'm not going to offer too much detail here since you can read all of the specs and the reviews, but I have been extremely impressed with this mouse. I use it on Linux and it's still highly configurable there with only third-party software controlling it! If you're using this on Windows or Mac then the software is extremely configurable, allowing you to write settings that get stored into the mouse itself (there is a small bit of writable memory where they store it), and even create multiple profiles that you can easily switch between. For example, you can configure a profile for regular desktop use that isn't too sensitive, another profile that is much more sensitive for FPS gaming, and so on. I have had this mouse for a year and it still looks and functions like the day I bought it. I haven't tried a bunch of other gaming mice but I have tried this one and I'm a huge fan.
Will this mouse work with MACs?
Yes! Mac OS X 10.6-10.9 should work just fine according to the tech specs on Razer's website - a driver update or two may be required for full functionality.
What is the difference with the black edition?
The original deathadder (blue glowing scroll wheel) but the black editions is just about the same thing (just with no glowing). The old versions use actual drivers. the new 2013 version requires the use of the synapse 2.0 program. You need to create an account and it attempts to connect to the internet. you can disable the auto-connect to internet feature.
We cannot get our new remote to sync. We have put in fresh batteries and pressed the red button, but it will not sync like our other Nintendo remotes
We had a similar problem with a non-Nintendo brand remote. You have to open the flap on the front of the wii, press the red button on the wii, release it and then press the button inside the remote. It should start flashing and then light up the as your secondary remote. If your master remote loses it's mind, do the same thing -- press the red button on the wii unit, release it and then press the button inside the remote.
Does this work with a wii U?
Yes
is this with motion plus
No
Will this work with Motion Plus if I plug that into it? I've got the motion plus adapter, but I need to replace one of my remotes.
No
is this a first party Nintendo remote?
No this is an aftermarket unit. It vibrates a lot and does not work well with the rechargeable battery
It is an official Nintendo wii remote?
No it's not. But it works great with our Wii.
Does this come with a wrist strap?
No, the wrist strap was not included.
Does it fit in the Mario Kart steering wheel?
Yes perfect fit
does this have the nunchuck with it?
no it does not
can you use a rechargable docking station with this remote?
Yes
Is the Mixamp the 2011 ed. (pictured) or 2013 w the eq presets (as described in item) ?

is the mix amp compatible with xbox one
Yes it is, but you have to buy the xbox adapter for the xbox one controller.
Will this mix-amp also work with 1st generation a-40 headset?
Yes
does it come with all the wires an stuff?
Yes comes with everything but you need to have an elite xbox 360 or you have to have an adapter for the plug in the back. I would suggest getting the a40 or 50s though. Much better.
Compatible with Playstation 4??
Yep. It works with everything!
Is the headset over-the-ear or on-the-ear?
On top of your eae
can i use this headset with my ps4 and pc?
Works with ps3 ps4 pc xbox 360 and xbox one. Check the website for more information :)
Are the wires very long
yes and no the complete unit reaches over 10-12 feet but the control until goes 1/2 way but you can easily extend the usb that needs to connect to the console
Does it work with the PlayStation 4
As far as I know it should. Check the astro website though.
Is the mixamp compatible with PC ?
Yes it is, but it will need to be plugged into both a USB port and your headphone and microphone jacks.

Yes comes with everything but you need to have an elite xbox 360 or you have to have an adapter for the plug in the back. I would suggest getting the a40 or 50s though. Much better.
Compatible with Playstation 4??
Yep. It works with everything!
Is the headset over-the-ear or on-the-ear?
On top of your eae
can i use this headset with my ps4 and pc?
Works with ps3 ps4 pc xbox 360 and xbox one. Check the website for more information :)
Are the wires very long
yes and no the complete unit reaches over 10-12 feet but the control until goes 1/2 way but you can easily extend the usb that needs to connect to the console
Does it work with the PlayStation 4
As far as I know it should. Check the astro website though.
Is the mixamp compatible with PC ?
Yes it is, but it will need to be plugged into both a USB port and your headphone and microphone jacks.
Is the Mixamp the 2011 ed. (pictured) or 2013 w the eq presets (as described in item) ?
I got the newer one with my order so 2013
is the mix amp compatible with xbox one
Yes it is, but you have to buy the xbox adapter for the xbox one controller.
Will this mix-amp also work with 1st generation a-40 headset?
Yes

Does this work with the XBone?
They sure do. You need to buy the chat adapter though. This one here: http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=pd_sim_vg_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=06H2ZR9Z02A1EVARQTFN That's only if you want it to work with chat though. It does work perfectly fine without it, you can just use the kinect for chat if you want to.
Does the A40 work with Xbox One?
Yes, and you can hook it up to multiple systems at once. I have mine connected to my PS4, desktop, and phone.
So if i were to buy these Astros, What EXACTLY would i need to buy extra to work with my Xbox One?
in your case this isnt the headset you should buy, instead of searching "A40 + MixAmp" search: "A40+ M80" m80 is the adapter for x1 controller. thats all i know :/
Can you have at fairly loud volume without disturbing someone nearby? How much "bleed?" I'm used to noise isolation earbuds.
Like all headsets there is some bleed if you have it loud enough. However the ear pieces themselves are very dense, so from personal experience, there is very little bleed compared to other headsets. I have not had a single complaint towards that issue, something i pride myself on because I hate hearing someone else's music.
Will the ASTRO A40 PC version sold on the Astro website work on the Xbox One using the MixAmp Pro?
Hi Chris. Yes, but more hardware is required. There is a special adapter/patch-cable that is needed for your controller. I'm not sure why they list these headphones as PC/Xbox/Sony. I have only seen the A40's come in ONE box. There might be a slightly more expensive set that includes the additional part you need. Here is a Youtube link if Amazon allows them- https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=astro+a40+on+xbox+one
Does it come with a chat cable for Xbox 360
It gives/comes with instructions for how to use it with each system, including the 360. I don't believe that you need anything else for any system but the xbox1
are the cables 3 pole or 4 pole? what's the difference?
The cable is 5 and 4 pole. The purposes of the extra poles isn't clear with the Astros, I've never been able to find the reasoning. The 5 pole connector plugs into the headset, and the 4 pole plugs into the mix amp.
Would this work for the PS4?
Absolutely, the mix amp pro that comes with it has multiple inputs, you would go straight out of the ps4 optical output into the mix amp pro and the mix amp would send the signal to the headphones, crisp and clear.
Are these capable of using USB for a PC hookup or are they the green/pink cables?
You can use a multitude of different connections. I myself am using my optical port.
Does this really weigh 2.2 pounds? I ordered these and I might cancel my order....
The headset itself doesn't weigh that much. The entire package comes in a fancy box with the amplifier (for lack of a better term) and a bunch of cables.
Does this work with the XBone?
They sure do. You need to buy the chat adapter though.

Does this come with the DLC?
The DLC must be bought in the PSN store.
Does this require an internet connection to play? (not update/install)
No, it doesn't. Only if you want the online features like the PvP and co-op you will need a internet connection.
This version includes Korean subtitles?
I don't think so
can i play this game in spanish?.. or even subtitles in spanish?
The game only has English audio and subtitles (or Japanese if you purchase the Japanese version. There is a multilingual (Spanish) Prepare to Die version of Dark Souls for PC though, if you don't mind buying the game for and playing on a PC. This PS3 version, however, is limited to only English audio and subtitles.
this game comes with case, manual and artwork?
It even comes in the wrapping. I got mine brand new. No problems! It came with everything. No scratches or anything. I recommend it. Its cheaper here than gamestop
will this work in europe? since i'm an european
To my knowledge, Sony does not region-lock games. I bought this from Canada and live in the States. Here is Wikipedia's answer: "All PlayStation 3 games except for one are region free.[4][5] Even though publishers could choose to region-lock specific games based on a mechanism that allows for the game to query the model of the PS3, none did so during the first six years after the launch of PS3.[6] The first game to be region-locked on PS3 is Persona 4 Arena..." So you should be fine. Enjoy!
Someone would tell me if this game is in Spanish or with subtitles in Spanish thanks?
It's in British English for all versions. I think you can get the Spanish localization which will have Spanish subtitles. I am not positive though, sorry.
What happens if your batteries die, or perhaps you remove the battery pack (by mistake of course). Will this trick work to render a pause?
I have known every game I play that when the batteries die the game does not pause. Which, in Dark Souls case, is very inconvenient.
With Strategy Guide????
No. But I suggest looking up wikigameguides on youtube. And wildpie101 for walkthrough help.
Is this game worth getting if you don't have online? I've really wanted to play it, but I don't want to feel like I've been "shortchanged".
Yes
Is this Free region game, so i can start it on my PAL xbox ?
I'm not entirely sure, but I have never heard of this game being region locked before. I would assume it is a free region game, so I say it should be safe to play.
Can this game be played off line?
Absolutely. It starts up in offline mode when there isnt a psn or xbl gold connection. Very little is lost in terms of functionality; it's a full-function game online and off.
The Game Has Spanish Language
mmm no entiendo si viene en espaol ? disculpen mi estupides

Yes, you can although the controls are a little different
If I buy the downloadable version of this .. does it automagically appear in my origin account?

i need the reciever for play in pc?
I just bought the Wifi Controller for Windows directly from Amazon and it does come WITH the USB transceiver for the PC. Buy it directly from Amazon if you want the transceiver with it.
how does it recharge?
It does not come standard with a rechargeable battery. You need either 2xAA batteries (which can be rechargeables if you want-I use eneloops myself) or the Microsoft rechargeable battery pack and the play/charge cable.
Does not work on my xbox 360 250gb slim: I want to know is anyone else having this problem?
Vince, If you haven't figured it out yet, you have to pair the controller with your Xbox 360. On the top edge of the controller, between the shoulder buttons, there is a small button with three ))) coming off it. Hold it down until the ring of LED's blink around the controller's guide button, then press the corresponding ))) button on the console (round on the original and Elite models, and a small rectangle right up against the front USB ports cover) so that it also has it's LED ring blinking around the power button. The blinking means they're trying to discover eachother. This works for me, hope it does for you too!
will it work on windows 8
Yep! I have windows 8 and it works great!
does it work with a mac
yes and no. They recommend buying the wired one and downloading this driver to make it work. http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver then buying an app that allows you to map the buttons. I use Joystick Mapper. But I found that a lot of games on steam that says controller support for windows, I had a hard time getting it to work for mac. A lot of trying to figure out what the buttons are, then mapping them.
Does it work well with the XBOX 360?
As it is an XBox 360 controller, it works fine. :)
do i need to own an xbox if i only want to use this to play games on my pc (does it require some sort of set up with an xbox)??
No, You dont need xbox360 itself. All you need is drivers which comes along with it just install it and you are good to go with most of the PC gaming !! the name itself might be cofusing as controller shape and style is same as native xbox360 controller but it has nothing to do with xbox360 box, yes you can use it on your xbox360 i guess !!! but if wish to use it for PC games, just installed the drivers and wireless USB, put some batteries and you are good to go!!
Does this work with emulators like ZSNES, ePSXe, and such?
It should since it acts as a native DirectInput device. I know it works in PCSX2.
This product comes with the Wireless Gaming Receiver Xbox? este producto viene con el Receptor de juegos inal&aacute;mbrico Xbox 360?
Yes, it includes the receiver also.
In the "i need the receiver for play in pc?" question, somebody stated that it no longer comes with a receiver. Is this still the case?
The one sold by Amazon does. The one sold by GPStock does not. Read my review it explains everything in detail.
How much Dorito dust will this hold until it is non-functional?
The more Dorito dust you cake onto this thing, especially around the analog sticks, the better you will become at Call of Duty. Also you should rinse it off with room temperature, flat Mountain Dew, but only the Gamer Fuel variety.
How long is the cord?
The official length, according to Microsoft, is 9 feet. See: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/accessories/controllers/xbox360controller But mine is actually 10 feet, but that include the USB break-away dongle that is on the end. The dongle itself adds 1 foot.
does it work with steam games?
It does NOT work or work well with DirectInput (older, legacy, pre-2006) games, only works with XInput games. Before 2006, all PC games used DirectInput API standard for game controllers. Then in 2005, Microsoft implemented the XInput API for Xbox 360, and Windows had to follow and adopted the new Xbox 360 standard. However, the transition process for Windows has been long and gradual: some Windows games from 2013 still used DirectInput, (e.g., BioShock Infinite.) The Xbox 360 controllers do NOT have built-in functionality to work with games that use DirectInput. Sometimes the controllers may work but poorly: the controls are erratic, only partially functional, and/or either too sensitive or insensitive. I found out about the DirectInput vs. XInput problem only after I had tried to use an Xbox 360 Controller to play BioWare's Jade Empire: Special Edition, which was released in 2007 on the PC. Jade Empire used DirectInput. The controller worked only partially: the left joystick (that controls movement) was moving by itself so my game character could not stand still; the right joystick (that controls camera view) and D-pad (for abilities) were non-functional. I went online to look for solutions, and learned about the different DirectInput and XInput API standards. That was when I found a long list of PC games, mostly older titles, that do NOT work or work well with the Xbox 360 controller. The solutions I found were either very technical and difficult to implement, and/or was an additional cost, (e.g., buying a gamepad emulation or profiler app, which usually costs around $10; none of the free ones work well -- I tried;) and/or was inconvenient to use, (e.g., every time I reloaded Jade Empire, I had to unplug and replug in the controller connection for a gamepad profiler to continue to work.) They are just hassles. The problem with Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windows, which none of the other reviewers/fanboys has even bothered to mention, is that it does NOT have a built-in function to work with DirectInput. It may work, but it certainly does not work well or perfectly. The Logitech F310, for example, has a physical switch behind between "D" (DirectInput) and "X" (XInput) methods. The switch should stay on "X" most of the time. However, if you ever run into a DirectInput game, you just switch over to "D". The Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller does NOT have that switch. Microsoft wants developers and users to conform: everyone should stop using DirectInput and adopt XInput, so Microsoft would tell you to "just don't play that game" instead of giving users a real solution. (That's that answer other people got when they called Microsoft to try to get a solution for the DirectInput problem.) If you know you will definitely NEVER touch an old, pre-2006 game that works better with a gamepad or run into one of the odd new games that still uses the old API standard, then this controller may work for you. However, if you do run into a game that uses DirectInput, it will be a lot of frustration and hassle.
Although this controller is meant for the pc, can it still be used for the console as well?
Yes actually. My friend had his xbox 360 and one controller and I put in mine and worked perfectly.
Do I need to calibrate or download programs and are the programs included?
No, drivers were instantly downloaded when I plugged the device in, and once automatically configured, the device worked perfectly with all programs.
Hi, those any one know if it will work with Mac computer?
I can confirm it works with OSX 10.9 using the "tattiebogle" drivers. Feels just as responsive as when playing on the 360.
Does this work with Windows 8?
Worked fine with Windows 8 & 8.1. Didn't ask for any drivers
Does this controller work for Minecraft. Kids love it on the 360 but have dificulty with the keyboard on the computer
No, the PC version of Minecraft does NOT support controllers like this, however there are mods available that add support. Do a Google search with the following terms to quickly find info "Xbox Controller PC site:minecraftforum.net" That is the official Minecraft forum, so it is trustworthy and heavily patrolled for malicious content. Be sure to read some of the comments before downloading something, though, just to be safe.
Has anyone used this with old-school console emulators, and if so, does it feel okay playing older games?
I use is for all my games from the original nintendo to playstation 2 and I think it is great
Can I use this controller in the place of a mouse and keyboard on SIM type games?
I do not believe so, unless the game has controller support, the analog sticks do not take the place or act as a mouse in any situation. This could vary widely on the game, but in most cases this answer will be no.
if i purchase the digital code, do i log in on amazon with my email or the one for the playstation
If you do this, you're gonna receive the code on your email, from Amazon. Then, you just have to write the code on PS.
will this work in India?
im from Guatemala but my account its from US, so the thing is that your account must be created in US Region to this to work.
i'm from Portugal , and i have a portuguese psn account , if i buy it ,will it work for me?
The ps plus you buy from amazon only work you if you're a user of united states, mexico and canada, and also if you think an American Profile, will ask for a credit card in the American region, you will not serve use your card charging credit of portugal. I've tried it in my country and 17 dollars were thrown away, if someone wants I can change for the $ 10 ps gift card
I&acute;m from Vzla, to activate the code in my ps4 I will need an american credit card code to use it?My PSN account is american, I have not US credit card
Not, you dont need an american credit card. Buy it and actvate it.

Hmmm I think you do, but also I think that they don't verify that in this kind of purchases (digital ones)
I am trying to ender a psn card to my account but it is saying that it is no longer valid but i just bought the card 20 mins ago what could be prob?
Just so I'm clear, you bought a $20 PSN code on Amazon but when you try to redeem it on the PSN store it says that it is no longer valid. Try going to the online PSN store here: https://store.sonyentertainmentnetwork.com/#!/en-us/home/games , after signing it with you PSN ID click on your account name in the upper-right of the screen and go to redeem code. Try doing a copy/paste from the code Amazon gave you. You'll have to copy/paste the 3 parts separately, xxxx-xxxx-xxxx, the PSN store won't let you do all 12 characters at once. If that doesn't work try contacting Playstation Customer Support here: https://support.us.playstation.com/app/contact_options
when you put in the credit card is it taking off your credit card or your amazon credit
You can use your payment of choice to purchase this Gift Card. If you are unsure what your payment mode is I suggest checking your 1-Click Order settings to verify. All of my purchases of this where using my credit card, and never had a problem.
can i use this code to pay for ps plus without registering a credit card
Yes, you can.

No, tenes que crear una cuenta en estados unidos para poder usar la gift card ! Saludos desde Guatemala !
How do I get my code

if its an amazon gift card redeem it on your account. it will tell you that you need a credit card to set up one click payment when you go to buy the playstation card. once thats done when you go to pay it takes the funds from the money you redeemed on the gift card.
if i have a Mexico PSN acct . would there be a problem purchasing a USA PS Store card?
I think it would not work. Just add your credit card information to your Mexican PSN account and you should be fine.

I have 2 one year ps plus cards..I redeemed 1 back in nov. Anyone know if I can go ahead and redeem the 2nd so I don't forget about it?
I had about one month left on my subscription when I bought another year subscription - and it just added that time on, so you should be able to do the same.
if i bought my PS4 from US, and i traveled to a different country, will i not be able to use this code?
of course u can. in this very moment i am in Argentina and i have my PS4 whit me, and i playing BF4.
How do I receive the code? Will be via email or snail mail to my billing address? Cos the address belongs to my friend not mine.
You will receive an email with the link for the code and once you get it give it to the person you want and that's all to it. Very simple painless process. Great gift for a gamer as well.
what is the different between ps plus code and the code which included with the cd ??
If you buy a PS commonly they will give you 1 or 3 free months, it depends on the promotion, it is included on the bundle, but it will expire then you will not be able to play some games, this code will give you a full year, you can use it when your subscription expire.
When does the year starts running? When I buy the card or when I redeem the code on the PS4?
When you redeem the code on the PS4
hello, a question if I buy it now comes to me today by email the code ?
Yes
I am located in Egypt. I tried to purchase the membership on the PS4 but Egypt isn't listed in the country list. Is it gonna work if I purchase this?

cable included?
Yes.
does it come with cable and will work on PC/ Windows 7 ?
Aye to both.
I just installed it today and it seems to be fully working, but says it is the demo. Did I get robbed or is this a developer oversight? Anyone else's PC version say it's the demo?
Did you install Steam? To register Rocksmith program you will need to install steam. Installation of steam should have been included on Rocksmith.
My computer has an EVGA 512-A8-N403-LR GeForce 6200 512MB 64-Bit GDDR2 AGP 8X Video Card, is this compatible with the program?
Yes it should work fine with those specs.
does the cable work with Rocksmith 2014 ?
yes! If you already own Rocksmith you can get an upgrade to Rocksmith 2014 Edition - "No Cable Included" Version Does NOT include the required Rocksmith Real Tone Cable. Intended for players that already have the cable. Platforms: Xbox 360, PlayStation3 system, PC/Mac (Download only) Price: $59.99 at Rocksmiths website.
Does this or any versions come with a guitar?
Supply your own.
Is this able to be used with a Mac?
No, this first edition is only for pc. If you want to use on a mac then you have to get rocksmith 2014 edition, that one is mac or pc. I will tell you this make sure your mac and or pc meants games requirements. I have both editions and my mac doesnt meet requirements. I had to upgrade a pc. Hope that helps. I love both editions.
Does the game work on windows 8?
Yes. I'm currently using Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014 on Windows 8.
What the diference this for 2014 edition?
New song list and some tweaks to the game play. For some the changes will be superficial, but for some they are significant (like the ability to set the difficulty level). see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocksmith_2014
The description says it comes with the cable, but does it? I already got burned by another seller where the description said it came with the cable.
I got the cable. Everything was included with my purchase.
Does this include the real tone cable?
Not sure! I gave it to my son for a christmas gift. He was able to use it right away without having to go purchase cables or anything. They love it.
so for country music on an aucoustic guitar, what is a good one to get that plugs in?
Yamaha has an amazing 3/4 size acoustic that plugs in.
Does it support a left hand string guitar
Yes it does!!
Can two people play this at the same time with two different guitars?
As long as you buy a second cord for the guitar, you should be able to play with two people and two separate guitars.
this game include the cable? D:
yes
Is this for a 13 year old beginner?
All ages can play this game. When in game play the game will adjust it's difficulty automatically to a level comfortable enough for the player.
does the cable works fine in rocksmith 2014 ?
Yes
Does this game have to be connected to the internet to play it ?
I think you can use it with or without internet
Can you use a hollow body electric/ electric acoustic?
Any guitar, or bass, that will plug in can be used.
Does this work with the 3DS XL or just the 3DS?
Just the 3DS, not the 3DSXL.
Does it come with just the base or the Base+Battery? , Battery by itself is 20$ here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004...
It comes with the base and battery.
is it compatible for dual voltage? Im staying for a few months in a country that only uses 220 voltage +/- 10%
I would assume so, as it is simply a bigger battery. Make sure you use the correct adapter for charging.
Does it work for 3ds XL?
No just the 3DS
Is the base necisary? Or does the battery pak, once installed, just charge when the 3DS is plugged into the 3DS charger?
The base is just a convenience, it can charge through the normal charging port still. I have this and have very much enjoyed it, the only thing that is not perfect about this is that the 3DS says it has a low battery after the same amount of time as the normal battery would have. So it will say it has low battery, but still has around 60-70% left
Does it work with 2ds
No it's not the same arrangement as the 3DS so it won't fit
Can this be used for a DSi?
I highly doubt it. The size of the battery isn't the same, therefore it won't fit properly.
Does this have the base and the powerpak?
yes,it comes with Powerpak and base. Thanks,
Can you play with your 3DS while charging on the base?
You can play with the 3DS while charging. (For me, the only way to charge it at all is to leave it powered on.) I've done it a couple times. However, it would be a little weird if you're holding it because you would have to make sure that it stays charging and you don't move it a certain way to stop it from charging. It is possible to charge it, but for me it is a little weird when holding. However, instead of holding it, you could also leave it laying flat on the table, desk, where ever you placed it to charge. But yes, it is possible to play it while charging.
Does it come with back piece and charge base?
yup, it comes with both
Does this actually work for Nintendo 3DS? Because I brought this for a replacement charger because I lost my previous one.
Yes it does. My son has a 3DS and uses this one.
When you say it's good for travel does that mean it is a car charger? I don't need that.
More as a backup in a hotel, or to keep at grandmas house kind of thing, my grand children are always forgetting theirs so, there is one here now, and I will get one for the cottage too probably.
is it compatible with a Dsi XL i got in 2011- 2012? If not, where can i find one?
Yes, I think it works.
Does the charger burn and create smoke?
We've had this charger for about 3+\- months & have had no problems with it.
Is this original Nintendo or generic?
We use ours on the original
How long is the cord?
It's not anywhere near as long as the one that comes with the 3DS. This one is about two and a half feet shorter than the one that came with the 3DS.
How long is the actual chord?
think charger the cord wasn't the normal size that you get with a ds it was short you have to sit really close to the outlet
can a 11 year old play it?
Yes. It's great for all ages. They just have to make sure they're responsible enough to keep their sims alive.
Do you need another version of sims to play this game?
Yes
do you need to buy the sims 3 before this?
Yes. This just an add on
Dose it include the Babysitter job?
Yes
Dose it include the Babysitter job?
Yes
is it violent
No. One of the least violent expansion packs, imo. No new deaths, no violent actions that I can think of.
Will my Sims be able to granduate from high school?
Yes, and the schools and extracurriculars are specified towards your Sim's goals (ballet, military school, science club).
is it a cd?
Yes
it can work on any mac right
Yes. They used to be separate games, but now they all work on both platforms
can this game work on windows 8 ???
SIM's 3 works on WIN 7..... I have no idea it working on WIN 8..... sorry :)

does it work for the wii u
Yes it does. Just load up the virtual Wii menu, and it will show up in the "Launch Disc Software" area.
Does it work for a wii mini?
It looks like it takes the same games.. It should be able to.. My niece has a wii u and my wii resorts game works just fine :)
What is the difference between the edition of "software only" and "with wii motion plus" ?
The wii motion plus has the adapter. If you have newer or 3rd party controllers that already have it, then you don't need the +. If you don't, then get some after market controllers that do, since the + adapter sticks out of the controller.
is Wii motion required?
Yes. One motion plus for each controller.

Is this a game for people who just want alot of running in a Sonic game or is there alot of stopping and story and destroying bots?
Mostly running. Not nearly as much stopping as some of the other recent (bad)games. All in all they pretty much got it right here and it pretty much runs smoothly the entire game. Not much story (nothing like sonic adventure) and not so many annoying enemies. A great game!
Does this game have multiplayer mode
Hi Adam, NO, this game is for only 1 player.
Can we use it in Spain?
..If you have a ps3..I don't see why not
Playing the classic games, up to what title can you play? Does it include Sonic &amp; Knuckles?
Actually this is kind of like a compilation of a few levels from all generations of Sonic games, though it includes classic Sonic the hedgehog as an unlockable. If you are looking for classics id recommend Sonic Genesis Collection on PS3 I dont hace it yet but I've read it has all of the genisis classics including Sonic and Knuckles.
Can you use remote play with the playstation vita slim
Yes
Can you play the game on PS4?
only on ps3/ 360

Will this game work with Playstation 4?
PS4 is not backwards-compatible with PS3 disc-based games. They are planning to offer bunch of PS3 titles streaming, however, through Playstation Now.

It connects via mini usb cable (what ti 84 uses), and i have used it for gameboy/snes emulators successfully.

Is White 2 and Black 2 the same game? I'm confused because they have the exact same number of reviews and I don't know which to get my daughter.
Yes and no. They're different versions of the same exact game. They each have some minor, version exclusive content that the other game does not. This is to encourage player interaction and sharing. But you are not missing out on anything if you get one version and not the other.
Do you have to have played the first version to play Black and White 2?
The story is not wholly dependent upon the story of Black/White version. There are a handful of things that may make more sense, but nothing particularly necessary to enjoying the game.
can this game work on 3ds XL UK version ?
The 3DS can play DS games with no issue.
Is Spanish languages included?
We got the black version and no Spanish
is this handheld
Yes
I wasn't able to play the first Pokemon B&amp;W due to Nintendo cutting the wifi access, will this game spoil the experience of the first game?
No it will not because of the multiple changes
This is the U.S. version of pok&egrave;mon right? Does it matter?
Please elaborate your question. Matter how so? I've been playing the US versions for over a decade with no problem
Can this be played on a ds lite?
Yes
Can this work on a DSI.
Yes, that what my grandchild has.

Yes, all DS games are also playable on the 3DS.

Some one earlier has asked if we can use the pro controller but im wondering for single player, could we use anything else except the gamepad?
You can use the Gamepad, Pro Controller and even the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combo.
can two people play this game?
For the main "Story" part of the game, it is a single player. That part is NOT co-op. There are Missions and Bingo Battle that are two player. My husband and I are addicted to playing the Missions which are co-op and very fun.
Does this work with the pro controller?
It is compatible with it however I have not personally used it with one (because it is easier to point and aim with a wiimote, I think).
Why is this game such a ridiculous price? $92.00? Does it put your kids to bed and drive them to school the following morning? A bit steep otherwise.
Game is out of print
Can you use the GameCube controller with this game?
unlikely. Originally Nintendo said that Gamecube controller would be supported by anything that uses a pro controller, but they updated later that it would only be supported with Smash. They might change their mind again, but currently the answer is no.
Should I have played other Pikmin games before playing Pikmin 3?
Honestly it does not make a difference. There are a few references to one and 2 that you might not 'get', but I don't think you'll miss anything major. Many mechanics are new or changed and everything you'll need to know is explained in game (or left as a puzzle for you to solve, obviously).
My 5 year old loves the Pikmin mini game in Nintendoland do you think Pikmin 3 would be too advanced for her?
It very well could be. The controls for the game aren't very complicated, but the premise of the game can be. I would recommend Pikmin for kids in the 7-12 range due to the problem solving aspects as well as the impending frustration from some of the tougher parts of the game. If she's a problem-solver and has good hand eye coordination, it might be worth a shot! Plus, you could always play it too and it is definitely a really fun game. I'm 28 and I love it.
anyone know why they're not producing this anymore? you'd think with WiiU sales up 100% a new wave of people are there to buy...
Nintendo doesn't like money
Why is this listed at $75?
It's because there is not a supply of them in the U.S. It's a very rare to find one new at a store anywhere.
Why is it so expensive?
It's a very rare game that's out of production

the old wii remote works with wii U?
Yes, my Wii Remote and nun-chuck works great on the Wii U and is one of the main alternative controlling options for most Wii U games.
Can you play Super Smash Bros. Brawl?
Yes you can. Wii U is backwards compatible and plays all Wii games. It is also compatible with all Wii controllers and accessories.
Can I use an SD card or another form of storage to make up for the 8GB?
I know this is an old question, but it's voted high, so for future reference, you can't use an SD card to store Wii U data, but you can easily use an external hard drive, or even a flash drive/memory stick for Wii U data storage.
If I downloaded games or other content from the Wii Shop Channel, is it possible to transfer them to Wii U?
Sorry for the late response. Yes indeed you can! All you need is a Wii console, at least one Wii Mote, and SD card and of course, a Wii U console. You can find videos of the process on You Tube. I plan on transfering downloaded games from my Wii to Wii U soon. Good luck!
Can the 8 GB version of the Wii U handle playing all games and the new Marvel Super Heroes? Why would you need more than 8 GB?
the "8gbs" is really just for stuff you download so unless you download all your games, it should not be a problem
exactly what comes with the console?
Console, controller, hdmi cord, power cable, sensor bar. No games.
i want this because i prefer the look of the white console. will the wii u operate w/o issue with only 8gb internally and a hd attacked via usb?
Same reason I bought it, the black ones also attract oil build up really easily. Anyways yes you can survive quite easily. I just have a USB 64gb flash drive hooked up but you can go as high as a terabyte portable HDD. Happy gaming &#128077;
Is the Wii U backwards compatible with Gamecube Games and the Wavebird Wireless Gamecube controller?
It is not backwards compatible with gamecube games, only Wii games. A GameCube game would probably break your Wii u. Most of the original wiis are GameCube backwards compatible with GameCube controller ports. The controller, not unless you have the GameCube controller adapter
Does it come with the gamepad?
Yes the game pad has a red case on it.
Is this an upgraded version of the Wii U that comes with Sylanders Swap Force Limited Edition or is it the same.
It's the wii only without the skylanders swap force bundle
the old wii remote works with wii U?

Does the Nintendo 3DS XL play 3DS games? i know it play DS games i'm sure about 3DS games please let me know thanks Tim
It does. It is the same thing as a 3DS but bigger. That's the only main difference. Also you can play with the depth of the 3D effect to adjust it to whatever you like it to be.
Does this one come with a memory card included?
All the 3ds should come with an sd memory card.
what is the firmware version of this product? or what year is written on the copyright?
Firmware Version - If you are talking about the current firmware update for the 3DS family, as of 10/19/2014 it's 9.0.0-20 U for people in the Americas region. If you are buying a 3DS it may not be up to date. Copyright - should be 2012-2014 (soon to be 2015!)
Does this one come with AR Cards included?
Yes, my purchase had come with the cards.
do we can play a ds games in a ds3?
Yes or 2ds
can we play gameboy advance games on the 3ds and 3ds xl?
No, the feature in the bottom of the system was taken away as the DSi was Relased, and wasn't added onto the 3DS
does the charger support 220v ?
No.
Is the "virtual console" or eShop available on this version of the 3DS? I wanna play and download the original Gameboy classics
I believe the eShop is part of the 3DS. I have a different color, but it still has the application that lets me go into the eShop.
how long takes to ship it???
The mail has already been picked up at the house today. There's still an hour before the post office closes, I am pretty available right now so I can drop it off within that timeframe if you order now and your order does not go into a pending state(I have no control over pending states, usually it's waiting for credit card verification or things like that). However at this point it is not likely to get there by Christmas anyway, the post office has been moving slowly and I do not ship via overnight shipping methods. If you live within a state of Georgia there is a better chance it may get there before Christmas. Anyhow, that is the best I can do for you and I hope that answers your question. I need at least 30 minutes to pack it up and get there and it's 4pm here right now. Post office closes at 5.
My daughter who is 9 going on 10 wants a 3ds. Is it suitable for her age? also will i have to purchase additional cartridges or something?
This is a suitable gift for children. It has parental controls so you can limit what she does, such as browsing the Internet. 3ds Internet has Safe Browsing enabled. You can buy games online, or buy the cartridges. I would suggest buying games online, so your child doesn't accidentally lose or damage their game. The cartridges are a bit small and easy to lose track of if not taken care of. Also if you lose your stylus, you can order new ones for cheap. Those are also easy to lose.
How is this compared to The Last of Us, can you give me a short description of what I can expect from the gameplay? Guns? 1st or 3rd person shooting?
This game is basically completely different than The Last of Us. Beyond Two Souls was made by the same company who made Heavy Rain. It's heavily story based and you follow a plot through cut scenes and situations where you can decide how to interact with the environment. You do not fight monsters or enemies except in scripted fight scenes where you select the right buttons to use. You don't have weapons either. This isn't a shooter game its an interactive drama action-adventure video game also called a movie game. Basically you play a movie.
I found that this can play in 3D has anyone Played it in 3D yet.
Someday hopefully. But on ps3 I think it may only be 720p 3D. ps4 may be even better 1080p 3D. So how does it look in 3D?
Are there actually puzzles in the game - and are they good?
The term "puzzle" for this game I think is used a bit loosely. There are questions you will develope while playing the game because something seems amiss or just not entirely clear, but are answered as you progress. When they say "puzzle" it's probably more along the lines of "how do I want to define my character?". The choices you make during the game, whether verbally or physically, will alter the story and relationships later on. Example: a scene where people are mean/abusive to you. You can choose to seek revenge or let it go. I'm not sure if you remember these, but there were "choose your own adventure" storybooks. You were given a scenario and each choice you made had a different outcome.
Please have sub titles in Spanish?
Yes
The item isn't the special edition. The special edition is a steel box version. am i wrong?
Hi Shelly, thats right, this isnt the special edition, its the standard one. And yes, special edition has steel box...

Please, is this game translated to spanish?
No. The audio is in English and french, and the subs also. The spanish version is only sell in Spain.
I just received this game today and found out there is no game manual. Am I the only one who is missing it?
I did not have one in mine either but I don't really see the need for it. I never look at them anyways.
Quien me dice si este producto exactamente viene en espa&ntilde;ol latino lo quiero comprar ya que esta a un precio absecible quien me dice gracias
No mi amigo, el que venden en Estados Unidos y Europa solo viene en voces y subtitulos en ingles y frances, el que viene en espaol latino es el especfico para latinoamerica, una sea que he visto (tengo las dos versiones) es que el que est en ingles dice en la caratula "only on Playstation", mientras que el espaol latino obviamente dice lo mismo pero en espaol.
Does this work with services such as Netflix, Hulu and WWE Network?
I use it for only Netflix and it works for that.
Does this work with the PS4? If not, is there a PS4 remote available?
No, it doesn't work with the PS4. This is the entry from the list of compatible accessories (link provided): PlayStation Media / Blu-ray Disc Remote Control - PS4 supports CEC (HDMI Direct Link) and can use your TV's Remote. http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-Peripherals-Support/List-of-Compatible-PS3-Accessories-for-PS4-Updated-2-7-2014/td-p/40831841
Could I possibly pair this with the bluetooth remote function on my media center computer (windows) as well as my ps3?
No. The unit will only work with the ps3 and some other sony products.
Hi is this able to control the in app Netflix volume?
Not sure. I wasn't aware that there was in app volume control for Netflix. I have programmed the control to my T.V., so I just adjust the volume on my T.V. as needed. The control has all of the buttons your PS3 control has and then some to do things such as slow motion or bookmarks, ect. in one touch of a button. However it does not have the joysticks but it does have the "R3" and "L3" buttons. It also can be programmed to your amp as well. You can also change the audio and subtitle settings at the touch of a button. I hope this helps.
I'm trying to use my ps3 remote control/blue ray remote and when I try using my ps3 to turn it on the ps3 button on top just blinks???
Mine always blinks 3 times the first time I turn it on. ..have you synced it to YOUR PS3 yet ?
does anyone know if it works with vudu app?
It should work with all apps on the PS3. If you are trying to use the app on a machine other than the PS3, than this controller will not work for it.
Does this work on ps4 consoles?
Unfortunately it does not.
will this remote control a regular sony blu ray player? a bpd-s5100 to be exact?
Don't think that it will. According to the manual, it's only able to operate the PS3, supported TVs and Sony-only AV amps.
Will this work on the Sony HT-XT1 sound bar?
Maybe it states it will only work with Sony equipment, I don't have the specific instructions with me though
Compatible with optima projector on the TV button ?
I would say most likely not. In the instructions you are supplied tv codes to program remote. There's a scan option to find the code for the but I highly doubt that'd work with a projector.
Does it work with cars 2 on ps3.
I'm sorry I cannot answer...kids do not have this game.
Does it works with ps4 ?
Yes, and navigator too.
Compatible with MotoGP 14? Is possible to use 2 together to play Split Screen?
Hey man, I dont know for that game. Actually I use the wheel for play little big planet karting and I use two. One for me and one for my daughter and works great. Sorry if i dont answer your exactly question.
Does it work with GTA 5 PS3?
Yes.
Need for speed most wanted
Compatible.
Can this be used with any racing games for ps3?
Yes
The wheel come with original box?
no
Does this work with Motorstorm Apocolypse?
Yes, very well.
I keep getting "reconnect your wheel" message when trying to use it for Little Big Planet Karting. It is frustrating. Any solution for that?
you may be to close to the camera... i had the same issue, also check the setting on the lens, wide or narrow view it will make a difference on how far you are sitting. hope this helps. have a happy easter
will it work on xbox one
no it is only xbox 360 compatible.
How many people can play on the console at once?
It is single player but if you posses xbox live you can play with friends
How many people can play on the console at once?
Just one. :(
do you need xbox live to play this?
You don't need Xbox Live.
do you need high speed internet
No
Will this game work with xbox 360 system link?
Yes I believe so.
Do you need kinect to play?
No
whats the difference from pc....pc download.....and pc instant wouldnt they all be instant?
PC is basically a case with the PC disc. PC download, well I've done GTA 4 on PC download on my powerful laptop and it took more than a week do download. You'll stand a better chance buying it other than PC, just graphic and smooth gameplay wise.
is need for speed popular
In my experience, I say yes, it is. No way its not. After around ten years of need for speed gaming, I'm into it now. Have you ever tried any NFS games? Because I think you might want to reconsider on this one. I've tried it before and the steering response is a little late and challenging. I'm just saying. However, the other ones Like Underground 1 % 2, Most Wanted (2005), Carbon, Undercover, Hot Pursuit (2010), World (Online), Rivals (2013) are better than this one. Give any of them a go. You'll like it.
Is this one region locked? My console is from Asia

good this game is in Spanish, and cd or code to download
I think to be on Spanish u have to downdo far is in English
Is this download only or the physical disk?
Disk
This game comes with multi idioms included spanish?
If you're asking about language settings in the game. They have a language pack that comes on the second disk (xbox 360 version). So you just have to download it and change the settings then.
The game comes in several languages?
The xbox 360 version comes with a two disks. The first disk is the game, the second disk is alternate langauges.
Is this two discs?
Yes, there are two discs. Disc 1 is the installation disc. Disc 2 is the "play" disc, meaning you have to have it in the X-Box while you are playing the game.
Is it safe to order a used one or better to buy a new one?
I've always bought new games but if I did buy a preowned game I would make sure they had a great review from them positive feed hope this helps
I have an 8 and 9 year old who has been begging for this game. As a parent I have many concerns about the content....can anyone on the forum recommend a game similar without the adult content? Thanks in advance!!
I would say no, I really didn't know how bad it was until I started playing it. The language and sexual references and actual sexual content, I feel make this game much worse than a rated R movie. The game itself and free play world are amazing, I wish you could edit the other stuff out.
is it fun?
Yes
I have two questions. 1: how much storage is required to play the game. 2: Would you get this for a person that is turning 11
8gb is required to play the game. I would get this for a 11yr old. My daughter is 13 and I just bought it for her. I think as long as the children who play this game knows right from wrong and is respectful, then it should be okay. I would buy the game from Xbox store instead of amazon. My daughters game only worked 1 day. Now I have to buy her another one. I could of returned it for an exchange of a new one but she threw away the box and label.
Is Assassin's Creed 4 a better choice than Grand Auto Theft V?
No because, there is less to do on Assassin's creed. It also has a smaller area than GTA V where as GTA V has a huge world with variety of gameplay. But this is just my opinion and I feel that kids and young teenagers should buy Assassin's creed due to GTA V having a lot of profanity in it. If GTA could tone that down then GTA V is for me a 100% fun time.
Why it is only 29$?
I don't know seems pretty cheap when I bought it I thought it was fake or something but I took a risk and everything seems pretty good works great runs great I've had no problems good game and good deal
Is this o.k. for asia region (vs u.s.a / canada
This is made for USA made consoles. So it probably wouldn't work for any other country.
Would you let a MATURE 13 year old boy play this game?
I would think of it this way. You should play it with your boy and explain things along the way. Just like would you let them watch Road warriors the movie by them selves or with you watching it with them.
Say i have borrowed the game from a friend and have already downloaded the 8 gb. Would i have to download it again if i bought it here??
No it just needs a disc to run the game.
Does this game come with any download codes? Or a multiplayer code?
Yes. It comes with both.
This game is multi language?
Yes
Can you play this game on a PS4? I am looking to buy a PS4 for my son but he wants Assassin's Creed 3 and it looks as if its only for PS3. Ty
At the moment, the PlayStation 4 will only play PS4 games. Unless Ubisoft Montreal decides to make a PS4 version of this game, which is unlikely being that they are currently working on the production of newer Assassin's Creed titles, this game will only be playable on the PlayStation 3.
If I buy this, will the case come in a regular clear case or will it be those ugly greatest hits red cases?
The one l bought came in a Clear Case not that Greatest Hits.
Does this game come with the greatest hits box (red) or the normal one?
Mine came in the actual box.
hello can be played on Spanish?
Si, it has subtitles both in English and Spanish
Does it come in spanish too?
NO.
assassins creed 3 trailer had connor riding a horse charging into battle while americans were retreating, is any of that footage in the game itself?
Yes
should i buy this game does it go along with the original story from ac1 ac2 etc will it affect the story line if i skip it and get ac black flag
Hate to break it to you but you won't find ezio or Altair in these games. There stories are done. But I would recommend you do not skip. Get this first than that so you will understand what's going on. However I would get brotherhood and revelations before this one so you know what's going on in 3
This game has subtitles in Spanish?
Unfortunately, it doesn't...just English as default language.
does the xp500 transmitter work with the xp510 headset
As they are two different model numbers, I doubt it
can the mic be connected to the PC in any way? if so what is the quality?
Yes. very good quality sound
Does it interfere with wi-fi?
It does not interfere with wifi, wifi interferes withe the rf signal from the box to the headset.
Does this have a jack to plug your own music into?? Thanks..
sort of i guess, depends on what you are using it for. It has the ability to take 2 different sound sources. One from the wireless adapter it comes with and then it can also connect via bluetooth or the small 2.5mm jack used by xbox controllers. Though honestly i would avoid this as mine has broken so many time from just wearing them, the bluetooth has always sounded like crap (the one you use for its mic and voice chat) and always had the main sound cutting in and out while right next to the base station.
is this for just the head set or dose everthing come with it
It come wit everything. It is good for the price (:
Can it work with pc?
I haven't tried...but if your PC has the correct audible out jack it should, no problem.
Will this work with Win 7??
Yes, it works awesomely and on my 64bit system to boot! And the better the graphics card, the better and more graphics you will be allowed to view in game, i.e. you can download a special expansion graphics pack that makes things nearly real life. So, get it, and enjoy!
Do you need steam to play?
It actually uses Origin instead of Steam. The Origin client and an origin account are required to play though.
It said in the fine print that this would work with Win XP, Vista, and Win7,.... even the instructions with the disks had instructions for use with XP
It should, however if your system is using xp and you are having problems running the game, the problems are more likely to be hardware related. Too little ram or not enough power in you video card. This game is intensive on older systems.
Will it run on Windows 8.1?
i believe so, i ran it on 7, but have heard that all the 8 & 8.1 versions can run in an emulator mode for older versions if you need...it may run fine as is. have fun, it was a good game.
Is this the Hunters Edition like the image shows or just the normal Crysis 3 DvD?
Apparently you get the bow earlier in the game and a few other features, which didn't mean a lot, honestly I only bought the Hunter's edition because it was pretty much the same price as the regular edition, but if there is a cheaper version of the original $10 or so cheaper, I would say that is a batter choice.
Do family settings exist for the PC version to eliminate the bad language?
Not that I'm aware of. The other consideration is the violence. There isn't tons of gore, but the nature in which you eliminate enemies can be pretty graphic and intense depending on the maturity level/age of the player.
will it work with windows 8.1 ?
im using win 7
Does it work with windows 8?
Yes
can you play crisis on line against other players
Yes. Crysis 3 has a public multiplayer option available and all platforms.
Can I play this game with an Xbox controller?
Yes, if you have a USB enabled XBOX(360/1) Controller. The game supports Game Controllers(USB Paddles,Console Controllers) with 360 Controls built in. - Although your accuracy will be much lower than mouse controls due to not having aim-assist in the PC Version.
does it have subtitules in spanish?
No
does it have subtitules in spanish?
Yes
Thinking of buying this used, but what is the Downloadable Content needed to play this game? Is it worth buying without dl content?
Yes. All DLCs are just extra maps and game modes for multiplayer and has no effect on the gameplay itself
is there corvettes?
yes they do and here is a website that you can check out all the car that you can get.................... http://www.ign.com/wikis/forza-horizon/Vehicle_List
Does this work with the Xbox 360 wireless speed wheel?
Yes
Can we tune and upgrade cars like on the track based forza versions?
Upon searching game facts for Forza Horizon, we found that you can upgrade cars but cannot tune cars. Thank you kindly and have a great day.
does this game have free roam?
Yes
If I order this today, when will I get it?
This information is estimated as it would also be based on the time your order is placed Order Date: March 5, 2015 Expected Ship Date: Mar 6, 2015 to Mar 9, 2015 Estimated Delivery: Mar 11, 2015 to Mar 16, 2015 Shipping Service: Standard Thank you kindly and have a great day
Does Forza horizon for the xbox360 have free roam?
Yes
Does this have 2 player offline, like race against your friend on the same console?
No, sadly the horizon series doesn't have this, only forza 3,4 & 5.
Will the forza horizon 2 play in a 4 GB xbox360 ?
Yes
does it work without kinnect?
Yes
Is this better than the second one on Xbox 360?
No the second game has better graphics and better cars.
is this the physical game? or just the serial... Standar Version
It is the actual physical box copy of the game
Is this still available in stores? Or is it out of stock and has been replaced by Warlords of Draenor?
Do not buy this. It comes with the World of Warcraft Standard Edition now: http://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-PC-Mac/dp/B00FRESQYG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1417828535&sr=8-5&keywords=world+of+warcraft "Includes Expansion Packs: The Burnings Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, and Mists of Pandaria"
Do you get 30 days access to the game with this expansion?
No, only with starter pack
Will this work on Windows 8?
Ofcourse :)
I buy the game and send the email right through licensing is that possible?
I am sorry I do not understand your question. You need the game mailed to you to play it. It's not like some software that you can use a code to play.
does the game only last for 30 days and then you have to pay like 10$ dollers every month or is it permanent?
Basically, this just unlocks additional game play for the WoW series, you'll still need the starter pack and pay for gameplay either with a credit card attached to your battle.net account or with game cards purchased at a store. It is $30 every two months for gameplay access (so basically $15 per month to play).
I can buy the product and send me the cd key by mail and q live in Venezuela and the product It would take months to arrive?
Sorry, I do not ship international. Regards, Kelilarc's Shoppe
is it playeble on EU servers?
Yes, they have it separated by region (US, Euro, Asian/Pacific, etc.) so that people can play w/the same languages and time zones.
does this come with the lvl 90 boost?
No, that's for the purchase of the new expansion that is coming in december.
Other than activation do I have to have internet? I mean I don't want to go on line to play. I prefer to just sit here and take my time doing a solo
You HAVE to have internet. You can play solo, but other people will be there and, if offline, you cannot play.
Is this US version? like will it work on a ps3 from usa?
Yes this is US version
do it comes with art work and map
No art work, but the map is there
this is the game in physical, CD?
Yes
any guarantee the game works? it&acute;s not frozen when playing?
I have not had any problems. It works great. Is yours freezing?
Will it work on a ps3 from France?
It works for all PS3s in the world no matter what country
Is this game at all appropriate for a 13 yo boy? My son is begging me for this, and it doesnt seem appropriate IMO.
No mam it's not but they is completely up to the parent
I heard a rumor that this game will no longer work properly on the PS3. I have a 500 G system. Will it work?
I bought about a month ago and it works great. Play nearly every day and i have cloned my system to an SSD. No problems.
this have spanish lenguage
Maybe if you switch the language on your ps3, don't know otherwise
ltd guitar
Im not following your question.
is this a online game only or can be single played
It is not and "Only" online game. You may play the single player missions and/or play online multiplayer games.
i installed the game and patch is updated, when i run it it says "farcry 3 has stopped working" on the title screen. HELP! im using windows 8. THX!
Hello. Did you purchase this item from us? If so, please send us a private e-mail with your Order # and I will forward to the warehouse for response. Kind regards, IWD
i've installed and update the patch,im using windows 8 and when i run the game, it says "farcry 3 has stopped working" on the title screen, HELP!!!
Hello. Did you purchase this item from us? If so, please send us a private e-mail with your Order # and I will forward to the warehouse for response. Kind regards, IWD
Whats in the box? Just the game? If thats the case will it better to download it?
Yes, this game does include the physical disc in the case. It is your preference if you would like to own a physical copy of the game, or download a version to play.
i still have to download with the disk right ?
The game is on the disc. You install it from there, but it will need to download and install whatever patches came out after the disc was made.
will this also work with windows 7?
Yes! Regards, IWD
Will this work with windows 8?
Yes.
Does far cry 3 work with a PC xbox controller like borderlands or new vegas? It's a must have for me.
You have the option of choosing between mouse and keyboard or gamepad. Xbox controller is generally the default gamepad for pc games that support gamepads. But if you learn to use the mouse and keyboard scheme for games like this you'll never want to go back.
Do you need steam to play?
You don't need Steam. You will need UPlay. I believe even if you download it via Steam, you still need UPlay.
Does this works with xbox one too?
No
Will this work with Grand Theft Auto V?
Not well, you can use it driving but there are buttons missing to walk around so you can't walk without switching controllers :(
How do I coneect with xbox360? Once I pressed the middle button on the controller, its still blinking but not connected. Please help me.
Just like on the Xbox's main controllers, there is a connectivity button that needs to be pressed (on the back in the center of the wheel). So as you would with the main controller's press the button on the wheel that makes the lights show that they are searching for the console, and then press the small circular button on the console that is near the power button. Once they have become in sync with one another, the controller will flash a few times and then tell you which user the wheel is (ie 1, 2, 3, or 4). If this didn't help answer your question, https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/wireless-speed-wheel
What buttons do you use to shift gears?
There are different settings to choose from. I set mine to use the up and down buttons on the D Pad (in the picture, it's located on the top left of the controller). I think you can choose to use the "Y" and "A" buttons as well and I don't remember what other options there were. Probably "X" and "B" would work.
Works with Forza Motorsport 4?
Will not work with forza. It 'does' but this controller doesn't have the right and left bumper buttons, making gear shifting and other functions impossible
does it need batteries?
Yes
I just ordered this wheel but will it work with Forza Horizon 2
Very good
With this being used item, do I need anything else to buy to use this for the xbox 360?
AA batteries. Understand that it doesn't support gear changing or clutch, so you'll have to work in Automatic shifting mode. It does make driving Forza 3 and 4 a lot more fun, however, and once you get used to driving with the triggers as throttle and brake, it gets to be pretty easy to do and is a lot more like driving than a basic controller.
can u use for just playing a non racing game like minecraft
You might be able to play a few games but not too many. Minecraft isnt one of them. The controller does not have left or right bumps and the left and right sticks. Its mainly just for racing. I cant do EVERYTHING on froza 3. To fine tune my cars i have to use a regular controller. The racing wheel has GREAT response to racing games though. I was very impressed.
Will this wheel work with Nascar 14
Yes
Can you jump into Halo 4 not having played the other games?
Absolutely. I recommend that you play the story mode of Halo 4 first because this will help you become familiar with the controls. It will also introduce you to all of the weapons and vehicles
All right i'll admit it, i'm a bit challenged when it comes to some of these things. My question is-if i buy this halo 4 x box game will my grandson be able to play this on his i pod?
No, sir. That would prove impossible. Halo is available only for Microsoft XBOX 360. I would vote to have it on my iPad, though I'd guess Microsoft would have a fit if their competitor were to posses their precious game. Hope this helps!
why is it rated m
"Mature" do to the killing
do you have to have xbox live to play this game?
no single player you can do locally from your house but to do multiplayer you will need a online live card, *Online multiplayer and Spartan Ops missions require Xbox LIVE Gold membership (sold separately).
Is it 2 player?
Yes, 2 players Co-op.
Is there realistic blood-gore?
I don't remember it being gory. I play (try) the horror games that are really gory and gross though. I think there is some blood but not major. Again, I haven't played it much and my daughter isn't too happy when I play with her because I always end up killing her. I think it should be rated T instead of M because it really isn't that bad from what I seen when I watch her play. My daughter is 20 now but she has had all of the Halo games. It is a shooter game, so there is violence and some blood...but I would not classify it as extreme as the COD games (Call of Duty). I just talked to my daughter and she said it's not gory.
Does this game come with codes you can enter on the xbox?
If you are refering to a xbox live trial, then yes, or at least it did when I bought it.
Can I play in online mode, if I buy a pre-owned game?
As long as you pay your monthly subscription to Xbox live you can play online.
is there profanity and sexual content in this game? thank you
No.
what does it mean "standard game", just the story or you can play online, or what??
Standard game. Comes with campaign and multiplayer (includes online). Standard just means no DLC included, nothing extra.
Will I have to have played 1 &amp; 2 in order to follow the story?
I picked up the story after a few minutes. They pretty much flash back the entirety of the first two games. The story however isn't really that relevant to the game play.
How long is this campaign?
If you take the game seriously and don't run through it like an idiot then it should last you about 7 1/2 hours, by that i mean, using cover, scanning around, using some stealth, thats how much time i got
Does this game have English subtitles?
Yes, for most of the game play it does.
In the game stills, I can see the playable character. Does this mean it has a 3rd person view option?
SADLY NO, perhaps but its only when you killed online like in battlefield
how much blood
Very little....you can handle it.
Is this the Hunter Edition like on the picture used?
Yes, the hunter edition looks and plays better than what you see.
do you need a code like most EA games to play the multiplayer
No code need since ea stopped that policy' I thought you meant predator edition extra code. No you don't need it because ea stopped that policy so that means any ea game is playable without a code.
Is Crysis 3 a co-op/multiplayer game?
Crysis 3 has a single player campaign and has multiplayer which you can battle others online.
is crysis 3 a multiplayer game?
Not the regular game. I am not sure if the XBox live version is. I do not have XBox live.
does this game have a multi player mode
Yes it does just that the lobbies are pretty empty now. Not a lot of people play the multiplayer anymore but you can get lucky to meet a few players there. You can also arrange games with your friends who have the game too. Hope it helps.
Is this game enjoyable to play as a single player game?
Yes I find Borderlands 2 enjoyable single & multi-player.
Should I buy Borderlands 1 first or go straight to Borderlands 2?
If you want to follow along the story lines and understand who the characters are in boardlands 2 then I would say yes. If you would like to just jump both feet into a game and start blazing away then no. If I had never played the first borderlands before playing the second it would be just as enjoyable.
what is the best person to use in the borderlands 2 game?
They all have their strengths, it really comes down to how you want to play and who you think looks the coolest. Do you want to start as the quick elemental sorceress, the robot assassin, the jacked and crazy bezerker, or the more standard, but very adaptable soldier? And, each one allows a good amount of playstyle customization as you go. That's not even bringing up the downloadable mechromancer and psycho... Or you can just start one of each and try them all out!
Can I use this game with the game of the year edition add on content? Thanks.
I'm not quite sure, since i haven't purchased any if its DLCs, but gamerfaq.com might be of assistance. Hope it helps!
I've never had a game consol. How do PS3 and Xbox compare?
Well I never had a PS3 before but from my experience with friends and other people the Xbox is better. While the ps4 is good, the Xbox is better then the PS3. I am not 100% sure on what makes the PS3 better or worse then Xbox, but if you Are asking my opinion, buy the Xbox.
Do you have to hook this up to play it online or can you just get the updates and play offline?
If you want the updates then you have to hook it in. But there really isn't updates at this point. There is one update as soon as you play to play online, I am pretty sure you need to be online. But playing online is5 really that different then offline, the only difference is obviously more players, but the enemies get stronger.
Does the game brings the voices in Spanish?
I believe so, but I am not sure.
Does it support local co-op like the first one? My girlfriend and I really enjoyed playing it together.
Yes.
why is it rated m
Plenty of violence -- blood, gunshot wounds, heads being blown off, hatchets, etc. Some sexual innuendo, but nothing too blatant (at least so far -- I haven't completed the game).
Is the game brings the voices or subtitle in Spanish?
Not this version. There may be a spanish version available though.
What does Lto mean What does Lto mean?
I believe LTO mean " Limited Time Offer"
What does the "Standard LTO" edition come with and what does "Standard LTO" mean?
It is the game itself and inside the cover you will find the code for the first map pack so you can download it for free. Not sure what LTO means, you can just google that and you'll find out.
How busy are the servers today?
Sorry I'm out of town.
Does the DLC code still work
Yup, mine came with a working DLC code. Just make sure your buying from a buyer with a good rating.
Is the sever either for multiplayer or zombie still working???
Yes it is
What zombie maps are on this game?
The Maps that come standard are KINO, DEAD OPS ARCADE, and FIVE. Also with the 1st map pack 'First strike ' included here, are an additional Zombie map called Ascension.
What is the file size of this?
im not sure but its not that long of a game. mine froze after playing for an hour!
Can I still play this game online as of July 2014?
Yes, you can play Zombies and Multiplayer online.
What does the "Standard LTO" edition come with and what does "Standard LTO" mean?
It just came with ascension bundle. Guessing limited time offer I could be wrong ;)
can you play it on the ps4?
no way this is a ps3 version ONLY, its a great great game, but violent
Call of duty black ops LTO Edition x box is it black ops 1
Yes. This comes with a free DLC code as we'll.
Does it come with the zombie pack?
No pack, however it does have a zombies node ready to play when you start.
do people still play online
Yes
What DLC does it come with?
It comes with first strike. Still a better deal than paying full price for that map pack and buying a different game that doesn't come with it.
is this a digital download for xbox 360? i wanna play today, but i dont wanna wait for shipping.
It was bought for my grandson. It was the actual game
Can multiple players play this without being online?
yes
Why is this game rated m?
M means mature content Violence's and graphic language this game has both
is the map pack DLC code or in the disc?
Yes it is.
Can a 12 year old boy play this game? And not have it to many curse words
I would not recommend this game for anyone under 18 years old because of the language and violence. Yes, it is a military based game but that doesn't mean a child should be playing it.
Is this battery compatible with a PSP 2001?
It will work but it is only 1000 mA. That is smaller than the 1800 mA they came with your system. Almost all the replacement batteries are 1800 mAh. This will only hold a charge about half as long as the battery that came with your system. It will work, but you will probably regret paying twice as much for half the battery. Like I do.
compat w 3001?
Yes. This battery works in 2000 and 3000 series PSP's. The Lenmar battery is also the one I would recommend. It has been very reliable and was also pretty cheap. Also be sure to update the OS to the final release (version 6.60) especially if you decide to jailbreak your PSP. That way you won't need a pandora battery to install nploader or whatever alternate os you decide to use.
how long is the play time hours
It plays fine for me after a full charge, although I don't play it very long at a time. Probably 2 hours max play time. I did drain it fully the first time after I charged it fully - and it took over 2 hours to drain, but I only turned off all power save features, and was not using any network. My complaint with the battery is that it drains when NOT in use. So, I have it fully charged, and then 2 weeks later it is completely dead. It does charge up again ok. The reason I purchased this one is that the battery has a 1 yr warranty.
Does this collection run on Windows 8?
I do not use Win 8 as of yet. From what I have heard there is a compatibility issue trying to run it on Win 8. However you could download and install "VMWARE player" and if you have a copy of Winxp, you can install it after installing VMWARE. It is a pretty cool program. I have tested it out and was quite impressed by it. You may have to buy the program though once your trial period ends.
DRM-Free? Are the games in this compilation DRM-Free?
Good Question something I'd like to know as well. However you can buy all these on GOG.com DRM Free and you can burn them to a cd/dvd. They come with installer and everything. just go here to check it out--&gt; http://www.gog.com/catalogue/strategy
Can this be played on a mac?
the one i bought was for windows only.
Does this work with Win 7 x64: Does anyone know if this version is compatible with Windows 7 64-bit.
Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
Resolution Prob: Anyone know how to fix the resolution prob to have the ability to see the whole screen in M&amp;M I?
Compatability mode 256 colors check
Can it be played on the dsi xl 2d?
It can be played on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS. It can not be played on any earlier systems, including any DS or DSi.
Does it work on the 3DS XL?
Yes it works on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS.
Pok&eacute;mon rookie here. If it get one son X and one Y, can they battle each other?
Yes they can! They would each need to have a separate 3DS though.
i dont know if anyone answered this already but whats the difference with X and Y?
Well I know about the games so here what you need to know. On X you can catch Xerneas in x only. and on Y you can catch Yveltal only in y in Team Flare headquarters in the game. And on Y there are some pokemon and mega stones you can get only on Y . And on X there are some pokemon and stones you can only can get only on X unless you trade pokemon from y and x with someone with the games.Mega Mewtwo and Charizard Mega forms are different in x and y. In X mega charizard x is blue with an Chrariarizard X stone only in x .And in y Charizard Y is orange with a Charizardite Y stone. And mega mewtwo in y has a different form as mega mewtwo y with mewtwoite y only in y.and in x you get mega mewtwo X form with a Mewtwonite X stone only in x. If you want you buy pokemon x and y pokedex guide from Amazon and you will see the difference and it will show you everything you need to know if you have anymore questions about the games. This answer is right.I know a lot about pokemon games if you need to ask anymore questions about these game just ask. I hope this was useful. HAVE A NICE DAY!
Why does this cost more than Y?
It could be due to the differing mega evolutions and Pokemon. Xerneas is a beast.
Does this game brings Multi Language?
Yes it has.
does this play on the dsi xl 2d?
I believe it onky plays on the 3ds and 2ds, not the dsi
Hi. We're new to Pokemon. Just bought my daughter a 3DS. Would Pokemon X be a good game to learn about the game for a beginner? Any recommendations?
Every Pokemon game starts in a new region the mechanics and plot of the game are always re introduced at the beginning of every game as long as she can read she will be able to understand the Pokemon world so yes Pokemon X is good for beginners as its a new region and the 6th generation of pokemon
If I were to only get one, Would you recommend X or Y? I'm new to pokemon and have only played the Yellow Game on the Original Gameboy with Pikachu
It really does depend on which legendary Pokemon you like better--I liked the Xerneas, so I went with X. One of my sisters has Y, and she likes it just as much as I like X. So, I may recommend X, because that's the one I got, but they're basically the same game :)
Can you enjoy this game by yourself, or do you have to be in connectivity mode and do multiplayer?
Absolutely. The game can be enjoyed either way. You don't have to be connected if you'd rather enjoy single player.
Can it be played on the dsi xl 2d?
It can be played on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS. It can not be played on any earlier systems, including any DS or DSi.
Does it work on the 3DS XL?
Yes it works on the 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS.

Absolutely. The game can be enjoyed either way. You don't have to be connected if you'd rather enjoy single player.
does it play on a new 2ds?
Yes. Any 3DS game is playable on the 2DS. You simply don't get the 3D option during some of gameplay.
Which languages does it have? Is Spanish included?
It has a choice of 7 languages. Spanish is one of them.
what is the difference between X and Y?
The difference between x and y are the pokemon available. There are a few pokemon that are specific to x or y (like larvitar in y and aron in x for example). Additionally, in x the legendary you get is Xerneas and you get yveltal in y. There are also two different mega evolutions of charizard depending on which game you have. Visit serebii.net and check out the x and y pokedex to see which pokemon are available in each game.
Do I need two of these to play with another player with a second 2DS or will one upload to the other?
Each system requires its own copy of the game to play multiplayer, if you plan to get two copies, then one of you should get pokemon Y and the other one should get Pokemon X so you can complement each other with the things your version lacks.
Do they ship the correct version based on ur region? Eg PAL to NZ and Europe, Or do they only ship American NTSC version?
My friend sent me the NTSC version I guess it was because buy from Venezuela! Greetings!
is it playable on ds or dsi
Pokemon Y is only 3DS this game does not work on DS OR DSi.
Is Pokemon X and y a good entry for someone who has never played any Pokemon game at all but does love to play RPG's?
Totally yes. The game is very fast paced and easy to learn, you will have zero issues even if you haven't played any of the games released before.
is one of the languages available French ?
Yes.
Will this work on a DS? I ordered it before I realized my son does not have a 3DS
you should cancel your order, this only works with a 3DS. But if you buy a 3DS, your son can play either DS and 3DS games, hope this helps you.
Can you use a DS or DSI?
Yes, d's or dsi

Works in the 2ds?
Yes! All 3ds games work great in the 2ds. We have had no trouble.
this in Spanish?
Most 3DS games have the language set to what your system's language is set to.
Could a 5 yo play this?
Totally. Maybe he/she would be terrible at first. But the kid could learn. I, as a 'kid' myself, can say it. When I was five, I loved this games, so somehow I managed to learn how to play it. Mario Kart is a game for all ages! No matter how old you are, you will always have fun playing it! :)
Does this game work on a 3DS XL?
Of course! The 3DS XL is just a different 3DS model, not an entirely different game system
Do both players need to have game cartridges for two people to play on wifi?
Yes, if you wish to play with someone far away from where you are, you both need cartridges...you can play on wireless though, without cartidges. Although the person without the cartridge will be a Shy Guy. Have a nice day :)
will Mario Kart 7 work on our 4 year old Wii
No, Mario kart 7 only works on the 3ds, but it is a heck of a lot better then the wii version in quality and features, and it supports some of the courses from the Wii, SNES, and another console that I don't remember, but with some exclusive courses as well.
will this work in the 3dsxl
Yes, its fully supported only difference is screen/unit size in 3DS-XL.
Is this the Greatest Hits version? I don't want the red box.
Mine did not come w a case
Can the downloaded game be shared wirelessly (with someone in same room)?
It can be shared wirelessly with someone in the same room

Can more then one person have a house in New Leaf just like in Animal Crossing City Folks?
Yup :) Up to four playable characters and houses, the first person created will be Mayor and the rest will just be villagers :)
I've never played any of the Animal Crossing games before. Do you have to have played the previous games for this one to make sense?
No! The game is mostly plotless honestly. Its very relaxing and the goals that one can obtain within the game require no alternative knowledges from previous versions!
can you play this game on the old Nintendo DSi
Sadly no, you can however get a similar game called Animal Crossing: Wild World.
Can you play 2 player with just 1 cartridge (2 3ds) or do you need to purchase it 2x for 2 player?
Yes. It is possible for you both to play on one game card. However, the game saves to the cartridge, not the actual system itself. Therefore, you will have to share the same town. The only problem is that one of you will be the mayor, and the other will be a resident in the town. It doesnt affect much except your ability to create public works projects and create ordinances, really something the two of you can discuss in person and work out in the real world. Other than that, the game will be almost identical, except for some of the villagers not calling you the mayor.
what age group would enjoy this game the most
I feel as though age varies with this game (and previous versions). I am 22 and love playing AC, and have since I was 12. All age groups can play given that it doesn't have a difficult story line or controls. I would even venture to say that children as young as 7 or 8 could play AC. Hope this helps a little.
what ages is it for?
I haven't been playing for long but I reckon its fine for all ages :) hope this helps
Does this game work with a 3ds xl?
Yes it does
Will this game play on a 2DS?
Yes. All DS games as well as all 3DS games will play on a 2DS.
Will this game work for the European N3DS?
I am able to interact with other AC players around the world. I do not know if they are using the same game device (3DS) and game as we have in the USA. Wish I could have been more help.

Does this come with a bluetooth doggle or does the charging stand act as the receiver?
The Razer Mamba is a hybrid design wireless mouse where the charging station acts as the receiver for the mouse signal. The USB connection on the charging unit is also the same cable you move to your Mamba to put it in wired mode.
How is the mamba's tracking while wired? I don't intend to use the wireless at all. I currently use a 3500 Deathadder
The Mamba works great while hard wired. I owned a Death Adder prior to the Mamba and performance is identical. The only difference is that the Mamba has two extra buttons and a little more weight.
What is the difference between this version and the mamba elite?
Better battery life on the elite and RGB lighting. That also claim better wireless.
Can I use a USB extension cable to connect the charging station to my computer?
The charging station cable is mini usb on one end, and usb on the other. I don't see why you wouldn't be able to use an extender cable on the end of that. I would think it'd work just fine.
Can anyone who bought this from dealfisher confirm that is the latest version? Thanks.
Yes!!! Just got it April 17th and it works great.
Does this mouse have the same input lag as a wired mouse compared to my DeathAdder? I would love to use it for CSGO
Yes it does, I actually use this mouse when I play CSGO and it's pretty much the perfect mouse for that game.
Want to be sure I'm getting the latest product. Can someone confirm this has 6400dpi?
Yes, it's the latest product, got mine a few days ago.
Does it work with a MAC computer
It does, But I very strongly recommend against the purchase of this mouse or any Razer product for that matter. The software necessary to use this mouse properly is terrible, constant crashes and extremely slow. The mouse hardware is constrcued quite poorly. It feels cheaply made. After I have owned it for just over a year I have had consistent issues with the device. Razer's support hasn't been any help and frankly neglected my issues with the device.
how long is the battery life?
it is rechargeable. i don't know for sure how long it lasts because i just plug it in each night. i use it at my office at work.
want to know the dimensions of the shipping box. I guess they are not the same dimensions as those of the product in its original box?
i got a big box because i got 2 of them, i don't know what happens if there is only one.
Will it run on Windows 8?
I really don't know - I have Windows 7. I will tell you that I was somewhat disappointed with Jigsaw World. The problem is that it doesn't save what you've done on a puzzle. If you get half the puzzle done & then have to leave, you have to start over when you go back to the game.
Will it download on Windows 7?
yes. on vista also which is what I have.

I have a Sony BRAVIA XBRHX929 TV and wondering if I need a 3d Synch xmitter along w/ these glasses or will it synch/work directly with the TV ?
You would NOT need a 3D emitter because your TV has one built-in as does mine (KDL-55HX729).
will these work with the viewsonic pjd5133? thanks!
To be honest im not completely sure i know there not compatible with most dlp projectors because these glasses use ir to work. dlp link devices use some type of flash to work. some projectors(not all) have a ir emitter. you can buy and a setting to disable dlp link, but it would be better to find a decently priced set of 3d glasses that have the dlp link function. it may cost a little more but at least you will know they definitely work correctly hope that helps
where can i get a charger for these glasses?????
Each new pair comes with a cable. It is a standard USB micro Type B and can be purchased any where online, like Amazon.com or Monoprice.com. If you need it right now, most big box stores, like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Radio Shack will have them also at a much higher price. Hope this helps.
what does sony ps3 games mean when they say 3d compatable
It means those games with 3d compatable can be played in 3d mode, where u would need the 3d glasses to see it displayed in 3d, but it also has the regular mode which is called 2d. So u should have the option to select 3d or 2d/regular on those types of ps3 games.
would they work with the sony VPL-HW40ES
These glasses will work with this projector. It has a built in IR transmitter.
So Confused... I sit there watching something and the room randomly gets much brighter or dimmer. is something wrong with the glasses?
When the infrared sensors do not receive a signal from the TV the glasses shut down, and the room is brighter. When they are receiving the signal the room is dimmer. Solution: sit a bit closer to the emitter on the TV.
I ordered these Sony 3D glasses thinking I read a review saying they would work with my Epson 5020 but I can't get them to. Any suggestions?
I do not have the Epson 5020, but from what I have read, the Epson 5020 uses RF glasses whereas the PS3 glasses are IR (infra-red). So they would not be compatible. I read that the previous Epson model used IR, so maybe that is where the confusion comes in.
I have Sony Bravia 55HX800 3D TV (with external 3D transmitter), PS3 and PS4. Also, 2 3D glasses for the TV. Will these PS3 versins work with them?
Yes
my tv is a Samsung and infrared / shutter/ battery glasses. one of the first 3d tv. will they work ? I really want them for mulitplayer
As far as I know, they should work perfectly. My 2010 Samsung TV also uses infrared and shutter glasses. I believe Samsung switched to bluetooth in 2011. I haven't played any 3D games with the system, but 3D movies work fine.
Are these glasses Adult Size?
Yes
Amazon changed Resistance3 for Motorstorm Apocalypse while every other place is offering it with R3? I'm not really happy with Amazon's change of bundle, specially since i order it exactly as it was advertise by Sony at E3 &amp; by Amazon's website.So...
It's not just Amazon...Sony changed it.
when is the 3d monitor released?
My guess is it will be released in September along with Resistance 3. They didn't state an approximate date but it would make sense since: 1 copy of Resistance 3: $60 1 6' 1.4 standard HDMI cable: $28 1 pair of 3D glasses: $70 Making the TV roughly $342 If they wait too much longer after the release of Resistance 3 the value of the additional content outside of the TV starts to drop, making it become less of a deal. At the release of Resistance 3 they'd have the sweet spot for buyers and the potential to sell tons.
Will other 3D glasses with the SimulView Display? Since this only ships with the one 3D glass, could we use our existing Bravia 3D glasses or any other 3D glasses with the display, specifically for the SimulView?
It's important to note that Sony is probably crippling SimulView capability through EDID, so that in addition needing games that support it (most currently do jot) and glasses that support it (most currently do not) it is probably also necessary to have an EDID spoofer which fools the PS3 into thinking the monitor attached is the Sony SimulView (tm).
Why is the Playstation 3DTV only have 5000 for contrast ratio? Shouldn't LED be in the "millions" contrast ratio?
Never listen to the contrast ratio provided by manufacturers unless they're talking about static contrast. Anyone can throw out a ridiculous number out there like 1000000000:1, there isn't a standardized way of measuring contrast.
normal tv functions? for example, can i also have my xbox360/wii hooked up to this?
You can hook up anything to it that can be done so via HDTV or component cables. However, in regards to your title asking if it has "normal tv functions", it does NOT have a built in tuner. This is why Tretton called it a monitor, rather than a TV.
Monitor's function as a computer display? Hey everyone, given the specs of this display, how do you think this monitor would function in terms of a computer monitor, say if I ever wanted to plug a mac mini or something of the sort into it and use it...
This was going to be a sellin point for me, I would love to hook it up to my computer in the office and bring the PS3 in there as well, Hope they all play well together
Which should we buy Playstation 3D Display or HMZ-T1? Which sould we buy?
Just FYI if you play multiplayer online the hmz does not have a mic so how r we gonna converse with other players...if they fix this I'd get it.
Resistance 3???? Does it still come with Resistance 3???
I contacted Amazon customer service and rep forwarded questions regarding the pre-order bonus to marketing. Will get an answer one way or another in 1-2 business days. Let's hope the Resistance 3 bonus comes back to Amazon!
Vesa mount?
I have one mounted, but it is NOT a standard VESA mount. It's not even square; it's rectangular. I had to cut my own adapter plate from another piece of rack mount hardware. I consulted with a Sony Store clerk before I did it. He suggested making your own adapter. But it can be done. I mounted mine on an arm. There's a subwoofer on the back, and if you mount it on the wall, you'll be covering and muffling it, but it can be done.
What's the general opinion on the PlayStation 3D Display?
Here are a few specs if you need them: http://us.playstation.com/corporate/about/press-release/ps3-3d-display-in-fall-2011.html I really wish this tv was a little cheaper but I can't complain with what it offers. I don't enjoy playing split screen too much because of having to share the tv, but I think that this will help a lot with that. Because I don't have a 3d tv, I also feel like it would be something new and fun to me. I never enjoyed shutter glasses but these look much more comfortable than what is on the market right now. Overall, I wish I could choose a game other than resistance cause I already preordered it, or even just get the tv by itself, but besides this it is a very cool piece of technology that I can hopefully get.
I see some customers got the wrong drive. How do I make sure I get the correct drive for my 360?
open your 360 and read the label on the drive to see which Manufacturer and model # you need before you order the drive
My model number is DG-16D2S but my MS P/N is X800474-008 and the P/N for this product is X899474-010. Are they interchangeable?
Yes, I have two different 360 Xbox's I changed over with the above unit. one had P/N X800474-010 the other unit X800474-008.
Hi will the DG-16D2S, Phillips Lite-on Drive for Xbox 360 fit in the xbox 360 SLIM, or did i buy the wrong drive?
You should have disassembled you SLIM and determined the exact drive before you ordered. Other than that don't have a clue.
I have the Lite-On drive and was manufactured JUL 2009. Not sure of the exact model #, should I re-open and provide model prior to ordering?
There are a couple different models so you want to make sure you order the right one
On my Xbox the model no. is correct (dg16ds2) but the PLDS part no. is 3b412160031 not like yours which is 3b41216033 Is this drive right for me?
It depends, when I purchased this drive it was for the sole reason that my reader and tray were shot. Instead of swapping the drivers completely I simply swapped the reader and tray from the new one to the old. This was so i didn't have to bother with firmware updates in order to make the dvd player read the games. Hope this helps!
Is this for xbox 360 phat or xbox 360 slim?
Phat 360
Will it work for my xbox 360 arcade
Yes
What do I need to do if i get this drive in order to play legally purchased games?
if u bought games on line than the mother boeard in th disk drive has to be paired to the one in the x box or you'll never be able to log in to e box live well x-box live wont let u log in unless the mother board in the disk drive is paired to the 1 in your x box. reprograming is extensive work, or just swap out the electronics & soilder the connections...problemed solved or u could be banned from x box live 4 life on the unit dont freak if its simple... otherwise you'll just be playing dvds
My XBOX 360 drive is the DG-16D2S-09C and does not work, if I order the same model, I just have to switch it and my XBOX will work without any problem
Oh heck no there is some weenie circuit board on the original drive that needs to match the your xbox. Read up on this for sure. I just sold the old xbox 360 and got the new xbox 360e which is real nice.
I have a liteon dg-16d2s that went bad and I have a dg-16d2s-09c, can I just switch keys on that and be safe online?
The two models do not matter, any 16D2S-09C can also be swapped with a 16D2S and vice versa, it is the same drive. As far as online safe no one can really know for sure but Microsoft themselves but you should be fine.
are the thumstick controls more presise then the original,for the original controller sticks are too loose.
Sorry Don't know I bought it for my Son
Does it work with PC? I've seen some reviews saying it works perfectly with PC and others saying there are no drivers found and any other drivers don't work with it. I would like some confirmation from someone who has purchased it before I go ahead and...
X box is a Microsoft program base the controllers are soposed to work on Microsoft games...However I could not find a driver that would allow the controller to work full time on everything.....but hey I don't know everything
Is there a special headset that can fit these? My Xbox mic does not fit properly in the input.
Not that I'm aware of, but you probably want to check further online. I did not use a headset with this controller. Better yet see what options are available that were bought with this product.
PC
Controller came to my house broken!
Can I get another RF re ciever I believe I lost mine
Hi,it's work well only in Batman play.....
why won't my batarang controller connect to my ps3? Turn it on and the blue controller lights flash for short period and then shut off.
Have you tried connecting it with the USB cord? I returned mine because once I took it off the cord, it shut off, and wouldn't go back on.
Where do I find a copy of the Quick Start Guide to download for the batarang controller ps3 wireless
if u know someone that has one they can copy it for you other than that not really sure,the batarang was limited at the time it came out, I had trouble finding parts for it, so I purchased another one. the first one sits on a shelf , n I use the 2nd one to play games.
i bought one of these controllers and like it doesn't turn on without being plugged in to the charger is there a way to fix that
I ordered this controller twice and neither worked without being plugged in. They're mostly defective and I suggest you submit a return.
My controller wont turn on when i put it in my ps3 or anything else. Any tips?
The one I had the cord was damaged. I had to play with the cord
Is this controller good for Dark souls 1 on pc?
No
Is this controller good for Dark souls pc?
No
Does this count as a dual shock 3 controller?
not sure what you mean but it doesn't have SIXAXIS and the rumble function works nicely also I have made quite a few videos on YouTube with it its the controller I use the most on the ps3 I hope that answered your question
Does this work on PS4? If not, then is there any similar product to this one for PS4?
I just plugged it into my Ps4 and nothing happen so I would have to say it doesn't work with the Ps4 as for your second question I don't think any third party company's have made a controller for the Ps4 yet sorry
I can't seem to get it to connect. Any help/suggestions/directions?
Connect it to both usb ports and then push the ps button in the middle. If that doesn't work then push the other two buttons. If that doesn't work then you have a faulty controller and you should send it back
can this be used on windows PC?
I haven't tried it yet, but every ps3 controller works on a pc, so this one should easily work as well.
Hello, does this controller have sixaxis support?
Not sure, but it broke after a week
I have this controller and was wondering if anyone had the same problem with the left analog stick not responding, if so, what do i do to fix it?
you cant do anything about it which sucks i have a problem with the controller not working on my ps3 this controller over all is junk
What kind of plug does this have? I'm looking for s USB controller.
Its a USB. A good one too.
For players who prefer to fight solo rather than with a crew or clan, is this game still enjoyable?
Absolutely. In fact, while it's online, I would say it's pretty much a solo game. There are times when you're working with others, but it's not a communication/coordination thing. It's a great way to just sit back and play solo for an hour or two, and the addiction is good for a month or maybe two
"Free to Play" just announced. Does it still require XBox Live Gold paid subscription?
Yes it does. It is a online only game.
How often do "special missions" or "events" happen, and what type of mission are they usually?
Pretty often like once an hour or so. And they vary. Sometimes its an elimination or its a search and rescue. You never know.
I realize that its an MMO, but do you need a Gold membership on Xbox live even if you just want to play single player? Is there even single player?
You need gold.It's only made for online
Does this game force you into PvP scenarios, or are you mainly fighting WITH or AROUND other players, but AGAINST AI enemies?
You are more often fighting alongside other players in a competitive nature. But you only encounter PvP if you specifically choose to join a PvP event
I hear everyone saying you need a XBOX Live Gold membership to play Defiance. Is there a XBOX Live and an XBOX Live Gold .Is there a difference?
NO A gold membership is the same as being an Xbox live member. If you play the PC version it is free period and you can just download Defiance but if you want this versions for Xbox 360 you will need a current membership. But to answer your main question Xbox live is Xbox Gold they are one and the same you pay $9.99 per month and that is it not twice and not for any separate service.
Why does it take long for Defiance game to download when you start the game?
If I'm remembering right, it's because the game is being updated from a server not related to Microsoft, and that server has (at least had) very limited bandwidth; also be prepared for the actual gameplay to be as slow and stuttering as the download.
is there split screen option
Yes you can create a local match to play with friends and family but I do not see a matchmaking option for a guest for the online portion.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how difficult is it to play the first couple hours of the game?
This game is easy to play. It takes 'Forever' to download though. But, once it's downloaded - Let The Games Begin!!! It seems like everybody's playing it! Including me!
when will there be a defiance strategy guide book for xbox 360 ?
Probably never. They have shutdown their servers.
Can I hook up the Tritton Trigger Headset to my PC?
I haven't tried, but I believe so... it uses USB for power, and then red & white RCAs for signal... if your soundcard has RCA outs, or a converter, you should be fine...
Will this headset plug into a cordless phone handset. Does it have a 2.5mm plug
no. it the standard 3.5mm, also, it may not work with cordless phone handset as you also requires usb as well.
how can i use this with the xbox 360 e if i am using hdmi
Hello, The Trigger headset comes equipped with an HDMI adapter that will allow for the RCA connection to be bypassed.
Will it work with Xbox One?
If you have the adapter that you can get for Xbox One. It should work. But only if you have the adapter.
is this headset compatible with the Xbox 360 elite
Yeah with any version because the controller is the same and the USB port as well
will the tritton trigger work on a mobil phone or tablet?
Yes. You can remove the Mic if you're just listening to music and the cable coming from the headset is a 3.5 mm standard for most regular audio services. So again short answer yes for sure.
If I'm making a video, will it hear my voice ?
Yes
Does it work for an Xbox 360 slim
Yes
I want to use this headset to play destiny and Im planning to play 20 hours each week how long do you guys think they will last?
Well, the head set comes with extra batteries and it also has a charge point the recharges ur batteries as soon as the light goes from red to green. Just switch the batteries and keep game'n they last hours and hours. Sometimes I don't switch the batteries for a few days . Hope that helped? Let me know Pablo
one question that headset can work whit ps3?
No.
does it work with the xbox one console?
No it says it specifically on the xbox adapter page on xbox.com that it does not work with the xbox one.
do this headset only work on the xbox 360 , or will it work for my computer too?
Dude, unplug is from the adapter, plug into your computer's headphone jack, and rock out. I use it for Twitch live streaming every day in the chat. Whenever there's a teamp speak, I'm already set up because I have the mic in the headset. Win, win. Just, don't jam too hard, they have a habit of blowing out on one side (left/right) and you're stuck listening in just your right ear. I've only had to buy a new one in the past 2 /12 years so, don't sweat it too hard. Hope that helps brother!!
do these headsets drop the sound every few seconds like the turtle beach x32's??
They never seemed to "drop the sound" for me or lose any connectivity, but I've also used a pair of TB's x32's and didn't seem to have that problem either.
are these wired or wireless because somebody said and i quote "These are wired but can come wireless"
Hello! These are wireless.
Does it have memoryfoam or what king of ear cups does it have?
No memory foam. They work well for my kids but I found that I can ware them for more than 45 minutes or so before they start hurting, where as I can wear my Bose headphones all day. I hope that helps. All and all they are very nice and great sound but it you have more of a round head they don't fit well.
Why is the microphone so weak? I have to almost move the microphone into my mouth for it to register my voice.
We haven't had any issue. They hear us loud and clear for a foot or so away.
Will these support chat via the xbox one headset adapter?
I'm not sure ..I would guess to say no. Seems these are for the X box 360
Will this work on my PC? I have another headset I want but the battery packs are cool. If it works on pc, is it wireless?
***Referring to Tritton "Triggers" not Tritton "Warheads"*** Not 100% sure it will work on PC, but it works with smartphones the same way typical hands free ear buds do. So I'm pretty sure they do. They are not wireless. And the biggest drawback to tho headset is that the cable that connects from the headset itself to the volume controller is only about 2 1/2 feet long, but the cables from the volume controller to the ends where they plug up are about 10 feet long. They hook up via RCA connection and a USB power supply. I do believe there is a wireless version to these that costs a little more.
Would these work if I plug them into the optical port on back of tv?
Yes
Can you use these on xbox one?
Yes
What is the shipping weight for this stick? Is it really 4 pounds?? I'm from Venezuela so the shipping weight is critical for my purchase!
Yes it is.
How many buttons does this Stick have? To be more precise does this Stick have buttons for PPP and KKK?
It has a total of six buttons, each mapped to buttons on the PS3 controller. Has alternative setting that work off of switches. Great stick, for sure.
Will this work with the Disney Infinity games? I bought a different one specifically to use with those and for some reason it won't work.
I mostly use it on PC, but sometimes PS3 and I've never run into a game it doesn't "work" on. That being said, the L1 and L2 buttons are not very conveniently placed. If those buttons are used much for Disney Infinity, you might consider an arcade stick with an 8-button layout instead.
Will it work on PS4?
as of now, no. might need to mod it further.
Am I able to upgrade the joystick? It's a little wobbly and I prefer it to be a bit tighter. Personal preference.
Hi Will, I know of two methods to tighten the joystick on the V3 without upgrading the joystick or replacing parts. Hopefully one of these two methods will solve your problem (you can even do both). They both start the same way so let's begin. 1. Remove the seven screws on the back of the arcade stick (not the four holding the rubber feet on) to open up the controller. 2. Unscrew and remove the square gate (white plastic piece directly beneath the joystick) - Here is where the two methods differ. I have tried both but the easier one (which worked well for me) I will write first. Method 1: Electrical Tape This is an easier sort of quick fix that's guaranteed to reduce the wiggle room in your joystick. 3. Move the four black pieces (exposed after taking the square gate off) away from the white cylinder piece in the middle. *Remember the orientation of these four pieces for when you put it back together* 4. Wrap around the white cylinder with electrical tape. I believe any tape would do, electrical tape is just a precaution. 5. Test the tightness of the stick by screwing the four black pieces back down and playing with the stick. Add more tape as needed. 6. Reverse every step all the way back to one to put the stick back together. Method 2: Tightening the Spring This one would be just as easy as putting tape on if it wasn't for removing the c shaped clamp. You'll see once you try (or maybe I just suck, lol). One of the videos at the bottom shows how to take the clamp off. 3. On top of the white cylindrical piece there is a screw and a metal c shaped clamp. Remove the c shaped clamp. 4. This cylinder should come apart, dislodging the joystick and exposing a spring. Stretch the spring (the longer the spring, the tighter the joystick). 5. If you are comfortable taking off and putting on the metal c clamp, feel free to test out the joystick and adjust the spring to your liking. (This was very difficult for me on my V3 which is why I went with method #1 even though this method seems more professional.) 6. Put the stick back together by reversing every step back to step one. Here are some videos to help if I was confusing or left out details. Removing the square gate on a V3: youtube.com/watch?v=zNOE95P4lYY start at 0:00 and stop at 1:30, the rest isn't important for what you're doing Using Method 2 to tighten the spring: youtube.com/watch?v=4K2ONYAapOQ start at 2:26 and stop at 4:30, again the rest isn't important Contact me if you have any questions.
Will this stick work with a Win8 PC?
It would. Mine ran on a Mac and Windows 7. It works well on everything.
is it wireless or wired?
This stick is wired. Quite honestly... I never mess with wireless sticks :P
does it have L1 and L2 buttons? the picture doesnt show any
In the top next to the PS and start button I believe.
How does this compare to the Qanba q1?
We'll the vx fight stick uses hori parts(stick&buttons) and the q1 uses qanba made parts.if you have extra money get a qanba q4 it's works with ps3/360/PC and uses sanwa parts for only $150.go to eightarc.com for more details.good luck
How easy is it to put custom artwork on this? Can't seem to find any tutorials for it
Difficult. The reason being is because in order to get artwork on properly, you would want to remove the buttons. In order to do so though, you would need to desolder the buttons because this stick does not have quick disconnects. Best option would be to look into possibly getting a laminated label that it sticky at the bottom but those usually aren't great
work in windows 8.1 64bits?
I'm not really sure Becuase I have not tryed it, but I too I have windows 8 And I use my regular x box remote controller and it worked, so I'm assuming It should. It is USB afterall. Well hope this was helpful. Kind regards.
Is it wireless and would it be good for playing Mz PacMan
It is not wireless but the stick has a nice feel and clicks in a most satisfying way. I use it for fighting games but see no reason why it would not work well for mz pacman or any other classic game.
How easy is it to mod with sanwa parts?
Well, I heard that the buttons are soldered onto the stick and that it would be moderately difficult to mod when you have the correct tools, such as a soldering iron.
The light of menu did not open when i connected the stick with my computer, anyone knows what wrong about that?
It's not for pc.
Will this work with X-Plane on a Mac?
Hi David, yes, it works well on a Mac in X-Plane. And if you intend to purchase the saitek pro flight switch panel that too will work, but you will have to download a plugin Sandy Barbour's xpluginsdk.org
Do these pedals have a center detent?
I don't know about a "detent"; they self center, and that big dial in the center is the spring tension adjustment.
How is the construction on these? Im looking for some with mostly metal parts; these look more metallic than the regular saitek rudders. Is that true?
No. This is made up of very sturdy plastic. The construction is solid and I believe it will last a very long time. The metallic part that you see is thin cover over the top center part of the rudder used as a cosmetic enhancement.
because there are several prices of the same product of the I besiege amazon for this product? Is there some difference among them?
...not that I know, I got the cheapest from a trusted seller and no problem so far. I've bought only one therefore I can't really compare. Mine work just fine.
What is the difference between Saitek Pro Flight Rudder Pedals and Saitek Pro Cessna Rudder Pedals?
I fly a Cessna 172 and the Pro Cessna Pedals replicate the actual pedals in the plane. As far as functionality I doubt if there is any difference but I can't say for sure. The Pro Flight Pedals look to have more adjustments.
Purchasing for XPlane 10 PC Win7 64bit. I saw older new Saitek rudder pedals on this site for much less money. Which one should I buy for xPlane 10?
They will work with XPlane 10 (PC/Mac) the only real difference is the pedals in this model are fashioned and licensed by Cessna. If you're never going to fly a real Cessna (150/172/182) then there's no reason to go for these if the others are cheaper, the licensing is what brings up the price. They are essentially the same thing. I bought them to have the same 'feel' as when I went flying. but other than that there's no real reason not to go with the other Saitek brand pedals (if it's the ones I am thinking of).
is this product in spanish language?
No everything on the unit itself and the paperwork that I have is printed in English.
Is it compatible with Mac?
Yes; I got for it for use with X-Plane 10 on a MacBook Pro Retina running Mavericks.
Are the dimensions stated in the product information for both the Yoke and the throttle put side by side? They say 18.8 x 8.5 x 15.7 inches (for the Saitek CES432100002/02/1 Pro Flight Cessna Yoke System). I would like to get a small table (Width: 27...
Hi Tom, You can actually put your trim wheel below the TPM quadrant (it is actually more similar to how it is located in real C-172). Anyway, 27 1/2" should be enough to accommodate everything. However, make sure that the table is heavy enough. You do not want your display to drop on you when you are doing stalls ;-)
What is the purpose of the mode switch? Is it simply to assign functions to/for different games?
I use it for switching view modes in FSX (virtual cockpit / 2-d panel / outside)
Will it work with Windows 8?
NO PROBLEM! Though on a side note, I have had better luck using the windows update drivers for these things than the provided software. fwiw
Does it work on a MacBookPro? I called Madcatz and they said NO. Do you need to use Parallels so Windows can be installed?
Not sure about MBP, however I do have Win 7 with FSX installed on my Early 2013 iMac via bootcamp. Everything works great.
Is this compatible with windows 8?
yes. Works very well.
I am new to flight sim and I just got the FSX. Is there an option for a mobile stand I could use for the yoke, throttle and rudder pedals? I use a Wheel Stand Pro for my Logitech G27 for car racing sim and I am looking for something similar and I...
I don't know, Tom K. My controls are mounted on the computer table.
Can you trim the plane with this product or do you need the trim wheel and can you use a rutter function without buying the peddles
The Yoke has multiple thumb rocker switches. One of those could certainly be mapped to "trim up" and "trim down", but it's push button trim and not a continuous function like a wheel. There's nothing that would logically or even remotely map to a rudder function.
Hi does the yoke comes with the power cable or ti's sold apart
I doesnt use a power cable. Just a USB included
Does it have changing resistance/ different feel based on airspeed in order to mimic the pressure required to apply control inputs in a real aircraft.
The answer is nope it does not change the feel on the yoke based on airspeed. I found it great and it help me a lot in my training but is not the same as real flying, but pretty close.
will this work on windows 7.1
I have played it on Win 7, and on Win 8.1, so I'm sure it will work for you. Have fun.

It should. I think it's not said to be able to work on Windows 7, but it does.

does it play pitch?
I don't know what pitch is.I was so disgusted with the Encore /Hoyle that I threw it in the trash after a few hours. I purchased Warfield's Pretty Good solitaire. Love it. Amazon has it. Hundreds of solitaire games! Just the card games. No characters to create. Just play cards! You have many choices as to how to move your cards. You can Drag them or right click to play the cards and It will make the move for you . If you right click and it were to ever place a card in a place other than where you meant - just undo. Undo and redo any move as many times as you want. There is a game called pitchfork in pretty good solitaire. never played it. Oh, and you can create your own solitaire games with the product. I am not that advanced.

Do you have to have the DVD in the drive in order to play the games, or can you download everything on to the computer?
For this particular package you can download the disc/games to your computer.. HOWEVER, I also purchased the next package: WMS Slots Zeus II and on that one the disc has to be in the drive at all times to work.....I tried reinstalling it several times to no avil - it was just produced differently... But again, on Reel 'em in, once you've installed from the disc, you're good to go.. Hope this helped & have fun :)
So this game does not work on Windows 8, I presume?
Sorry, I can't answer that. I have Windows Vista and it works fine on my PC. Good luck!
How well does it play on windows 7?
It plays well. I have not had any problems.
I'm Looking For Life Of Luxury made by WMS , is it available on PC or Mac ? Thanks you
Hi Danny I have not seen any as of yet jeannie
Do you need an internet connection to play this game?
You need to install it but no I do not use the cd. I play it without being on the internet. It puts a i con up and you go to it and it comes up for you to play.
Does this play on my ipad
ipads run on iOS operating system (like iphones). The system requirement printed on the box is Windows (XP, Vista, 7, or higher
Will this run on Windows 8. This was asked before but never really answered.
yes, but you must be connected to internet. It will not load on a computer not connected. A little hard to install but if you follow the instructions carefully it will install.
does anyone know if my favorite "Hexbreaker" is on any of these CDs?
Not on this game.
Do you make this for Mac, or only PC?
This game is make for both computers
What else is included on this DVD...possibly Money to Burn? I can't find the complete list
There is no complete list on this DVD. Instead you have make enough money in one slot in order to purchase another slot so that's how you will see the other games

nahh these are not wireless it all depends on what ur looking for if ur a hardcore gamer then sure i would buy them turtles beaches are top nothc headphones the only thing keeping them from being the is that they are made with cheap plastic even the expensive ones
WoW: Will these work(voice activated) with World Of Warcraft?
why not just buy the z6A, same thing and cheaper.
Has anyone ever had an issue with the amBX control panel not adding software automatically?
Yes mine dosnt, I have to manuelly add everything.
What tricks did you use to get this to install on your computer? I had them running on windows 8 but had to wipe my comp. Now no luck.
all I did was install the drivers that came with it .I have installed on 2 different pc's both with windows 7 I have only had problems with getting them to work with music ..I have 2 sets of them on same pc and like i said had zero install issues
I bought one but the software can not run correctly. It doesnt work now. Where can I get help? I have visited the website of mad catz and ambx
Well.... Chances are it could Just be broken? One of mine broke, at first I thought it was just a software problem but eventfully determined it was faulty hardware, I returned them and got my my money back! Shortly after I discovered the adalight mod, in in love with it, recommend 100% worth the hard work
I've read a review that states these will not work "out of the box" of you are using the HDMI output on your 360. Can anyone else testify to this?
It does work out of the box. Please vierw this link to the set-up diagram to see how: http://www.turtlebeach.com/assets/products/54/XL1_howWorks.jpg
can I use on mac?
I honestly don't know but I would imagine so
can i use this om ps3
Im not sure dude I have an Xbox 360. but if it has the single connection on the controller id imagine so please don't take my word for it thats just a guess I hope I helped u out
there seems to be a static sound when using this, does anyone else have this issue?
yes i do
can theses be used on a pc
I have no clue. Havent tried it. my son used it for xbox.
Can these be used with a Ps3?
I don't know but when mine showed up they had bare wire showing so I don't recommend buying this
Can you watch netflix with these
Yes
Is this also compatible with PC?
Most turtle beaches work with pc and consoles
can these be used with an Xbox one?
Yes ,but u need a dss converter. I use it on my xbox 360,xbox one and ps3
if u buy the headset do u need to get an adapter or something im not sure
No. Don't need anything else.
Would this be a useful headset for other PC applications, specifically Skype?
Yes, you can use it on your PC and Skype.
Are these headphones wireless?
Diane, no they are not. I specifically bought them for that reason because I have heard from owners of wireless headphones that the battery does not last that long and in order to keep using them after the battery dies, you have to buy another battery (which aren't cheap). Hope this helped.
Do I need to buy a audio RCA cable
If you want to simultaneously hear game sounds and people talking to you at the same time for consoles, then yes. On PC, no.
Are the cups on this headset circumaural (fit around the ears) or do they lay on the ears?
For me personally they fit around my ears. The inside cavities (the inside part with the logo on them, not the cushions themselves) are approximately 3 inches high and 2 inches wide, if that helps.
What is in the box and will I need anything else for these to work with an Xbox 360 Slim?
Works perfectly with xbox. You get all the cables you need
would I need to by an audio adapter for this headset or just plug in and its ready to go out of the box?
Depends on your tv. if you have an old regular tv, no. However, if you an flat screen, most likely not. If it has an audio in or out (red and white slots) then no. However, you need it if you use an HDMI for xbox because the standard A/V cable that comes with xbox 360 blocks the HDMI slot which you are trying to use. Look it up on You-Tube, which you can still use a alternative cheap way of fixing that. However, I myself bought the adapter because I felt like to, I didn't need it, but did. You can buy the cheap one or the Turtle Beaches adapter, both do the same job.
can i use this on pc and does it have voice changing and if it does't can you tell me a download that i can use to use voice chanigng
You can use the x12 on a pc...it does not have voice changing capability.
Do these plug into the 360 controller or into the xbox 360 itself?
It plugs into both the Controller and the Xbox these Headphones have a lot of wires but for the price and sound quality they are hard to beat,As long as you don't mind a lot of wires.
Are these very comfortable?
I have 2 teenage sons who say they are very comfortable, unfortunately the mic went out on them after about 10 months so they no longer use them.
If I buy this product itself do I need anything else to buy for it to work?
No but I have had a lot of problems with them.

Will this work for multi-player? Could I connect two wireless controllers to this one adapter?
I believe it will work for up to four, although I've only had two connected personally.
Does this include a disc needed to be used?
it does but I suggest you download the official microsoft xbox accessories drivers you will need to manually select the driver either way but the official download is more reliable than the ones on the disc
does this work with amazon tv
no
Will this work plugged in to the Xbox one, to be able to use say the Racing wheel from a xbox 360
This should work with anything that connects to a regular XBOX 360. You might have to do some extra setup to configure the racing wheel 100% correctly, but as far as I know racing wheels are just slightly differently setup XInput controllers. Best of luck :)
is the one that can work with the Xbox One as well??
If you're looking for an adapter for your PC that will connect an Xbox One controller to your PC, you may be able to already connect it using a USB adapter made for the controller. I don't know much about the Xbox One controller and its properties but do some research before you start spending your money.
Will it work with Fire TV?
has to be used with pc.
Is this compatible with IMAC ?
Sure is!
I currently have the software downloaded on my Windows 8.1 64bit (in windows 7 compatibility mode), will this work?
Yes but you have to follow the other ppls directions. I have Windows 8 and I had to go to properties and assign the xbox property to it for it work correctly
will this work on a mac OS i want to use with steam/ GMOD?
To be perfectly honest, I don't think this KIRFy thing will ever play nice with OSX. After trying three or four different mapping programs to get me some TF2 on my new Mac, I ended up just throwing boot camp with windows 7 on it and playing everything from there. It's not my ideal solution, but I just didn't feel like it was worth any more of my time to try and to get it working properly with all of that Cupertino wizardry.
Will this controller work for windows 8?
Yes, it works great!
anyone happen to know if this remote works with windows media center?
Yes. It works. I haven't tried to see how much of it works but I've used it on my Intel NUC before
When playing Recorded TV, how do you stop playing? The old remote had a "Stop" button it seems to be MIA.
Press the play/pause-symbols button to stop (pause) the recording playback; press the back button to return to the Recorded TV screen, and back again to return to the main media center screen.
Is this a Genuine Microsoft product or is it a compatible/OEM/chinese knock-off product?
It's Microsoft, has all the certified seals.
How does it communicate with the XBOX 360? Is it IR, RF, or Bluetooth? I need to know because my XBOX is kept in a component rack.
IR
Does this remote only control volume and power on a TV, or can it be used like any universal remote and change the channel, as well?
It controls our whole tv once we programmed it to the tv. Which wasn't too difficult. I don't even use my tv remote any more, I just use this one.
Using for Netflix and Hulu, can thus be used to navigate from the dashboard to the apps and control the apps as well?
Yes. If I'm not paying a game on the Xbox, I'm using this remote to navigate just for convenience. If you can get around with the cursor you can do it with the remote.
Can you set the volume button to control your surround sound? Also can this turn on/off your surround sound box?
No. It only controls the Xbox or the TV. No audio controls unless it is on the TV.
does it works on DVR?
From what I see on the box that would be a no. Thank you and have a great day.
Does it work with XBOX ONE aswell ?
Technically no, because XBOX One doesn't have Windows Media Center Extender. However, I would assume the power, A/B/X/Y, etc. buttons would work.
Do we need to buy a "joystick" type device to play or just use the mouse?
A mouse is fine
Is there a list of what type of game each game is. ie which are hidden objects, which are puzzles etc. etc.
There is no printed list on the inside. Only on the back of the box do you see some pictures with no names in 4 of the categories. In hidden games you see 2 names. Many of the games are for children. One thing I did not like in several games I could not get to exit and had to shut down the computer.
I'd love to buy some games to play when I'm away and don't have a computer. I do have an RCA DVD player/. would this be good for this also? ty lots
Hi Flo, No, unfortunately this would not work for you. You must have at least a net book that can attach to a dvd drive. As it does take up memory, I would advise using only with a laptop or desktop. If you have a tablet Amazon and Google Play both have lots of great free games I have found. It makes a great substitute when traveling light. ;) Good Luck!
I bought Play 101 Games for an XP op sys. Does anyone know whether they will work on Windows 8? Box only says 7, XP &amp; Vista.
Yes, but for some games you have to use the compatibility feature. Super easy takes about 3 minutes or less.
i have a older computer windows xp professional 2002 series i think no internet so will it work on that
Yes. My computer is very old and no internet and it works well
Does this game have solitaire?
I don't know because I couldn't get the game to load on my computer.
It is only in English? I would like to get it for my mother in law who does not know any English.
I dont know but you can figure most of the games without needing instructions.
My Windows says it's Windows 7 Ultimate. Will it play well on my computer?
The games work just fine on my computer which has Windows 7.
will this work on win 8.1 64bit
Yes. It plays on my Windows 8.1 64 bit machine.
Do games play offline, or do I have to be online to play? Will they work with Win Vista Home Premium 64-bit edition?
all these games play off line, no need to be on the 'net. i can only assume the games will work with Vista Home Premium. the bit edition makes no difference, as long as other games play on your computer. hope this answers your questions. i believe this will be a good group of games for you.
This is just a pop into the disc drive and play version of Assassin's Creed, right? No set-up crap?
No, you have to install the game on your computer it requires a certain amount of space on your hard drive ..see product for details on that. That's how computer games work. If you want a pop it in and play version , look for it on Xbox
Is this the Director's cut and Deluxe Editions?
As far as I know after looking at the packaging and the discs themselves they are just the standard retail releases. Also If you buy this make sure to try and install the second game when the collection arrives because my Assassins Creed 2 disc wouldn't even install or autorun and its been an issue many others have had.
Am I able to use a keyboard and mouse to play or do i specifically need an Xbox controller that plugs into the USB port
I don't have an Xbox so I don't know about using the controllers, but you can play fine with just the keyboard and mouse!
I see the package is wider than usual, is there 2 different cases for ac1 &amp; ac2 or 1 case with 2 cd inside?
mine was 1 for both
can you use digitec controler?
No
Can someone post the minimum and recommended system requirements? Can believe AMZ doesn't have that posted.
If you go here http://www.game-debate.com/games/index.php?g_id=18&game=Assassins%20Creed you can find the information you need. There is also a calculator that allows you to enter your PC info into and the result is your custom answer.
my vedio card is ATI Radeon HD 8970M,is that fine to play?
Yes
Will this work on Windows 8 and 8.1?
Yes it works on my windows on my windows 8 laptop
Will the keys activate on steam?
I have no idea. I bought the physical copy and it is not linked to Steam, but another program called "Uplay". It wanted the key codes entered there. And in my review I mentioned that I only received one key code instead of two.
Will this run on windows 8.1?
Yeah, it worked for me!
What if the adapter break.
Then you should probably buy a new adapter.
will this work if i keep the power brick itself
That I'm not sure of. I just ordered the correct power supply from Microsoft. Amazon does have one though. I believe it called the, E-model power suppy. Hope it works for you.
does it come with all the cords?
It comes with everything that is in the picture
did it take a long time for it to get here?
Heavens no. 3-5 days. Or, 1-2 days. Depending the shipping rate you choose.
Does it come with all the parts to plug into the wall and the xbox?? Like does it come with the part that plugs into the xbox to the brick then from the brick to the wall??
yes it do
will this work with this xbox? link: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0...
The box says "for use with X-SLIM" Not sure if your X-Box is considered slim or not. Mine is also black. Don
Does it come with the cord that plugs into the wall?
No
Will this work for european plugs?
I dont believe so but u can get an adapter for pretty cheap.
will this work for a360 xbox 4g
I have the 4 GB I bought this and it didn't work out of the package so i had to send it back there is another one sold by the same person its 4star rated but its like 10 bucks more way better choice for the 4 gb
I ordered this product and only received the cord that plugs into the wall, should I be expecting the brick, or is that not part of this purchase?
I received brick and the cord, so I think you're missing a part.
wil these game work in my playstation
Yes, the ps3 does not have a region lock like the ps2
What modes does this game have?
It has a kind of bracketed 'story' mode which lets you choose which mission you want to do next based on difficulty and what suits you will face and unlock bonus missions based on which end boss you fight or the scores on the missions, and a 2 player mode of the same thing but with well, 2 of you instead of a computer ally, and I think there is a vs mode for you and your friends, I havnt tried that one yet, but the menu is easy to navigate even if you dont read japanese and the gameplay is kind lf addicting but somewhat repetitive, but I reccomend buying it if your a fan of gundam you will love it.
Does this game support English (Menu)?
It has an English menu like Atase mode online mode off line mode but it is in the right handed corner of the game to select the mode press the circle button. The game has a few English sentences and words but the controls you have to look them up I highly recommend that. Don't just wing it, I did that and I lost so many battles.
I HAVE XP400 IS THIS COMPATIBLE
Yes, I've used it with the XP400 and it does work. It seems to be a simple bluetooth connector and not model-specific.
Has anyone got this to work with the Turtle Beach PX4?
It's a Bluetooth transmitter. YES, it will work!
Hi, does that bluetooth work for ear force delta?
It works with my Deltas and my Tangos with no problems.
IS XP500 THIS COMPATIBLE
As long as the xp500 can sync to a bluetooth source yes,
Can this work on px4
No. This is meant for the Xbox 360's controller, so you can't plug it into the Playstation DS4.
Is this battery powered? Does it have a replaceable or rechargeable battery if it dies? Or is it powered by the xbox 360 controller?
It's powered by the 360 controller.
Is there a mute button on this or do I have to use the one on my headphones?
This device only connects the Headphone to the Xbox controller through bluetooth. Most of TB's headsets have a mute button. Hope it helps.
This doesnt work on xbox one right?
No. But I thought the X1 had Bluetooth support?
Will this make my sons current Bluetooth earpiece for Xbox 360 work with Xbox one?
That wont even fit properly into the controller. I have both systems, and sure wish it worked that way! The connections on the bottom of the remote are very different.
I have Beats Wireless bluetooth headphones. With this device, will they output in-game sound and also allow me to chat? The Beats have a microphone.
Chat only. No game sound.
DPI?
5700 if I remember correctly.
Does it work out of the box with GNU/Linux, so that left,middle,right clicks are all recognized without hassling with a special driver, in X11?
my husband has no issues using it with ubuntu 12.4 and 13.10 he said
What is the actual size of the mouse?
About 5 inches by 3.5 inches it fits very comfortable in the hand because of its unique wave design.
What are the difference between this one and the Steelseries Sensei RAW Mouse?. and is this an optical or laser mouse? Thanks.
I have not used the raw version but honestly it doesn't look like there is a difference at all other than the aesthetician Diablo 3 logo. The light also slowly pulses. And this Diablo 3 version has the rubberised surface not metal. As for the the latter it uses an optical not laser.
Are there more buttons on the right-hand side of the mouse or just the two on the left that are next to where the thumb rests?
Button list : Left click, Right click, Left side buttons, Right side buttons, Middle click, and Middle button (Middle button makes sensitivity ultra fast) (Both sets of side buttons can be remapped using steel series's software)
My mouse stopped working. How can I return this product and replace it with another ?
Call Amazon if you have had the mouse less than 30 days. If not call steelseries.
Is it fully rubberized? or is it a slippery plastic?
It's lightly coated and doesn't feel slippery at all. It grips fairly well. Only thing I've noticed is that after a few weeks of moderate use, the moisture from my hand has started to fade the design colors a little. Mouse is a beast though.
warranty question?
i'm not in USA and ss' mouse dont have warranty in foreign country.
Is anyone else having an issue where the cursor doesn't react appropriately. it's like going into a "seizure", or something.
I notice that on a different mouse that has a damaged cord, but not with the Diablo mouse. The issue I am having with this mouse is my computer doesn't always register that the mouse is plugged in.
How long is the cord?
approx 6 feet. and very heavy duty braided cable. edit: according to the ad info Cable: 2m (6.5ft), braided
This product has tracking? for Brazil
Yes you will have tracking, but you are responsible for custom fees. Thanks
OK, it's now April 2013 and still no Pandaria-compatible driver. Can we assume support for this mouse has been abandoned?
Might need more information to go on like OS, make and model of your computer, driver version for the steelseries world of warcraft legendary mouse, firmware version (if applicable), and what exactly you can't get the mouse to do. As far as official "support", no Steelseries has not released a driver that is related to the Mists of Pandaria expansion. That being said, all the same functionality I experienced with the Legendary Edition mouse in Cataclysm I am experiencing in Pandaria. So please elaborate?
Mac compatible?
Yes
Does in work for windows 8?
Yes, I have windows 8 and works perfect.
What's the DPI max?
DPI is for your screen. I don't think a mouse has anything to do with DPI (dots per inch).
how long and how heavy is the mouse?
The mouse cord is like any other mouse - good length. The item is not heavy at all.
What is the shipping dimension? Thanks.
Of the BOX? Is 2 1/4 high, 5 3/4 wide, 7 7/8 long. Now as far as SHIPPING dimensions goes, whatever box the seller is going to put it in will depend on them. Cause the shipper I got this from (Amazon) put it in a BIG box with lots of packing material.
Does this work on Windows 8.1?
YES.
Will this mouse work for just everyday computer use? Or is it Just for World of Warcraft?
I use it for both gaming and regular use.
Hello, I wonder if you send this item to Brazil! Thank you very much.
Yes can we ship Brazil, but you maybe responsible for custom fees. Thanks
Is it compatible with the PS4?
NO it is not compatible. PS4 dropped the ball on Bluetooth. Where with ps3 you could basically use any bluetooth Mic/headset. I learned this the hard way after purchasing this. Only good with PS3
Is it compatible with GT6 for Ps3?
Yes it is but it not great quality. Put a few more $$$ and get a better one.
is it compatible with cellphones?
Not sure if it is compatible with cellphones, but the overall quality is not that good... but you get what you pay for
as much as the totally loaded battery lasts
4-5 hrs of game play
how long do u need to charge it as soon as you get it?
Around three hours
Hello. You can hear the audio of the game? or just the audio chat?
Just the chat.
I own EX03. Working, but, the volume is very soft. I can't turn it up enough to hear much. Others have this problem or a solution? TY!
same here low volume, but it works, have you turn your volume up in settings on your playstation? just a thought
can i hook it up to my phone?
Not sure, sorry.
Gioteck EX03 Bluetooth Headset for PS3 can it connect to a android smartphone
Yes it can connect. Can the people hear you when you speak? Not unless you're yelling into it.
i have an older ds and just wanna make sure it would work if seems that it would but just wanna double check before i do
my son uses his on a DS lite
Will it connect to windows 8.1
Yes.
Does this work for 3DS games, or is it just a ARDS that works on the 3DS?
I didn't work on my son's 3DS, so we returned it.
Does this work with pokemon heart gold?
I have not used the codes for the game yet but it shows codes for it. I believe you can enter codes as well. I am using it for Dragon Quest IX right now.
does it work without a computer
Yes, absolutely. You can enter codes manually directly on the DS/DSi system.
Does it work on Pokemon ORAS
No. For that you will need to purchase the powersaves 3DS
Does this work with DSi XL
yes!
does this work for 3ds xl for cheat code?
Yes it does very well worked for game I needed.
So it will work on any ds game that you have or does it just work on top of the Line games?
It works on all ds games. If you want something for 3ds games, get power save. But if it's regular ds games, get this.
can this work for the 2Ds?
Yes, but you will have to download the update from the website so it will work.

Will this work on a computer running windows 8?
Yes, I had Windows 8 and it worked great. Upgraded to 8.1 and still works great.
Does this game have a multiplayer option?
Yes one grandson was in our office on the main computer, and the other grandson was in the living room on his laptop and they were playing together. They did use Steam to do this.
I am thinking of buying the physical copy (since the pc download feature seems unavailable.) If i get the physical copy can i use it on steam?
you have to have "steam" to install the game. You are not suppose to need it after you do. I could not get it to work with internet or with out it. If you purchase it. It takes a great deal of time to install it. Sitting with your computer running. Find a book to read.
Without expansion packs, does this game includethings like greek gods?
no the dlc for game of the year includes new factions such as the Inca and Polynesians and a few more and the explorers map pack
Does the game download from the disk to my PC, or do I have to use Steam? I wont use Steam on my computer.
You have to use Steam to play this game.
Does this come with a online game code?
It does come with a code for the game. And it installs a program where you can play against other people. So I would say yes, the code allows you to play other people online, if that is what you are asking.
Why no mouse after loading?
Don't know for sure. Mine works like a charm. Make sure you have also loaded the associated program "Steam". If you haven't that May have something to do with it.
How do I know which operating platform my PC runs? I don't want to buy the wrong software
If you are running windows, go to the control panel and open. open system. it will tell you what version windows you are running.
I'm worried about disk space. Does it make sense to buy the physical copy, or does all the required software (steam, directx, etc) dismiss this idea?
I am Not sure if I understand the question but I'll try to answer. I use the hard copy to load the game and it also loaded esteem function that allows me to save to the cloud. Once the game was loaded I didn't use the disc anymore.
Does this game come in xbox 360?
TnsDeals - It's PC Game
Is the white or black version glossy? I'd don't like the glossy mice because they tend to build up grime very easily.
The black version is not glossy. It does seem to have a sort of glossy feeling on the sides but even that is not much. So to sum up, it is mostly not glossy.
I'm looking for a mouse with a middle-mouse button that's very easy to press. I heard Kana has a low pressure one. Is it?
I am not exactly sure what "low pressure" means. This one is fairly stiff with a clicky feel, it is rather easy to press. Although much harder than a cheap clicky $5 mouse. I have never laid to much attention as to how clicky those buttons are so I am not very experienced in the field.
Can I use this on a black wooden table without a mousepad? I despise mousepads very much
Yes, you can. But if you want performance, i suggest you buy the steelseries qck pad
its works with MAC/OS?
The hardware itself should work perfectly find. The software I'm not sure but to be honest I never use it
Is this version 1 or version 2?
Version 2
does it have a DPI switch up AND down???
It has one single button which cycles through the three dpi settings. So no it does not have up and down buttons.
does it have a DPI switch up AND down???
Up only
is this the v1 or v2
V1
Does this product contains a promotional code for in-game rewards?
Not that I can recall.
What is the actual length of the mouse?
About 12cm or 4,12 inches
can the left and right side buttons be used to go back and forward on online websites?
Yes it worked
What's the length of the cord?
It's about 6ft.
is this the Kana v2 or v1
Kana v1
Does it have an opening trainer database?
Truthfully this software is so user unfriendly for me that I never did get the hang of it. I bought it to improve my chess game. Spent so much time trying to learn the software there was no time for chess. If you are not a geek you might want to try something else.
Does Fritz have the availability to capture the pgn of a game so that it can be imported into another device?
Yes. Game files and be saved/exported in *.pgn format as well as fritz/chessbase (*.cbh) formats.
Does this work on Windows 8?
Yes, it works just fine on Windows 8.
What is the difference between this, and the less expensive Fritz Chess 13 digital download here http://www.amazon.com/Viva-Media-Frit...
It is a similar difference between buying the home version of software and buying the full-blown professional version possessing greater functionality.
Does it run on Windows XP ?
I don't know, I have windows 7.
Does it work on Windows 64bit?
Yes - I'm running it with 64 bit Windows 7 Professional
Does this include the Deep Fritz multiprocessor engine on it as well?
The program I bought does not include the Deep Fritz multiprocessor engine. I wish I knew where the best place to buy Deep Fritz would be (price-wise, I mean). You could try a site specifically dedicated to this brand of chess programs. If such a site doesn't exist, you could try any number of stores such as Chess House, TheChessStore, etc. I hope this has been helpful to you. Take care. --Mark
Is this compatible with a mac???
only windows, using windows running software on the mac might work.
are the instructional videos on frtz 13 complete, or at least more complete than the miserable video 'snippets' on frtz 11
Snippets. The company that produces Fritz has full instructional videos for download or DVD, but you need to pay for them.
Does it have a opening database or tree for learning more opening and middlegame concepts?
Yes. Full database.
Does &ntilde; key?
Is it a different language lay out? ?
Anybody found solution for sporadic mute/unmute touch interface failure?
Unfortunately I couldn't but I never found my self using that feature anyways, its very easy to just remove the touch pad from inside the keyboard, I love this keyboard but that touchpad was a pain in the butt.
Does the keyboard have red backlight? Is it possible to change the backlight to other colors?
Yes and Yes
pause
Works well. Although mine is a blue key color rather than red. I like the keys to light up for the time I type at night. Hope that helps..
how long is the cable
About 6 ft.
does this work for pc?
I have used this on on PC but only with the Simraceway online racing game. It seems to work really well. It is more or less "plug and play" but I needed to enter the "Settings" menu to set up the control functions. For Simraceway, it is very flexible. You can set the wheel, shifting and pedal control to pretty much any button (or pedal) you want. It does indeed work on PC (running Windows 7).
In order for the foot pedals to work, do you have to play a race car game online?
No. They just need to be plugged in and your game set to steering wheel controls. The instructions are also very good at exposing for to set buttons
Does this work on all xbox 360 racing games?
Yes
does this steering weel and foot pedal work for grand theif auto 5
No
DOES THIS WORK ON XBOX ONE?
No
Can this work with logitech g27 pedals and shift stick? My logitech steering wheel is faulty and it is past the warranty. Im using it for PC playing.
No
does it have F1 gears?
Yes
Does it matter what racing game
No
will it work with farming simulator for the xbox 360
Yes
Does it work with both Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014?
Yes the cable works with both Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014, as I have both on my laptops, I use both since some songs can only be played with Rocksmith, so you will not have any issues using the cable for just Rocksmith, enjoy playing..............
This may be a dumb question but is this is like a legitimate cable for recording guitar on a laptop? Not just for the game but fo recording software?
I tested it on Garageband, Ableton on windows 7 and it gave me Awesome results. Ubisoft made the best of two worlds. A little latency but nothing serious.
Can I use this cable with Xbox One?
Yes
Does it work on Windows 7 OS?
Yea it should work fine, thats what I use.
So, one end is USB and the other end looks too small to plug into my guitar jack. How does this work?
No, it's a standard 6.3mm 1/4" jack connector which works with all the guitar... It should be fine with yours too!
Can this cable be used for software other then Rocksmith/Rocksmith 2014? (like garage band or some other sound recording software)
It works perfectly fine with garage band
These cables are 29$ list direct from ubisoft. Why are they so expensive on amazon, especially if they break so easily?
Supply and demand, really... IWD
Can I use my analog pedals to record and to play the game in my PC?
No, you can't. But you won't be needed it as the game provides you with every effects you need for the songs. Also, you can customize every aspect yourself in the game.
Does it work on Windows 8 laptop?
Yes. It works on Windows 8 and 8.1 operating systems - 32 and 64-bit (laptop or desktop).
Is it works for PS4?
Yes, I use it on rocksmith 2014 on ps4
can you hear game audio on this headset when not playing online?
you can but it is very low audio. i recommend anything other than this headset such as astro, etc.
Can you use this with other games on xbox 360? Or just Modern Warfare 3?
On any 360 game
Where can I get another ear hook for the headset
found them in at least 2 places: Amazon.com on page:
how do you set it up to the xbox 360?
You use the sync button just like a controller
Does this work on the xbox one also?
No.
it says i need to intall the sims 3 platform or gateway before it can install someone please help
That pretty much means you need to have the base game, I believe. The Sims 3 Pets is just an add-on, it isn't the game itself.
In your opinion which expansion pack is better, the Pets or Supernatural. Not looking to buy both so would be helpful to get some opinions
Pets adds in dogs, cats, and horses. Along with ranches, dog Parks, cat Parks. And jobs for the pets. Like working in law enforcement, spiritual hunter. Supernatural adds in vampires (if you don't have nightlife) werewolves, fairy's, witches, plant Sims, and zombies. Along with magic, and other super natural stuff. Also adds the ability to have a lunar phase. I have both and they are quite fun. In the end the decision is yours. But I believe these items are cheaper on origin so you might beable to get both. I can't say that one is better than another. Look into both of them on several sites and see what they include. I know supernatural comes with some plants vs zombies stuff and 500 sim points. And pets comes with something and like 500 Sims points. Oh and they each come with a town.
Is this the one that includes the base game sims 3 and sims 3 pets? I saw a cover just like this but this doesn't say it includes both
No it doesn't have the base game the only ep that come with the base game is the starter pack one that also include late night and a stuff pack
does this download come with the game code/ serial number? i have the base game and have origin.
Yes
does the pc download work on mac computers?
Only if it states for Mac.
will not install
The Origin software that is downloaded when you install your Sims 3 (may be different if you store bought the Sims 3) will automatically download this when you enter in the code provided with your download. If the download did not complete properly or was interrupted you may have to re-download. If you cannot install after double checking your install, contact the seller.
I'm wanting to purchase this for my granddaughter. How many downloads does this give her?
I couldn't get mine to fully download at all. I'd recommend ordering the actual disk or going to a store that would sell the game disk
Is PC Download including Windows 7 for it to work?
I have Windows 7 and it works, if that answers your question. It's phrased a little funny so I'm not too sure what you mean.
i need the product code to activate it so i can play, this is different then the registration one
If I gave you mine would it still work?

Can you plug in just one usb port: Can you use this keyboard with only one USB port?
Yes. The other USB plug is for the pass through USB port on the back of the keyboard.
Does it work with windows 8?
It does work with Windows 8 very well with no problems.
Can you adjust the light intensity and the color? or is it just blue?
The intensity has four different settings: off, dim, medium, and bright. However, the color cannot be adjusted.
Is the wrist rest removable?
Yes. It attaches with screws, but it is shipped detached.
Can the programable keys be used to program windows or windows application short cuts vs just game?
Yes, download the latest drivers and there is an option for it.
Did anyone else NOT receive the wrist rest or additional 1-6 key caps?
The extra keys are in the rest. As well as the key pull it might be the seller you bought from it is supposed to come with the rest
Does it have extra USB port?
There is a peripheral USB port located on the top.
Does it have backlight?
no
Can you use this on an Asus laptop?
Yes, you can.
Is this keyboard compatible with a MAC?
It should be although I'm not sure if the media buttons will work. If you're planning to use the USB port on the keyboard (there is one on the back close to where the cord connects), you'll need 2 USB ports fairly close to eachother on your computer.
Does this keyboard response with Windows 8.1?
I have Win 8.1, and it seems to work fine. I do currently have a problem with incorrect keystrokes registering from the keyboard, as discussed in my review of this keyboard. I don't think this is an incompatibility with Win 8.1, otherwise I would imagine all the keystrokes would be acting up, and not just a few.
k60 keycaps: Does anyone know where I can buy textured keycaps like the ones seen on the k60?
geego octopus keycaps
Which keys are mechanical and which aren't
Only the main keys, arrows, and numpad. Esc, f keys, home group, and print screen ones are not.
Is this keyboard compatible with Windows 8? The Corsair Website says "yes" while the spec information here says "no."
It works with Windows 8 flawlessly. There is custom software/drivers that provide firmware updates that may not be compatible with windows 8 however.
I just got the K60, I plug it in but no lights come on and no plug and play happens? whats the matter
I guess the first question is do you have both plugs for the kb in. If so try plugging them into known working usb ports
compatible with mac?
Yes, it works with Mac. A few of the extra keys do not work, but the standard keyboard works as any other would.
How long is the wire?
Eyeballing it, I'd say 6 feet.
is it a mechanical keyboard
it's not sadly. but it is still a great keyboard rest assured. Mechanicals can get a bit complicated if something goes wrong with it
Is this compatible with windows 8?
I'm not entirely sure, I have windows 7, try and look to see if there a forum for its compatibility
What's the difference between this one and the standard G105 that goes for ~$55? Just a logo and green lighting?
Yes that is correct. Thanks.
is it wireless
no. it is wire..
Is this keyboard mechanical or rubber dome?
It is NOT a mechanical keyboard. The price is the main giveaway on that. The keys feel fine though. I use it more for typing and that works well (I use the Logitech G13 for gaming). So far so good!
does Logitech Gaming Keyboard G105 work with win 8?
Yes- I'm using it with a Lenovo G-series laptop running Windows 8.
is this a mechanical keyboard ?
No, its not.
Has logitech fixed the issues with their G9X mice having a high pitch whine? My last G9X would emit a high pitch noise when it wasn't moving.
I wasn't aware of a high pitch whine with the G9X. Mine works flawlessly thus far.
Is this the same as Logitech G9x Black Two modes scroll USB Wired Laser 5700 dpi Gaming Mouse. My son asked for that for christmas.
Yes it is the same basic mouse, this one just has the "Call of Duty' graphic on the mouse grip and comes with a mouse pad.
does this work with windows 8?
yes, it certainly does. you can just plug it in and use the native windows driver or download and install the Logitech software for it.
does this game have English subtitles or is it only in Japanese
It does have English subtitles.
does this game have English subtitles or is it only in Japanese

Why is this game is this game so horrible
Its ok it depents I rather enjoyed it but I'm also a hardcore aliens fan so I like almost any alienss game but the graphics are kinda crappy the gameplay is kinda like call of duty I would give it 5 out of ten
this game is the spanish ?
This game is TRASH do not waste your money!
Does this game come with the free downloadable code for War for Cybertron as well?
Yes
how many players????!!!!
one player,but has online multi players on live
I've had this talk with my friend and I want to know if it's true, Can Cybertronians literally "feel" pain despite the fact that they are robots?
Yes They Fell Pain Although They Are Robots But The Emotions and The Felling Are Truth and Similar To Our Senses We Humans, i Hope This Answer is Well Convincing You Thank You For You'r Question :).
Does the Matrix of Leadership ever make an appearance, or is it only mentioned in the game?
It's only mentioned. Unlike the first game where the Matrix changes hands into Optimus' for the first time; this game focuses on the actual Fall of their home planet. Optimus stays the Prime and despite not hearing anything about a third game there could easily be one if they feel the need to make it. If your an old fan it will please you with how they molded the story, if a new fan you will love it the same. The biggest suggestion to make for anyone is to search the levels, find the 'Easter Eggs', collectables and just general background details that give a boatload of extra depth to both game stories.
From what I heard, is it true that this game and it's predecessor is part of the G1 canon?
My son who I bought the game for says yes it is part of the G1 Canon
Can you customize characters with out multiplayer
I've not been able to. Unfortunately, I don't think you can.
Is multiplayer 4 player?
The multiplayer is online only. No local split screen.
How much cussing is in the audio? Have young kids around.
I would recommend for children. There is not any cussing and the violence is no more than they would see in "Transformers The Movie", which is carried out in a cartoonish manner with swords and gadgets. Now if they play online that is a different story but even online everyone tends to be respectful because majority of the players are children.
How do you get all three games to download only the Traitor Soul will download?
The other games aren't separate downloads. Just open Traitor Soul, make your character etc.., and then once you start playing you will start out in the Temple of Fate and have the option to go to the town of Grove (Game 1), the outpost of Druantia (Game 2), or the Outpost of Typhon. Unfortunately the Town of Grove isn't exactly like the original Fate (you'll notice the differences in monsters, your pet, merchandise, etc..) which irked me at first, but once you get used to them they're pretty neat.
Does it work on windows 8?
I haven't found any problems w/ playing this game on Windows 8, I have been playing for approx. one month.
Not sure if I want to buy this game. I play all of the "Ages of ...." games. Would this one be as good? I'm not very good at first or second person sv
Fate is more of a diablo clone. point and click with the mouse to do everything.
So I've owned this game for a month and it was working fine until one day it just refused to finish loading and won't work anymore. Any Ideas?
Jonathon, if you know right about when it stopped working, I would run a System Restore back to just before that, maybe a couple of days if there's an entry for that time. It will uninstall programs installed since then, and will also uninstall Windows updates, and I'm pretty sure it takes care of Java updates, if you have that installed (most people do). It won't affect your documents or internet favorites or anything like that. If that doesn't make the game load correctly, I would uninstall and reinstall the game. You can locate your game save folder, and copy the whole thing to your desktop or Documents or whatever. For Windows XP, it's in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\WildTangent\fatethetraitorsoul\Persistent\SAVE, or for Vista and 7: C:\Program Data\WildTangent\fatethetraitorsoul\Persistent\SAVE. These folders will be hidden, so you'll have to set the Explorer window to show hidden and system files. I would just copy the whole SAVE folder, uninstall and reinstall the game, and then start a new game just to make sure the folders get reestablished to start with. Then copy your old SAVE folder onto the new one. I did this moving the game from one computer to another, and it worked fine.
Does this work with an Xbox 360 controller? Or is it strictly Keyboard and Mouse?
This particular one is for PC only. It has to specify for Xbox 360. Hope this helps!
Do you need internet to download this game?
No, thankfully this game was made by people who understand how to distribute games. It comes as a CD but it will install #3 and you will have to choose to play in the #1 or #2 story lines.
could it be used on multiple computers?
Yes. You can install it on as many computers as you want. :) These people actually know how to make a game that's nice to the user.

can you play it offline?
Yes.

Yes it does!
Is this Hard drive compatible with the xbox 360 E model?
If your xbox 360 E is thick version, then this hard drive could be compatible with it.
Do you need a cable to plug it in to the Xbox, or does it plug in directly?
Plugs straight
Dose I fit in the Xbox 360 E E
It fits on the latest xboxes that have the compartment door for HD hope this helps
does this hard drive is compatible with the xbox 360 s console dont know if is first or second generation how do I find out
It fit in my Xbox 360 slim. I don't know which others it's compatible with.
Is this hard drive compatible with the Xbox 360 Original Console?
No it is not compatible with the 1st model xbox 360s not does the xbox 360 elite. Because the hard drive for that console attaches to the top and doesn't have an internal hard drive slot. But the 2nd and 3rd model 360s do because they have internal hard drive slots.
Will this fit XL size?
No. I brought it and it was too small
Will this fit a DSI?
No
Will this work with a DS3 XL?
It is not. For xl
does this cover fit the 3dsxl
No
Does it come with all the av cables and have an easy setup?
Most consoles now days dont use av cables. Mine came with HDMI cable and that was it. If you have wifi its easy to set up too.
Is this XBox 360 compatible with XBox games?
Most games, yes, but the are a good amount that are either non functional, or not fully functional.
Does the console have the cat5 port in addition to wifi connectivity?
Yes
does this include the wireless controller plus 1 month gold card
No
Does it require any thing else to work
I had to buy the battery pack with a cord that plugs into the controller in order for the controller to work. You could also use regular batteries in order to get the controller to work, but I just went with the battery pack with a cord. I bought the battery pack from Gamestop, but I'm sure Wal-Mart or K-Mart have them also. Hope this answers your question.
Does it have the matte finish?
Yes
do all xbox 360 come with wireless controllers, can you use a wired controller
Yes
Is this console European or american?
I believe it's American
have it all cable which connect on tv?
No cables, you can get them from the game store for 20 bucks
Does the Xbox 360 250GB console come with cables? Do I need any adaptors for my old console?
I am not the seller.
I have the non Director's cut. Can I have both on my ps3 at the same time?
Dear Michael, You can but it will be like a copy with extra, the director's cut is for those who hadn't played the game or don't even have it, becasue it only contains the game along with the dlc already installed, soundtrack and the videos. So if you like, you can download the DLC, watch the videos and listen to the soundtrack and by that, it will be like you have the director's cut. I hope this helps you.
There is a big price difference between the directors cut (Being cheaper) then the greatest hits version. Any reason for that?
Heavy Rain: Director's Cut was released as a "complete" version of the game which includes the only piece of downloadable content, The Taxidermist, as well as the game soundtrack, Playstation Move support, eight making-of videos, three dynamic themes, fifteen pieces of concept art, and two bonus trailers. The game is also marked as a Playstation Greatest Hits title, bearing the red box.
Does this game comes with Russian Language? (Not only subs)
Not sure but I only think it has 2 languages
Does this game come brand new, factory-sealed in the plastic?
I bought a fulfilled by Amazon version and it was totally brand new and sealed. It did not include the booklet unfortunately but the game was excellent!
This game have Chinese language or sub?
10 languages offered. However, Subtitle only for chinese is available
the game is in Spanish language?
Yes the game comes in Spanish language but don't know if it's Spain or Latin version, the game also have French
Are the extras all on the disc or is it all downloads?
Never got that far found it boring since game plays it self and you occasionally do something try saints row mature game but excellent fun full package has lots of extras
Are there a lot of complicated button combinations to push? Is this at all similar to Diablo? Apologize for the simple terms. I'm new to the PS3.
You should know your way around the controller for sure but the base of the game is very user friendly and plays more like a movie than a video game. Actually allot of fun for a new gamer.
What is the difference between this and Heavy Rain - Greatest Hits?
The Director's cut have full PS Move support, the Taxidermist DLC, sound track and videos of the making off. Greatest hits don't have any of those.
Dual shock
I can tell you it is a very exciting game, a fancy frame! I highly recommend it!
can I play this on the xbox one?
There is a similar Xbox One title, but the Xbox One does not support use or play Xbox 360 game disks. It also requires a Kinect.
Is this easy for beginners to follow?
I'm a beginner, and found this hard to follow. It's not good about giving you a heads up about what's coming. It also changes moves too quickly in my opinion. By the time I was starting to catch on, it was already six steps into the next dance step. You pretty much have to repeat the song until you had it memorized, or make up your own moves. Haha. Though Zumba fitness had problems, I enjoyed that one much more and went back to it after trying rush out a few days.
does this work in Xbox 360 Kinect NTSC-J model?
I works with any xbox kinect successfully attached to your console
I currently have the Zumba Core DVD, does this DVD (Zumba Rush) have workouts that are different from Zumba Core?
It is so much better since it focus in the whole body and the sessions range are really nice
Does this work on NSTC-J systems?
I don't know but I wouldn't waste my money. You're better off buying a Zumba video without the annoying defective fake "game" function that just distracts you from learning the steps.
Can I play this with my daughter?
Yes. Two player mode
What's the difference between this one and Zumba Fitness Core?
The biggest difference that I noticed is that the songs seem faster paced in Zumba Rush.
Is the game in Spanish?
No, but there are a lot of songs in Spanish on this game.

Led lighting on star wars gaming mouse?
Yes and you can change the color of the light in the settings.
Does the mouse work on a Mac?
It does work on a Mac, but you cannot program it (i.e. change the colors etc). All the buttons work when booted into the Mac in their default states (thumb buttons are the number keys, right/left/center/scroll). You can change the main mouse buttons using the Mac Mouse Preferences. The colored light remains the last color it was set to on Windows. I use it on my Mac all the time.
i travel alot so the magnet paneling on the side falls off alot and i lost it not the symbol but the whole side of the mouse can just fall off......
Call razor you may be able to get a replacement
Does this actually come with a printed code for the crystal?
Honestly I don;t 100% remember since that was some time ago. If I am not mistaken, you had to sign up on the Razer site and then you would get a code.
Anyone get a 12/21 delivery date? Considering that should I really look forward to having this mouse on 12/21?
Any update?
Just to confirm, will this work with the Xbox 360 Arcade console?
Yes. I have an Arcade console, it worked perfectly.
my son had all his data erased after buying this hard drive and the cable accessory. what went wrong? something was unformatted. he has lost 7 years.
Ouch :( I was in a similar position when I moved all my multiplayer saves to my flashdrive to play at friend's, but the files became corrupted after a while. I had thankfully made a backup on my pc 3 months before with Xport 360. So you're saying evrything was moved from the original drive to the new one over the cable but the data wasn't there when you started the 360 with the new drive? Or did Xbox Live apply an update and the data was erased after the update? It might still be there and recoverable, just unrecognized by the 360. First do not pit more stuff on the drive! It increases the chance of any data there previously being overwritten or becoming fragmented! Best to not even turn the 360 on with the drive in. Try using fatx explorer, as it actually has a recovery tool for deleted files. If the 360 redormatted the drive entirely though, your data is gone, as formatting deletes the data and overwrites it with a blank slate.
Will this work on xbox 360 Pro??
If it has a detachable Hard Drive then yes.
Will It work with the Xbox360 Elite Console
Yes it should.
It says 320 GB yet only has 293 GB available, what happened to the other 27 GB?
It is being used for System files on the Xbox. It is the same concept of getting a HDD for a computer where it says (some number) but available is less. The system files used to run your xbox along with any updates, DLC, or games will use this disk space.
Will this play the original XBOX games that are compatible with the XBOX 360?
If you follow the instructions detailed in some of the reviews to "restore partition 2" it will play compatible Xbox games. It's pretty easy to do, you just need to hook the hard drive up to a Windows computer using a transfer cable and follow the instructions.
Which one of these works externally with an xbox 360 FAT (the original 360's)?
This will work with the old 360s.It attaches at the top.
My 320 is showing up as an unformatted USB device. If I format it, does it just become 32gb max? Shouldn't it be formatted right already?
I was lucky enough to get one that has no issues. I just connected it to my xbox 360 and it works like one made by microsoft. Except it will not play original xbox games. Not a problem for me. It is not uncommon that defective units slip through quality control and my guess is that you might have one. I suggest return it for exchange because Amazon has excellent customer service. I hope this was helpful. It should already be formatted and ready to go. Good luck. Thanks for asking.
is this internal or external
External.
I keep reading reviews about not working with "original title games", what does that mean? If I don't have any games over 3 yrs old will this work?
I have had this for about 4 and never had an issue years i think and never had an issue with single game. I would say i have played a good 30 games on that hard drive with no issue.
Can I play a previous save from the original Fallout New Vegas or will I have to start over from the beginning?
You can most definitely use your old saves, the only difference between this game and the original release is that the DLC is included. The rest is the same. Hope this helps! :)
Are you required to install disc 2 dlc before playing disc 1? I wanted to play the game without the dlc prior to installing it.
No you do not just put in the game and play at any time you can install the dlc. I know because this is my 2nd copy of the game. I got halfway through the story and this was on sale so i bought it and installed, it works fine and I enjoy me Dlcs
If you buy used can you still install the dlc from the second disc?
Most definitely! The install disc can be used on multiple consoles and as many times as you need it.
Are the missions like Call of Duty (mission 1 must be completed before mission 2) or like Far Cry (you can complete missions in different order)?
It's like far cry
Do i need a Microsoft HDD to install this or can I install to the flash drives I use for extra storage?
Its best to install it on the hard drive
Is this version more, or less buggy then the regular edition? Less crash/freeze prone?
I've never played on the regular version, this is the only one I've played
Which one is better fallout 3 or new Vegas
New vegas by far!!
The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?
Some of that edition did technically have Spanish. But I think a manual work-around is: Games Library--&gt; (rt-clk) to fallout new vegas in list--&gt; Properties --&gt; Language Tab
how different is this from fallout 3? I never completed FO3 but enjoyed the atmosphere and the idea that it starts you as a child.
FONV is similar to FO3 in concept. FONV is different in that it dumps you right into the action with more creatures and gangs. As with FO3 it has several DLCs too. The graphics are slightly improved. Of course the setting is pretty cool. Please do finish FO3, good fun.
Can you transfer your progress on the original fallout new vegas game to this new game?
Yes, the ultimate edition has the original game plus a 2nd disc with all the dlc for you to download. You would be able to use the content from the original game and not lose it.
is this all I need to hook it to my tv and play wii bowling
Yes. We have Wii sports and it consists of bowling.
I want to download the old Zelda, Kid Icarus, Mario Brothers, etc. Will this version support it? I can't seem to figure out the size of the hard disk.
This will support the Virtual Console of the old Zelda, Kid Icarus and Mario Brothers. If you are talking about using old NES cartridges with the Wii, that will not work. Hope this helps!
We just bought Skylanders SWAP Force and it completely killed out 7 year old Wii console. Is this Wii capable of reading the dual layered discs?
Well Your Wii Was Old and I Have a Blue Wii I Bought This Year it Still Works Great and i am Not Sure if Your Wii Can Play Dual Layer Discs.
What is included in the Skylanders starter pack?
I received the the wii which was fine but did not receive the Skylander game. I was dissappointed about that but when I read the fine print it did state the game was not included. I should have paid closer attention.
Will this work with Wii fit?
Absolutely (I think my daughter has played most of her games on it). This is a Wii through and through, just like the original ones produced many years ago. It just happens to be blue. The mini one, the red one, I wouldn't trust with my stock.
Can this version play dvds?
NO,this version does not play dvds.
If your internet is down can you still watch netflix on the wii?
No, in order for Netflix to operate, you will need to be connected to the internet.
Are the Zumba games with the Zumba belt compatible with this console?
I don't know, but I don't see why not. I think all you need is the belt and the sensor.
Can you connect 4 star matt packs to play a dance game for the wii
If it's a wii game and wii accessories you should have no problem.
can this Wii be used internationally or are there special adapters I need?
I have taken mine overseas, you just need a power cable for your specific country with the correct voltage. If you check the back of the machine, it supports 100-240. Do not plug in your 110 cable in a 240 volt country and vice versa!
this version is censored?? thanks
No, it's not censored. At least, being half way through I have not seen a censored screen. All the probing is there. I think only EU, AU, and Africa are censored.
Does this game contain a printed manual? Does it have any insert in the box?
It doesn't come with a manual. You learn everything you need to know to play the game while playing. (there might be a digital manual on the disc) It does come with a code insert for extra outfits.
It comes in Spanish version?
There aren't any spoken languages besides english, but it has subtitles.
I have a PS4, How can I play this game?
This is a PS3 game, so far the PS4 is not backwards compatible for previous console games.
Is the case red or white?
Red
Is this the "greatest hits" edition?
Yes it us.
Hello, is in the game German Subtitle available ?
I have not checked, but normally they are included. According to my information: Features Menus and Interface in - English, Francais, Espanol, Deutsch, Portugues and Italiano Features Subtitles in - English, Francais, Espanol, Deutsch, Portugues and Italiano Features Voice overs in - English Like I'm French, I confirm the support of the French language in menus and subtitles
Has multilanguage? Thank u!
I can't find any option to change the language.
Can kids play this game or not ?
It is rated M (ie for adults) for its content. If you allow your kids to watch the TV show, you'll find the equivalent level of content (language, ethnic jokes, etc.). The violence level is on par with what you see in the show as well. It is definitely not meant for kids, but it is really up to what you're comfortable with.
Any different if i buy a used or new one?
No and yes..No because it's same game . yes because you know when something is new when used it can be buyers beware.
Is the item durable?
The wheel is very solid. When you feel it you know it will last for a really long time. I use mine all the time and have had no issues at all with anything breaking or even showing signs of wear. It is a well built piece.
How does this thing steer? does it attach to something or does it use an accelerometer? and will it work with most racing games?
It uses an accelerometer, but I've seen setups where people attached it to the column of other steering wheels. The accelerometer is alright, in my opinion. It's not a high end wheel since no feedback, but it's nicer to use than a gamepad, or worse, mouse and keyboard. As for games, I tried it out with F1 2013, F1 2014, TDU2, Race 07, GTR Evolution, and DiRT 3, and they all worked fine after setting the controls to what I wanted.
Will that work well for flying games?
no it won't. I'm sorry
Does this wheel need to be attached to some other unit? Or is what is advertised here all that is needed?
It works with accelerometers, so you don't need to attach it to anything at all, unless you want to.
Does the thing register with games as xbox360 as my logitech f310 gamepad does? Because msot new games need that to work ingame
not all games this control is more used for simulator race games as iraceing and simraceway.
Does this work with Asphalt 7 and 8?
No.
Will this work for non-racing-sim games, like Euro Truck Simulator 2?
Yes it will I use it for that game regularly.
Can I be able to attach this to my G27, I know that the buttons wont work, but is it attachable?
Not easily. You can fabricate a mod to the G27 (youtube for specific directions). There is a mounting screw in the back of the SRW-S1 if you want to build your own mount for it.
Does it work on the iMac? I want something to use with F1 2013 My PC flight yoke works for steering, but I also need analog gas/brake.
I actually have a Mac, but it works as a standard device (it's kind of crappy actually on it), I don't own F1 2013 on MAC (i do on Windows). But I would recommend you to launch BootCam and run this wheel on Windows natively, if you can.
Does it work with any driving or racing game, even simulators?
Yes, I have used with iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Need for Speed Shift 2, and Game Stockcar 2013. It works well but without FFB (force feedback). By comparison, in iRacing, I tend to be about 1-2 seconds slower per lap than I am with my Fanatec ClubSport Wheel and Pedals. However, I am certain that I could close that gap to less than 1 second with more practice.
why does it say that maintains the charge for up yo 1 year? it wont work after 1 year?
If you charge it, it will stay charged up to 1 year not that it will only work for a year.
Will this work with the new vita to be released on may 6th?
It will charge the Vita 2000, however you will need the USB cable from the original Vita 1000 kit to charge the battery. You should be able to buy the original Vita USB cable separately here on Amazon.
Can I charge the charger itself using iPad adapter (any other USB power supply) or Vita adapter only?
What was previously stated, only can be charged using the vita charger. But it does hold a very large charge and can be used to charge any USB device.
So I realized that this is an european model, so can I still charge it using my american vita ac adapter? or do I need to get a converter?
Yes you can. I bought this myself.
where is the other cable for the portable charger
It didn't come with a cable
What are the dimensions?
The battery pack itself is 2 5/8" x 2 5/8" x 7/8", I just measured it now.
Can this be used to charge other devices via USB?
absolutely! Just check The needed voltage and the charger's maximum. But it will work with almost everything
Can't charge this because I have a vita 2000 and had to buy a separate cable for it. Does anyone know a way to make it charge?
the ac charger that comes with the original ps vita will charge the portable charger.
can i charge my samsung galaxy tab 2 with this portable charger? i have a ps vita too, but i would like to know if i can use it with my tablet and my iphone 5.
I have charged my galaxy tab 3, Note 2 , Ipad 4 and ps4 controller with this
I use the AC adapter to charge it, but now six hours passed and the button with the red light keeps blinking. Is it normal?
No
does the game have 2 player offline mode?
Yes. It is a split screen (top bottom).
What's the difference between the GT 5 and this GT 5 XL? Why not buy the GT6? ( I would like to purchase for my husband, the one who plays)
GT5 XL adds a few special downloadable cars/tracks etc. GT5 is the full game, but the XL version includes content that came out after the initial release of GT5. If you bought GT5 and wanted the extra cars, you'd have to pay to download them. GT6 has a different interface, but many reviews said that GT5 was the purer game. Read some reviews on GT6 and GT5 to see what you think.
In the disc of PS3 says BLUS OR BCUs? have this option for spanish language?
Says BCUS and it does have the Spanish language option.
This game is multiplayer?
I do not play online but offline yes 2 people can race against each other but you have to be in arcade mode. one thing I do not like is in my game the regular version when you tune your car's power and race against your buddies your car automatically goes back to the stock power of when you got it. but do not worry just in arcade mode but in this version when you upgrade your cars and race against your friends I believe my brother said the powers the same. he gots this extended edition
DOES PS3 GRAN TURISMO 5 PLAY WELL ON A PS4?
No
Can this game be played without the steering wheel?
Yes it can.
Can two players drive at same time?
No
Can you use the PS move racing wheel accessories with this game or any racing game?
Yes
Is this compatible to the racing wheel controller?
Yes I believe it can. Old game still a great one!!
GT5 is supported by Logitech Driving wheel, does that mean this edition also supports that wheel??
Yes
does the game have 2 player offline mode?
Yes. It is a split screen (top bottom).

Can I add PC version to Steam?
Yes that's what I did. Whenever you install the disc, the game will add to your steam account.
why is the pc version $18 and the download $39????
Not sure about the price difference, I myself was confused. However, I bought the PC version and waited a few days for it to ship to me. The CD key from the physical PC version will unlock the game on Steam for digital download. You should then have permanent access to it on Steam forever. Basically, if you can wait a few days definitely order the PC version and save some bones.
DVD vs Download difference? Since they both use Steam, is there really any difference? Does the DVD still download from Steam to install?
I don't think there is any game-play difference. Some people like to own the box art but generally just buying it on Steam is faster.
Do you need internet when using this game?
No, it loads something called "Steam" but the game installs on your PC and runs without being online.
Do you need internet when using this game?
Nope.
If I buy the download version would I be able to play? Reason I'm asking its because I'm in Japan, and I cannot buy it from Steam. Thank you
Im guessing yes, because it will be on your computer and not from a pc disk, i dont think it will require Steam. Worth a shot?
Are the controls for the PC version easy to use?
Yes. controls are the mouse, the space bar, and keys s, d, f, e, and g.
Does the boxed version include a map like the collector's edition?
No
Can it run on any version of Windows after Windows 2000?
I ran it on XP and Windows 7
Can it run on windows 8?
I run it on Windows 8.1 pro with no issues!
Can you play as the ogre on this one?
Yes. Ogre is playable when you start the game.
Do you need the code to play multiplayer online?
Yes, it comes with it.
Do I need a specific code to play this online? I just bought this used.
I bought it used...if bought used I think you need to pay to get the new code..so yes you do need a code.
May I ask if this is an ENG ver. game? =)
Yes, it is
Does this game offer anything to single players/non-online gamers?
Besides character customization and fight lab i don't think there's something more offered in the game. Over 50 characters to play with in story and arcade mode i guess
How many "REAL" buttons? How many buttons from this will register in my other games without using a different program?
Windows will only recognize 5 buttons. The others you'd have to program in the mouse software to duplicate keyboard keys, like F1 to F12. This is true for all the mmo mice with lots of buttons. In addition, you can program macros to each button. For example, you could program one of the mmo7 buttons to simultaneously click on the target and activate a keypress like F12 (then bind "grenade throw" to F12 in the game), and voila, you have a mouse-over-target single-click grenade throw. Again, you can do the same thing with most high-end gaming/mmo mice.
Does it have on-board memory for the profiles? I currently have a G700 and this feature has almost become a requirement for me (Plug 'N Play).
No it doesn't. I just put everything on a USB drive, drivers, profile editor and profiles. A little more of an inconvenience but for me having a mouse fully adjusted and customized to my hand makes up for it.
Are the measurements listed for the mouse or mouse package?
There isn't any measurements as far as I can tell, but it does make sense because this mouse is fully customization. It can be very small once everything is retracted, or can be longer when fully extended. It can fit pretty much the average person's hand. People that would have a hard time would be someone who's 6'0 + and have huge hands.
Is the MMO 7 good for FPS/graphic design? I love buttons, but are they freely customizable?
all mouse buttons are configurable to any keystroke.
There doesn't seem to be an option to map mouse keys to launch software? The profile configuration only allows macros and pre-determined hotkeys.
The mouse macro options in the software should allow you to program the buttons to activate keyboard keys, repeat recorded mouse actions, and mouse buttons. To open software, you could record presses involving the windows key, but it cannot natively open software.
It looks like there is a giant screw sticking out the bottom of the mouse that would jam into my wrist if I tried to palm the mouse. Why doesn't it?
due to the way your hand wraps around the mouse, even at rest it never touches it. FYI, that screw is actually the modification tool for the mouse. All of the removable pieces have a hex screw keyed to that same tool, so you can easily change the plates. The palm rest has a small lever on the right side just underneath the shell that when pressed in, allows you to slide that entire plate forward or back so you can find a comfortable setting for your hand. Setting this plate correctly for your hand will also keep you from hitting the tool when its in the mouse.
Does the scroll wheel retain its inertia or click into place (i.e. behave like a flywheel or like the wheel from Wheel of Fortune)?
To put it in the context you suggested, "Wheel of Fortune". It does not retain any real inertia, and basically only moves when you have your finger on it.
Is it good for Large and Wide hands?
yess, it has a plate that you can put on the right side that you can rest all your fingers on, and the pam rest goes out almost liek 2 and a half inches max, but there is also a 2ndary palm rest that is higher up that will fit even larger hands
Does it light up at all?
only the dpi indicator, the mode changing button and the front of the main mouse buttons light up,but there is a gap infron of the buttons, so when the mouse is resting, it looks like a cross of light is projected infront of the mouse on whatever the mouse is resting on
have you been satisfied with this mouse so far, does it hold up?
Mouse holds up just fine. I love all the features and the way onlookers ogle over the mouse. I like the weight of the mouse and it's flexibility. I would suggest however if you have large hands to keep looking. This particular mouse almost fits my hand and I find myself holding it in odd positions that make my hand cramp up after long use. Overall I would give it four and a half out of five stars. Hope this helps.
Is the shipped version English or French ? The photos show the box in French
Mine was in English.
The program comes with the virtual B737 manuals Vol.1, Vol2 and the QRH?
It comes with a manual in PDF form that is 1,000 pages long...lol As for QRH, it's mostly click on buttons/instruments with mouse in the virtual cockpit
is the aerosoft pmdg 737 ngx the same as pmdg 737 ngx
Yes.
Are you able to get the update to the steam edition with the box version of the PMDG?
Yes you most certainly can. You just use the serial number in the box set to download the update. Make sure you buy the box set new not used
Does this stand on its own or is this an addition to Flight simulator X
This is an add on for Flight Simulator X. It is not stand alone.
Does this include the 800/900 and the 600/700 or just the 800/900 ?
Hi Cameron, the 800/900 is the base package. The 600/700 is the add-on for the base package and is purchased separately. However, if you have FS2004 all 4 series are included!
Will this PMDG 737NGX software work with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004?
No, it only works with FSX and must upgrade to service pack 2 (this is downloaded online)
can this be used on fs2004?
The minimum operating system requirements I will state right off the hard copy package I have: "Microsoft Flight Simulator X (SP2) (which is FSX Special Performance 2), Intel Dual Core or similar, Video Card Direct X 9 with 512 MB, with minimum operating system XP/Vista/7, 3 GB free hard disc space, and 2 GB RAM. SHort Answer for FS 2004: No.
will it run on windows 8 or 8.1
I run it on win 7. No lags and other problems.
Does it come with any liveries other than the default shown on the package?
It comes with a pretty decent number of liveries...mostly all of the major airlines from what I recall. If there's one you don't see, you may be able to find it elsewhere online. If you can afford it, I'd also suggest the PMDG 777!!
does it work on windows 8 at all?
Yep. Playing on Windows 8! Brian
Does this include Multiplayer gameplay?
No
Does it come with English for the Nordic Version
Hello Caleb I am sorry but I bought this game for the son of a friend and all he needed was that game in english.
How can I download this on my IMac
No
does it work with logitech driving force pro?
Yes it work perfectly
Can I use a joystick with this game
hi and yes you can with the (logitech G27) joystick
This game compatible by using G27 PC Wheel with H-Shifter 6 speed?
Yes Euro truck simulator 2 is comparable with a G27 steering wheel.
This product compatible by using G27 PC Wheel?
Yes. Everything works well. In the game you can set the transmission style to H-shifter and use the gear shift
Does it works with the white Xbox 360 (non slim)?
Yes it will.. That's what it was made for.
My XBOX 360 Kinect won't connect to the USB port of my Mac. Will this solve my problem?
The kinect is a very sensitive device an struggles with compatibility im pretty sure there not compatible with each other
Will this product work with the eForCity Dual Charging Station w/ 2 Rechargeable Batteries? I already use my USB port.
Not sure.
iS ONE OF THE CONNECTORS A FEMALE usb CONNECTOR
There is a female connection, but it's for the male portion of the kinect to plug into. (The kinect looks like a usb male connection but it has a bevel corner)
Does the screen protector also fit on the ps vita 2000/slim?
I don't know for sure, but it would probably work. I would think it would be harder to overlay on the screen though, since you use the buttons on the right to line up the film before you place it.
Is this starter kit made for the Original PS Vita or the PS Vita 2000/Slim?
Original... The slim version didn't even exist by the time I bought this product.
Is this starter kit made for the Original PS Vita or the PS Vita 2000/Slim? If not, which accessories that come with it fit the PS Vita 2000/Slim?
This kit is made for the original PS Vita. Ear buds sound great, pocket pouch fits perfect and snug.
What does it look like on the inside? Why no pictures with the case open? Can someone please post one, as I am leaning toward a different case.
no
Would a ps vita slim fit in this case?
Yep that's what I bought it for. Works good for a thin sided carrying case
Can the PSVita fit in it?
Yes the Vita fits perfect in the soft cover case. The cards fit in the hard case that comes with this kit.
Greetings from Venezuela , wanted to know if it really comes bundled 4GB memory and if amazon can buy 8 item and send it to Venezuela
hi, i am a seller but you need to contact amazon to ask them about if you can buy 8 and if they can ship it to verezuela, i have only 1 thanks
does it come in any other color?
I only have a black one. I'm not sure if it comes in any other colors.
what is the weight?
It is very light.
Will this work with the PS Vita 2000?
yes it should...the ps vita 2000 vs the 1000 has very little differences...the front and back of the console are pretty much the same thing except the 2000 is thinner and slimmer and it has an lcd screen instead of the oled. just like how apple always comes out with new models for the ipad but the exterior pretty much looks the same as the previous model
does this fit the ps vita 2001?
yes it does
Does this really eliminate/reduce fingerprints?
I do not think so. You could still see fingerprints especially when you sweating a lot. However, it do protect the screen.
Will this perfectly fit on PS Vita 2000 (slim)??
Got about 2mm extra on each side of lines up correctly.
Would this fit a Vita slim?
Like a glove
Can This replace my DS lite? Will I still be able to play my original DS games?
Yes, but I'd recommend an XL model with its 90% larger screens and better build quality. (EDIT: The XL is also backwards compatible...realized that might not be clear from my post!)
Can you play regular ds games on the 3ds?
You can but there are some aspect like blowing into the microphone slot thing from the first DS that doesn't seem to work anymore, or for me to get around it, I'll have to dig around in some forums. But I dug out my old Sims 2 game and it worked until I got to that glitch.
So.. I'm not going to have to move to Japan and learn how to read and speak Japanese in order to play this system right??
No
Can I play Japanese games on this? Because the Japanese version can only play games from Japan... So I don't know if it's the same with this.
The 3DS is region locked.
Is this a US 3DS? I bought US 3DS games, but can't play them on my Australian 3DS because the DS is region locked, so i'm looking for a US 3DS.
Yes this is a US version of the 3DS
Can this product change language from English to Chinese and get chinese game?
no idea
Is this a US based product? Last DS I bought from Amazon came from China and I had lots of problems with it
Most US based companies that produce electronics work out of China but the product seems to work fine
What is the difference between this product and the one in here--http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-...
Most likely the one with the higher price has the newest update, but if you connect it to WiFi it will automatically update for free.
does the 3DS come with the animation app like the DSi did?
No
The device comes pre-installed games. regards
No , you have to buy the games.
Can I use with "Windows 8" without any problems ???
yes I use Windows 8
Do all switches and buttons work properly and do what they are supposed to?
Your question is too general for a simple "Yes/No" answer. I assume you are referring to the buttons and switches in the cockpit simulations? Firstly, it depends upon which aircraft simulation you are using - some of them, like the Cessna 172 are well-supported, and others have less complete support. Most of the commercially available plane simulations for X-Plane have very well-equipped simulations Then, what do you mean "do what they are supposed to do". Switches for flaps, and turning on an off lights etc normally are pretty realistic. Some of the more complex GPS navigational equipment is not 100% identical in function to the equipment in the real aircraft, but most normal users are unlikely to be affected by that. Most radio navigational equipment works as expected. Generally X-Plane cockpit simulations are pretty good.
system requirements for mac and pc?
Shelly, I Have A Brand New Acer Computer With A 64 Bit System And All The Necessary Equipment To Run xplane 10, My Problem Is Not The Computer. It Is Setting Up The Game Operation. For Instance, I Can't Get The Null Zones Properly Set For Positive Control Of The Airplanes, In Addition, The Throttle Will Not Decrease To 600 Rpm During Landing Approach, It Decreased To 1000 rpm. Very Hard To Control Landings.my Last Flt Sim. Game Was 95, Lots Of Changes Plus This Game Is More REal. I Am Going To Contact X-Plane Support For Both Problems. It's Getting Better. Thank You
I need the game in spanish... can i choose the language in the game?
Spanish is included on the disc, you have to choose it when you are installing the game.
I just ordered X-Plane 10 Global Flight Simulator (PC &amp; MAC). Would you make sure that you send me the 64-bit version? Thank you!!
You need to contact the vendor directly. This is for questions about how to use the product or its features.
it didn't say about that how much Ram or vga do I need on my pc
It only states that you will need 75gb for the entire scenery.
Do you recommend add-ons? If so, can you buy add-ons and how much do they cost?
There are tons of add-ons available. It works within the community of x-plane.org. There you can find freeware and payware add-ons. For example, you can download or purchase aircraft, utilities, etc... Here are a few sites to check out, they are all related to X-Plane 9 or 10 http://www.x-plane.org/ http://store.x-plane.org/ http://shadetreemicro.com/ http://www.c74.net/xplane/_xpo_coop.html http://www.petersaircraft.com/
have spanish ?
Not sure . :(
Can I use it with Windows Vista?
Yes, but highly recommend you go to Windows 7. Skip 8!
Does it run on a 32 bit Windows 7 ?
Yes
My current hard drive keeps saving corrupt data and slowing the xbox down, for some reason my xbox wont read any game that has the corrupt data on it. Will this happen with this hard drive?
I haven't had any problems like that up to this date. I was actually suprised by the quality of this hard drive because it looks like an exact clone to the Microsoft one. I know this doesn't really answer your question and that's because I haven't in countered your problem. I am not going to swear by this HDD as the reading might be your Xbox or might be the HDD if your looking to buy it do it. It's insanely great quality for the price.
Is this hard drive backwards compatible with Xbox 1 games? I know these hard drives need to have a partition in them for older Xbox 1 games to play.
I put an Xbox 1 game in and got an error message :-(
Will this work with an original XBox game? I've been wanting to play Shenmue II with my XBox 360 Slim, but don't know if this harddrive would work.
The hard drive has nothing to do with being able to play an original Xbox game on the 360. Take a look at the wiki page for compatible games https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360
does this just plug into the back of your console?
There is a cover on the right back side that you pull off. Pull out the old drive and plug in the new.
I bought this hard drive a year ago and it does not work. The xbox will not recognize this drive. Is there a warranty ?
The one I bought had a 30 day warrantee from the seller. Did you check with the seller you bought from to see if they had a warrantee? not all sellers do this.
Does it work for installing Battlefield 4? And do you know this from experience?
Yes, this hard drive will be able to hold any game install up to 250 GB. I've installed battle field 3 and it works fine.
is this compatible with an xbox 360 S console?
Yes it is compatible with the Slim edition of the 360.
Is this product originally associated with Xbox?
By "originally associated" do you mean made or certified by Microsoft? It is not made by Microsoft, and I'm not sure, but I think it is not Microsoft certified. However, the disk works excellent. I just unpacked and plugged, and it worked. I have downloaded a lot of games and I still have plenty of space. I have not had any issue with it so far. I've been using the disk for over 7 months now. I hope this helps :)
Has anyone had this product for more than 6 months and if so have they had any problems with it?
My son has had this for about 8 months. No problems. I was worried about the durability because he actually removes it almost daily to go back and forth from moms to dads house to keep all his game data current while playing xbox at either house. He has taken it to friends house and plugged it in there to access his data, he did have to log in as himself. So worth the price. So glad we got it. No problems with DLC add ons or games.
Does this come with a cord? If not, how do you install this product? I'm considering buying it
You just stick it in the Xbox 360 slim and move your files from internal storage to the hard drive. When you first play a game it will ask you which save device to save on and you need to say the hard drive.
Considering the steam version of this game has a Mac option, does this code work for downloading the Mac version or is it only for PC?
It uses steam as the DRM so the only difference is who you're buying it from. It'll act the same as if you bought the game from steam once you redeem the code you get. If steam has a Mac option then it should work.
Does this download work with Windows 8.1? I'd like an updated answer before I purchase. Thanks to anyone who can help me out!
I run it on my W8.1 laptop. Should work with any decent Windows computer - I believe that any program that ran on W7 is backward compatible with newer windows OSs.
does the game work with Windows 8.1?
We have't tried 8.1 but it does work with 8.0.
Does purchasing the game here give a steam key?
Indeed it does. All of CKII and its respective DLC are Steam managed DRM.
Does buying this give me all the DlC that is on steam?
No

Do these let in alot of background noise?
Virtually no background noise
do these head phones actually allow you to hear the game play audio or just voice chat ?
Both.
How long do the till it needs to charge or can I just pop new batteries in it
Mike the X32 uses two AAA batteries. Not sure how long it lasts, but I'd get some rechargeable ones and just swap them out.
The cord that goes from the headset to the XBox 360 controller on my 2 year old X32 is causing static and loss of audio. Where do I get a new cord?
YOu need a new talkback cable http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/cables-parts/ear-force-xtc/348 or on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-Force-Xbox-360-Talkback/dp/B00B08REVE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1418737551&sr=8-1&keywords=xbox+360+talkback+cable
Can I just play my games offline and hear game sound on headphones or do I need to play online?
Your headset receives whatever sounds are coming over your TV. You can hear your games just as much as you can on your TV. In fact, if you need, you will hear your standard TV channels, DVDs, etc., over your headset
Does it work with Xbox One?
If you purchase a Xbox One headset adapter you can use the X32 with an Xbox One and you won't need to use your Kinect for chat. For chat you would run a cord from the headset to the adapter, which lugs into the Xbox One wireless game controller. http://www.turtlebeach.com/products/accessories/xbox-one-adapters.
can you sound whore with these?
Yea you hear everything..which side from behind...youll love the way it sounds when you become the predator or Michael Meyers
Can you use more than one headset at a time?
No the WiFi receiver is programed to one headset at a time.
does the mic work good
Mic sounds great and no one online has complained about my mic. can hear everyone else great too.
If I buy these do I need to purchase any other cords for it to connect to my xbox 360? Will they work on my xbox One?
You do not need to purchase anything for it to work on your Xbox 360. These type of headphones do not work with the Xbox one
What are all the included cables?
It comes with a digital optical cable, a USB cable for power, and a 3.5mm cable. You can see a parts diagram here http://www.turtlebeach.com/assets/products/33/DSS2_in_the_box.jpg
does it work with ps3
Yes it does it work really good with ps3 I love it
If you use it with an optical output on a Panasonic TV can you also listen to external sound? How can this be done? For people who are hearing impaire
Hello Bat, Could you please clarify what you mean by external sound? I would be glad to answer you question as soon as you do that favor.
What is the difference between the DSS2 and the DSS1?
Head over to the turtle beach website and all the spec diff will be explained.
Will this headset give me surround sound from my ps4 to turtle beach stealth 400?
Your headset would need to be compatible with surround sound. And its simulated surround not true. I'm not familiar with the stealth but if it came as a stereo then this will not help you.
Can you use external speakers (like through a stereo receiver) instead of headphones and still get the same surround effect?
You will get the sorround effect but it will be much less effective because you will listen to both speakers in both ears. This mix may fool your perception of the sound position intended from the game. For a stereo speaker set up I would not recommend it.
How do you set this up with Xbox one? I can't get the chat to work any help would be appreciated.
it really depends on your headset but if you just want to get game audio to your headset, you need to plug in the optical digital cable that comes with this device into the back of your xbox one and the other end to this device. then plug in the usb cord to one of the usb ports on your xbox one. then you just plug in your headphones to the front of the Dss2. which headset do you have? Edit: forgot to mention that you need to go into the xbox one settings and find the audio section and make the optical digital audio on
does it work with xbox one?
Yes. It will work with any device that has digital optical output.
can you pair wireless headphones to it
You can connect the audio output on this unit to the input of the unit for the wireless headphones and it does work. I used x32's in this fashion and it works perfectly.
Is this the right decoder needed from a Samsung 4k to a Sound Bar that does not have an internal decoder in order to get all sounds from PS4 &amp; DVR?
I doubt it... This is designed for a headset, not a soundbar.
Is this just the headset or does it include the transmitter, cables, etc.?
Yes, it comes with the headphones, transmitter, & the cables. It should have everything you need! If you are getting them for games like Call of Duty you will love them! It's like hearing online for the first time!
can they be used with x-box one
Louise, you would also have to purchase an Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter sold by Microsoft. And then you would use the Xbox 360 talkback cable that comes with the X42 and run that cable from the headset to the adapter, which connects to the controller, for chat. So yes you can use it, but you are tethereed to the controller and you need to purchase an adapter. The only 100 percent wireless headset on the market for the Xbox One is the Stealth 500X.
Is it wireless
wireless as in dont need a 12ft cord going across your room? then yes its wireless... but a 2ft cord from headset to controller? no
Is this true surround or virtual surround?
This is a juicy question. All headset surround sound is 'virtual' -- digital signal processing is used to give you a surround sound experience. I won't get into the math. That said, it is extremely effective, more so than having a typical home theater set-up with multiple speakers. Because your left ear only hears the left channel, and the right ear only hears the right channel, a headset can deliver a really immersive and accurate surround sound signal. There are people who will argue all day long that you need to have multiple speakers in a headset for 'true' surround sound, but actually sticking a bunch of speakers in a small space like that is more likely to create audio chaos than quality surround sound. Trust me on this, I work at a headset company. I wear them when I play and the quality of the surround is amazing. You can also read reviews of our headsets ... the writers all say the same.
Does it need batteries or is it rechargable?
2 AAA batteries.
it is compatible with ps4 and pc?
No
does it work on xbox one and pc
Turtle beach made an adapter to fit the Xbox One's controller. The headset will work with PC with sound, but no voice support.
My Xbox 360 E has no digital optical port. Will these work?
You can route the audio through your TV "if" your TV has an optical output. You would want to check and make sure.
What is the best headset to use for dance games that you can sing with like Dance Central and The Just Dance games?
Any wireless headset in your price range for the game machine you own will work just fine. The Turtle Beach Ear Force X42 are affordable and have worked very well for us. They also work for both the xbox 360 and PS4 systems. FWIW.
I bought this for my son in Chicago while im in Afghanistan, He said that it needs a adaptar to be able to hear the game play? Need Name of part plz
Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter
Razer Naga Hex sharing reviews with regular Naga?? How can you share reviews between products (mice in this case) that have entirely different layouts and designs?
Exactly. Some things, like hard drives of the same make, model and series that just have different sizes... those I can see lumping together. But these Razer mice are NOT THE SAME PRODUCT at all. A review of one is not valid for a review of another one. Amazon failed big time combining these.
Can the buttons be used to bind any sort of macros (shift+F1, etc) or can they only switch between 1-6 and numpad 1-6?
If you install the Razer software you can set them to anything.
why is the green one more expensive?
price is depends upon the availability on the market.
This could potentially be a stupid question, but: Is this mouse good to play League of Legends with? :]
Well since I got the razer naga hex league of legends edition I would say yes it is. It has the perfect amount of buttons for how many item slots there are but with season 4 there is now 7 buttons 6 items and 1 trinket so this means you wont be ablr to have the whole bag resdy to go you might have to set some other macro up to use the 6th item slot because thetrinkret will use number 4 or 6 I csnt remember... long story short ya its good for lol ps I sent this on a phone after losing a ranked game at 1:30 AM so idc about sll the typos that this probably has!
Has anyone else had the problem with the mouse not working at all after some time? Is there a way to fix it?
The one we bought stopped working after only a few months. Amazon has only a 30 day return policy so we contacted the manufacturer and they are supposed to replace.
Does the scroll wheel tilt left and right (in addition to clicking down and scrolling up and down)?
No
Is that a 7th button in the middle of the 6 side buttons or is it just a nub for resting your thumb.
It's a plastic nub that pops in. Has different sizes.
is this wireless
It is not wireless. Gamers prefer wired accessories because the respond speed is much faster than wireless mouses, plus with the Razer Naga Hex the wire is different than wires compared to the iPhone in which are easier to break when pulled.
Can the scroll wheel move left and right as the Tillt Click on the Naga 2014?
Yes it can move to the right only
Is the Razer Naga Hex compatible with macs?
Yes. Razor's Synapse software works great on Macs.
Will this work for pc?
Please note the following from the Turtlebeach Support website: "The... XP400, PX5, XP500, Tango, X-Ray, Delta, and Phantom headsets were designed for use with PS3 and Xbox 360 game consoles. It is only possible to use these headsets on a PC or Mac if you have the correct configuration and hardware. We recommend using one of our many PC compatible models instead, such as the PX3 or Z300." I do not have the Bluetooth setup to use on my PC, so half of the function of the headphones is lost to me unless I spend extra money and time figuring it out. IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS FOR PC, GET SOMETHING ELSE FROM TURTLEBEACH.
Is it compatible with Xbox one?
It supposed to be once you buy the adapter for xbox one. Check turtlebeach.com just in case. I know they have instructions and stuff on there
Does the xp400 sound quality differ on a ps3 compared to the xbox360?
Technically speaking the console has less to do with the quality of the sound, if not related at all. However the game its self will affect the quality of the surround sound features. If you play newer games that support dolby digital youll be fine. Hope this statement helps! - Jake
Can you hear your voice through the headset when you speak?
Yes you can, it's great so you don't scream every time you speak. Also you can adjust the volume in which you can hear your self.
Does this headset have an adapter to allow it to connect to a headphone jack on a TV/phone to double as a headset for watching movies, music etc.
Yes. The transmitter does have a 3.5mm port to allow it to connect to any portable device or T.V.
Does the transmitter have to be plugged into USB for power? I wanted to hook up to my Samsung TV (I think the USB ports have limited output)
I'm not sure how much power it draws, but I do know that drivers may be an issue as these will not work with Linux without a fair bit of work. So the TV may not transmit poperly. if my TV has a USB input I may try it out and let you know.
It says that this headset can be paired with a bluetooth capable smartphone. Can you stream music through these, or is it only for voice calls?
No it cannot. The bluetooth is use for chatting or speaking with the Mic wirelessly. If you want the smarthphone to sync with music then the XP510 is capable everything
Can you run an aux line in through the "Analog in" and hear that sound source as well as the sound source from the Optical in at the same time?
You can't. As soon as it detects audio from the analog in, it goes to that one instead.
Does this come with a cord or is it strictly bluetooth
The headset and transmitting piece it comes with has many options. It comes with an optical cord which is the main audio output of most modern gaming systems (hence why it's made for Xbox as both the 360 and One use this output). The transmitter also has an option auxiliary input so you can use the headset for computers or even phones. The headset does not come with this cord but these types of cords aren't hard to find. As for the headset, it has Bluetooth and a 3mm output that can only be used for controllers or chat adapters. There is no main input on the headset as the transmitter handles this.
Since my Xbox One (with Kinect) is synced with my TV, can I also listen to TV shows &amp; movies with these wirelessly? THANKS!
Yup. I do. The only trick with these headphones is you have to buy the cable and special adapter for the X-Box One for chat to work with the X-Box One.

I really want to play this game but I'm sort of leery of the difficulty level I keep hearing about. Is it so hard it's frustrating?
Yes, it is frustrating... but in a good way. The key to the Soul's games is to block with a shield; so watch your enemy and raise your shield as he moves to strike. This will open them up to an attack by you. Once this is learned it really gets fun!! but remember... all enemies are DIFFERENT! It's about timing! Hope that helps! Good Luck!
IS THIS GAME ONLINE ONLY?
no its a single player game, but there is a lot of features that require an internet connection. caps lock is cruise control for cool
Does this game have an online co-op mode where you can play private with a friend?
No, It has only a online mode where you can play but not in private, some player can put a signal on the floor and you can invoke the spirit of him for your help.
comes in Spanish
Yes, Spanish subs.
Can you dodge, block, and counter? Do you get health regain rings and necklace, and do you get health steal per hit armor?
you can, you can get health regain rings, the problem with the game I found not to my liking is that if you die, you start with less health compared to other games that you start with full health, the game is really difficult for me even at normal mode
What's with the wide baseball bat swings with two handed sword? Real swordsmen only did quick snap strikes back then.
Be wary of recklessness
On the PS3 version, do you experience difficulty connecting to the servers due to overload (not due to a banned account)?
Impossible to say what causes lost connection as the message on screen does not tell you - it just says "lost connection" so can be any type of fault (you or them)
Do I need to play the first one to understand whats going on?
No I don't think.but the first one was great I would give it a shot
Is there a lot of repetitive grinding in this game? I prefer games like The Last of Us...
Yes, Yes, Yes. I played the game for 3 hours, saved and turned the console off. When I turned the game back on all my "money" or souls were gone and I was back to the beginning. So unless you have time to kill, F this game.
How is the pvp combat system compared to Dark Souls? I was obsessed with Dark Souls but Dark Souls 2 looks a bit sluggish and unresponsive.
I felt like it was faster paced and smoother. They did take away the kick and added some stupid shield break which is almost useless. If you where obsessed with DS1 then you should definitely play DS2. It's for sure an upgrade.
Will this game work on a windows 7 home premium?
It depends on how good your computer is. If you have a good graphics card and processer, then yes it will run on windows 7
I have played this on a dell computer that had windows xp, 3gb of ram does this game cause viruses?
No. A game will not cause viruses.
will this game work with windows 8.1?
It actually works amazing on windows 8.1
Is it a mission or free play?
well half the island is locked unless you use a flating car cheat to get to the other side of the island than it has a freemode. GTA Vice City is the same as almost anyother grand theft auto game except it has a Miami Vice or Scar Face feel to it. All Rockstars GTA games are sandboxes(meaning you can move around the map without doing missions).

If I buy the game used, can I still play online or do I need to purchase online pass?
No, u can still play online. Luckely you will still have 5 characters included no need any codes n u can play with your 4 friends in tag fight which is two agaisnt two as a team. This game is worth it n one of the best of all MK games.
It shows freddy on the game case. Do you still have to purchase him from psn to play or does he come with the game now?
all characters shown including freddy and kratos are included in the game, ready to play. just go to the bottom left or right corner of the boxes you choose your player from and you get the option to choose them.
do the dlc characters come on the disc or do you need to put in a code?
Well, the ome I got, come on the disc.
Does this come with the alternate costume pack Klassic Skins?
Yes. It comes with every skin unlocked already. :)
does this psn avatars
No it doesn't come with any PSN avatars. You have to buy those from the Playstation Store separately.
Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Yes, it does.
HI is a Disc or a online code???
Disc.
Can I use this game on a Japanese PS3?
Yes you should, unless the Disc Type is not compatible in Japan or on Japanese (as u say) PS3 devices. Mine is BLUS30902GH
Is this a platform game with the players facing each other, or is it like an arena type fighting game where the characters can move in all dimensions?
It is a 2-dimensional platform fighting game with opponents facing each other.
it is Digital Game or Blu Ray?
It is a Blu Ray game. It has excellent quality I used to have it on 360 and it looks tons better with the Blu Ray format.
Is this locked to a network?
Officially ATT, but there is a work around to save tons of money. Most people do not know it, but TracFone owns ATT, they are also behind the Straight Talk cut rate service provider at Wal-Mart. What you do, is buy the sim from Wal-mart (couple of bucks) then get the data only plan. Use the associated website to top it off once a month, or only when traveling. You get the same network, but at dirt cheap pricing. (PS, also works great for most ATT phones, it must have a sim. My phone plan went from over $150 to $50)
what exactly is included within this bundle besides a Vita?
The vita, a 4 gb Sim card, USB cable, ac adapter, ac power cord, printed materials.
Can you use this with regular WiFi, or do you have to buy the AT&amp;T thing?
Yes you can use it with regular wifi, I use it every day without any 3g chip in it.
can i use it with a different provider besides AT&amp;T?
I'm not sure why exactly but only AT&T provides the Vita's 3G capabilities. I just use mine on wifi when available.
How many hour's of gameplay will it last before the battery needs to be re-charged?
Depends on if you have the Wi-Fi on or off, if you have it on it's going to drain the battery. Say 3 hours or so? Without it 4 hours, but I believe you can shut off the system without powering it off completely to conserve power.
what music formats does it play?
mp3 mp4 wma. I'm sure it plays others but I haven't tried any other ones yet.
is this unlocked for any carrier??
I don't believe it is locked. My Vita when I bought it from here came with a sim card for at&t so I'm guessing that you could just put another in because Sony says it's not locked to any specific carrier.
Does Vita have a GPS for the car?
If you have 3G on your psvita, then yes. .
Does it come with warranty
No
So, what is the upside to the regular Vita wifi?
The Vita with 3G had the ability to go online anywhere you want but you have to purchase a plan from AT&T.
Does it work for ps3?
This will NOT work for the playstation 3 as it only has a small jack that is customary on laptops, phones ect. You will either need to get a wireless headset or look into getting the Sony pulse. If you want to get a cheap mic, use the official Sony branded blutooth headset that pairs automatically with your PS3. Hope this helps :)
I work allot via voip and am looking for crisp clear speech and Limited to no background noise. How well will this work for me?
I'm not sure how well this exact model will work for that since the mic is in the cord about 5-6" down. I'd definitely recommend one of their headsets with the mic that positions in front of the mouth. I have a Turtle Beach PX22 at home that I use on Skype and it works very well. As far as the background noise goes that's going to be more with the software you use. In my experience Skype definitely picked up on the background noise from all parties in the calls.
Is the cord detachable, or is it fixed?
Completely fixed
My cat ruined my headset's cable. Anyone know how/where to get a replacement cable?
The M5 cable does not detach so I do not think you can replace it.
is this 4 xbox 360 or ps
It's more for tablet or ipod, it has a 3.5mm jack, it will work with an xbox 360 if you get an adapter
Is this good for gaming on a computer?
I use them for gaming and watching movies on Xbox, tablet and computer. Very decent sound! Only had to send them in for warranty replacement due to all of a sudden they started messing but turtle beach sent me an upgraded pair M7 I think.
Does it Work with Xbox 360
No
Does it require separate ports for the headphones &amp; mike, or will a single headphone jack for remote phone or cell allow hearing AND speaking Thanks!
The headphones come with an adapter that splits into 2 jacks. One for recieving audio& another for the microphone
does the mic have a mute button?
No, this isnt a gaming set though, has no chat mic and doesnt fit with controllers
Does this work with Xbox 360? If not could you please tell my which model does? and does it (or the other) plug right into the controller? Thank you!
Sorry I don't think it does but if you go to turtle beach.com the website will inform you better than I can.
is this for the 1000 or 2000 series vita? i just tried to buy same brand from game stop and did not fit my original vita.
This is for the original vita system. You have to place the system in the grips at an angle. Where the top buttons are on the vita, they go in first at a downward angle, then the rest of the system snaps right in.
Does it work well with the PS Vita Slim?
Here the 2k model www.amazon.com/Vita-2000-Trigger-Grip-Sony-PSP/dp/B00JYE8L9K/
Will the grips still fit on the vita if it has a case on it? I have the eForCity snap on crystal case
Probably not because this case doesnt not leave any space
I heard about the damage that give the ps vita shoulder trigger. Is that true? I really want to buy this hand grip but the review left me uncertain?
the trigger grips are really worth it. Like all products, there will be wear and tear but it depends on how much and how vigorously you use them. Honestly I used them so much, that I can't play without them. Get them bro.
Does this allow for access to a portable charger?
Of course and you can easily remove or insert your PS vita from the case AT THE SAME TIME as your charging and have earphones plugged in. This case gives you access to all ports except the Sim card port on the 3g model.
I heard about the damage that give the ps vita shoulder trigger. Is that true? I really want to buy this hand grip but the review left me uncertain?
I don't use my Vita a ton but I found the grip very nice for racing games. There is play in the triggers so it's not great for a FPS but I loved it for NFS.
Is there ANY hard case/pouch out there sized to accommodate a Vita 1000 with these grips applied? I don't want to have to risk scratching.
I use a kindle fire soft case from Belkin and it fits perfect with the grip, lots of protection too. Got it at target. I took the grip with me to figure out what would fit.
Does it come with l2/r2 buttons because I am trying to play ff8
No it doesnt. I also would recommend abother product like the Nyko grips
Does this get rid of having to use the rear touch pad?
No, you can still use the rear touch pad
I heard that this does NOT fit the new PS Vita Slim released May 6th 2014, but is there one available for it? I can't seem to find one. Thanks.
http://www.amazon.com/Vita-2000-Trigger-Grip-Sony-PSP/dp/B00JYE8L9K/ref=pd_sim_vg_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=13J63RJWF0CP4B2RVKTY
Can you change the LED's Color? or is it stuck to blue?
It's always blue.
Windows 8 operating system?
I have used this mouse on both Windows 7 and Windows 8 (without the need to install the drivers that are included with the disc) and can report there have been no issues or "quirks" with this mouse on either OS. This is the best mouse I have ever owned (it took me years to upgrade from my old Intellimouse Explorer -- which is now discontinued).
Does it works on win 8?
Yes it does and quite well.
can l use this on mac
Not really, it moves the cursor and left/right/scroll buttons click but no further customization. Logitech has some decent ones that provide mac drivers and you get to use/map the extra buttons. I have a second one of these at home now since I switched to a mac at work and swapped to a logitech. Shrug, great mouse but only worth it for windows.
Is this a pack of 3 controllers?
Nope, just the one ball controller.
Does this come with a USB cable for charging?
I bought two of these and received them in the mail yesterday. Mine both came with charging cables that you can plug directly into the ps3, or any usb charging device. I recommend doing what I did, and just buy a charge station if you have multiple controllers. So much easier to manage. Hope this helps.
Should I also need the PlayStation Eye to play Just Dance on the TV , or will be ok if I just buy the Move Motion Controller?
yes the eye is what the remote goes by.double check the game it should tell u what u need .
What is bulk packaging?
I'm guessing but I assume it means buying in bulk. Large quantities of an item.
Does it work with PS4?
Yes the Move Motion Controller does work on the PS4 and PS3. Tested with Just Dance on the PS4
Does this work for the playstation 4 as well?
no, it does not. The controller will work with the new PS4 Eye, but the Playstation Eye included in this pack is only designed for the PS3.
is this kit oem (all parts separatly) or BOX (all parts in sony color box ?
All parts separately and they are all original
does this has a charger for the controller? how does it charge?
it's battery operated
Does this include all hardware for ps3 move?
Hi, the bundle that we purchased included: the move controller, the eye camera and the playstation move demo disc. You will have to purchase games separately. I'm including a link with some useful information about the PS3 move setup: https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2092/~/playstation%C2%AEmove-setup We are satisfied with this purchase.
Does it come with a mounting bracket for the tv? How does it sit on top of the tv, if no bracket is included?
No, it does not but Playstation does sell a mounting clip that is sold through Amazon. Here is some information regarding the mounting clip that I found... The officially Sony licensed PS3 Eye Camera Mounting Clip conveniently mounts the PlayStation Eye camera on flat panel televisions. The clip holds the EYE camera in perfect position for Move gameplay and features a wide range of adjustable settings for various flat-panel HDTV shapes. The Mounting Clip is easy to use straight out of the box with no need to use any adhesive.PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye Camera each sold separately. The current price is $28.99
I see the charger available seperately. Does it come with a charger? Also, one comment says it comes with a gun?
It is charged by the same mini USB that charges the Dualshock 3. Mine was used so it did not include a charging cord. I'd assume the new ones do. Also, no it does not come with a gun. But you can find them online and in stores for CHEAP.
Is it a big deal to have the Motion Controller without the Move Navigation Controller?
I've never used the Navigation Controller. Never had to. All the games and functions are accessible using the Move or the regular 6-way controllers.
How big of a deal is it not having the motion controller?
A lot of the games you won't be able to play without it.
is there 2 controllers
No just one.
Are all PS3 games compatable with this?
Sorry, I gave it as a gift, I dont know
This cable works without having a battery? I mean, It will charge my controller without a battery inside?
yes the cable work with out the battery, plus it keeps your controller on with the charging cable pluged in the controller. but it wont carge your controller on it own with out charging battery that is attached to the controller, it would need a charging battery that can be charged to keep the controller on and active.
If i plugged this into my 360 controller and then the usb into my pc could it be used as a wired controller for pc gaming
My son tried this. It does not work. There may be some usb drivers available that would make it work but we have never looked.
Hey, I have a regular xbox 360 wireless controller. The product says "Charging Cable," but if it plays PC too (given the drivers)?
I could never get it to work on my PC except for charging. I ended up buying an xbox 360 wireless usb receiver for it instead.
Would it work with AA batteries
No
Does it works with PC too? And I will be able to use at the same time this and wireless receiver on my PC?
I'm not sure cuz my cable riped cuz they crossed and pulled it off so it I put it on my Xbox control and didn't turn on so I'm not sure if it's the cable or the pc that doesn't for it so check it for yourself and see if it works
Okay, would this cable work to turn my controller into s game pad for my PC? Or do I have to buy a wireless adapter.
Yes it will just plug this cable into your controller and then plug it in your PC to update the cord and its drivers so it can be able to charge your controller on the PC and Xbox console you'll know it'll work once after it installs your the cord drivers to your PC the red light will come on on the cord. To play with the wireless controller on your PC while being plugged up just go to your device manager and scroll all the way at the bottom and select your controller properties and then select its wireless playback drivers for your PC to Xbox controller.
Will this allow me to use it as a gamepad for PC?
no you need a http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Pc-Gaming-Receiver-Xbox-xbox360/dp/B0076HD2W8/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1405580456&sr=1-3&keywords=xbox+360+wireless+adapter if its a wireless controller and the battery charger you asked about or a wired controller
What do each of the media buttons do? Is there a volume up, down, mute, and next song button?
Starting from the far left, the first one is a rewind button, the second play/pause, the third is fast forward, the fourth is mute, the fifth decreases volume, and the sixth increases it. I dont personally know what the rewind pause/play and fast forward buttons are for.
Is it wireless ?
No, It is wired.
How long is the wire of the keyboard?
the standard length, dont expect anything special from this keyboard, it is a bottom of the line gaming keyboard that works surprisingly well
is this mechanical
Trust me I have owned the Razer Black Widow and this keyboard feels good, but is not mechanical in any way.
Can you remove the orange keys and replace them with black ones (does the keyboard come with any)?
It did not come with black keys. This is a pretty average membrane keyboard and if you don't want orange keys, you shouldn't buy the keyboard.
Will this work with Mac?
It will work, the Windows and Alt key will act as the Command and Options key. Although, they will be reversed, this can be fixed with a program called Double Command.
Does it have the back little feet behind it,to elevate the keyboard?
Yes
How long is the length of the cord i need one that is at least 6ft
Probably close to 4 foot long.
Does it support windows 8?
yes works with windows 8
What kind of key switch does this keyboard use?
I'm not sure, but for this price I'm assuming simply a membrane type. It does have a nice tactile feel.
Do I have to have Steam to play this game?
Yes, I bought it on Amazon and they sent me the game but I had to use Steam to play. Steam is ok except it can be a pain in the butt to log on with their password system. The game is very good. I think if you buy the game and not the download you should not have to fool with 3rd party sites to play the game.
can this work on my IMAC
If your machine is less then three years old and you have a Windows install to boot, you can.
will this game play on windows 7 32 bit.
Yes, It is the current operating program on my Desk top computer , the game says both 7 and Vista.
Can this be played on windows vista 32 Bit?
Yes
What are the spec. for video card Now using 7800
NO IDEA!
If I load from disc will I still have to use Steam?
yes plus they auto update each time you start the game
what are the system requirments on this game?
From the website: http://us-ci-games.gamesplanet.com/shop/sniper-ghost-warrior-2/ OS : Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7, with the latest Service Pack CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2Ghz, or AMD Athlon 64 x2 2Ghz, or better RAM: 2GB Video Card: NVidia 8800GT with 512MB RAM or better HDD: 9GB DirectX: 9.0c and a DirectX Compatible Sound Card
does it work under Windows 8.1?
Yes. If it does not auto-detect, go to the device manager and look for it. It will likely be listed as "Unknown Hardware" Right-click, update driver, browse to the bottom of the list and "XBOX 360 Peripherals and accessories" or something to that effect will be listed. Select this and the list of hardware will appear. Choose the XBOX 360 Wireless receiver and go through the install process. The controller/receiver will be installed. Just confirmed it by installing about five minutes ago in Win8.1.
Does this connect more than 1 controller or do I need to buy multiple one?
I have connected at least 2 controllers. I believe a single unit will connect up to 4.
does this work with SteamOS?
Yes use it everyday
Will this work with 64 bit Windows 7?
Yes, that is what I'm running at home and it works perfectly.
Will this still work without a CD Drive?
Yes. The cd is useless anyway. Look at this vid. http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kxa5CJsDzwQ
does this work with a mac
There is a third party driver you can get that makes it work. http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver
Will this work with Fire TV ?
Reports from others online suggest that the Microsoft Branded USB Receiver DOES work with the Amazon Fire TV. Has anyone who's bought THIS one had the chance to try it out with the Fire TV?
How do I connect my controller to the receiver without the CD i lost it
When I bought the gaming receiver, the CD didn't really help with installation so I looked online for installation software. You can install the software from the Windows website: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows And if you have problems even after installing the software, check out this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJSzC7mrduU&src_vid=InwN0fyHy0w&feature=iv&annotation_id=annotation_3692610237 When you first install the receiver, your computer probably won't recognize it as a receiver. The video will teach both how to install it and how to make it easier for the computer to recognize.
Where do I find the drivers for this adapter?
If you're using Microsoft you should be able to browse your computer for the drivers (Windows 7: Devices and Printers - right click USB Receiver for properties - click hardware tab - properties - driver tab - update driver - browse computer. There may be multiple options provided by Microsoft "Xbox 360 Controller for Windows," if the first one doesn't work try the next).
It only blinks once or twice when I hit the button on the receiver is that normal? I can't sync it to my controller.
http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows here to update Drivers and then this how you sync your pc to your controller https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaqFQkSrikA
I have read lots of complaints about people receiving the wrong model for their vita. I have the original vita, will this grip work for that model?
The answer is yes. I also have the original Vita and it works great.
Will this work with PS Vita slim?
No. Fat version only (1000 series)
Do these still fail to hold the additional power after a month of use?
I think it has to do with how you charge it. I thought mine wasn't holding a charge after a few months, but what I found is that if you charge the Power Grip and Vita separately, then it holds its full charge. I don't recall if the manual says to do that, but that's what works for me. I get a full week out of mine on one charge, no problem (one hour train commute to and from work and some time before bed here and there).
What do you recomend to me to use the portable charger of ps vita or this grip? I play ps vita at home most of the time.
I bought this because it is the most comfortable grip out there. I have the portable charger as well, but the benefit the power grip has over the external battery is that there are no wires if you are charging the Vita with it. If that doesn't bother you then it is just a really nice grip that happens to charge the vita as well.
I have the PS Vita Model 1001 that was part of the Assassins Creed Liberation bundle. Will this work with that model?
Yes it should definitely work.
is it possible to change the battery of the nyko?
No I don't believe so
Does this come with a charging cable as well? I lost mine and was hoping for a two for one.
no it does not come with a charger
Can I charge my vita with this grip on?
Yes the port on the bottom of the grip allows you to be plugged in while it is on the vita (in the event you forgot to charge the grip and Vita and are both dead). Personally I never ran into this issue as the grip gives you that second charge for your vita :)
Yes, I have the original vita model. If I have a Hori skin protector attached, will it still fit on the grip? Thanks!
Yes it will fit. The Vita is placed into the Nyko grip at an angle (Top first and then bottom) and once it's resting in the grip there will be only a slight latch on the top and bottom to partially secure it. The main way the Vita is secured is by the locking mechanism on the bottom side at the charging port. The Hori should not ever be affected by what little this grip actually is touching on the Vita's face.
If you ordered this product recently and got the grip for the original Vita instead of the PCH2000, which seller did you get it from?
I got it new from cheek up a seller in japan they have never let me down before so i think you will be happy
Do you need Internet. Connection to play these games?
No.
will this work with windows 8 on a PC
Yes it would
will it work with HP touch screen?
I'm not sure as I don't have HP touch screen. Sorry.
Can you list all the games in this slots adventure pack, please. Thank you.
Carnival, Cash Climb, Chocolate, Dance Electric, Dinosaurs, En Fuego, Fireworks, Fishn' Fortune, Going Once, HO!HO! Dough, Mirage, Order in the Court. BTW, I am running Windows 7 and this game only plays in a small window. It might be better in other operating systems but it sucks in Windows 7.
What games are included in program?
On my laptop must be played in "windowed" form only. Good games, lot of fun.
If I could buy this game, would it have English subtitles? I'm hearing-impaired, so I don't enjoy playing games I can't understand.
You are in luck! When you open the game, you actually have two options for languet. You can either choose dubbed english version, or original Japaneese voices. If you choose the english dubbed version, most of the game will have subtitles, but there will be cut-scenes with no subtitles at all. How-ever, if you choose the original japaneese dub, Every-thing will have subtitles including animated cut-scenes! So when you are on the main-menu of the game, go to "Settings." choose "Languetes." and then choose original Japaneese voices, the entire game will have english subtitles ^^

I received it in a box

yes, it says it works on mac as fare as anything else you can't read their writing nor can you understand and of the printing in the paperwork or on the box? buy it dose say it works on Windows Vista, 98/me/200/and XP and mac I am using it on my windows 7 professional
How many buttons/clickers does this one have? I need at least 3 for Elder Scrolls Online. Thanks in advance!
It has 2 on the left side, 1 left mouse button, 1 right mouse button, and the scroll wheel can be clicked in. There is also a dpi changer behind the scroll wheel, Idk if you can change that to whatever you want though.
does it work for windows 7
Yes it does
Is this mouse compatible with a macbook pro?
Absolutely. Works perfectly.
how are the Mac drivers? can turn off cursor acceleration? or is it just stock mouse controls?
I'm just using stock mouse controls and using a pc.
Does it work with windows 8?
Yes it does.
Does it work with windows 8?
Yes it works with windows 8
Is the light bright and should I buy this product?
the light is very bright and if you are looking for a mouse that can handle ton's of play or work time this is the one to get
is multilanguage? Spanish?
It has four different languages, English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. You can change the text, subtitles and speech, and all of this can be found in the options. If you have any other question I am more then happy to help, I love this game and the story line.
why is it rated M
Because of the misuse of improper footwear in a apocalyptic society gone awry. The amount of gangrene that the two players should have died from due to not taking the time to show proper footwear usage and choices is just appalling. The ESRB saw this and thought about how many kids could be influenced by this game and wear wrong shoes and die an early age so they slapped an M on it. Oh and the violence, blood and cursing as well attributed to the M.
I'm hearing impaired. Are there subtitles and does it effect the game play not being able to hear?
There are subtitles. Being not native English speaker I'm still using them myself... You will loose some atmosphere definitely because of not being able to hear surroundings which are done in absolutely amazing way :(.. But I still think you will enjoy it and the game provides "high awareness" mode when the hero "hear" through walls (you both hear the sounds on long distances *and* see the silhouettes through obstacles) - so should be good to go.
What is the difference between the Standard and Survival Edition?
Survival Edition is a collector's item. (I'm pretty sure) it comes with a statuette and the Pandemic Edition also comes with "The Art of The Last of Us". Hope I helped!
Is I have be 17 to by game?
Yes. This game is rated 17+ for everything from violence and language to gore and nudity. This is an extremely dark game that is aimed towards a mature audience.
for two players?
It has multiplayer modes but the single player storyline game is solo.
Can you play the girl as the main character? or do you have to play the man?
You play as the guy (Joel) for the majority of the game but play as girl (Ellie) for a small part. You can't switch charecters though.
Do it has scary zombies?
No, but they are scary to beat when they outnumber you 4 to 1. That's what makes it fun!!
why is the digital download more expensive the the actual hardware?
You tell me man. Makes no sense.
Is there any detailed information on what this game will be like and include for PS4?
It will release this year with more better graphics & included all DLC's & multiplayers maps
Is it compatible with Windows 8/8.1?
Yes, It's compatible. I have in running on my desktop and my surface pro. Both 8.1
What is the difference between standard and Limited Edition? Also has this game gotten any better since all the launch day problems?
With the limited edition, you get a few more add-ons. Other than that, there is not a difference. Also, we have not had any problems with the game other than it takes awhile to install because of the size. It is a lot more realistic than it use to be.
In the picture you show the Standar version so are you seling the SimCity: Limited Edition or Standar ?
I am not selling anything, the game has drm and is tied to an account once activated. I simply wrote the review to help future customers with their purchases. The limited was a pre order special that came with a couple digital extras and a beta. As far as SimCity standard, it is the same as limited, I believe deluxe is the one with all the bells and whistles with digital content.
Does this game have a product code? You need one to play it.
Yes I believe so and its linked to one email and password.
does it work with windows 7?
yes it does work with Windows 7
will this go on windows vista?
Yes
Do you need origin to install
Yeah before doing so you should install a anti-virus system probably Webroot is the best. The only reason you should install a anti-virus is so you won't end up having a virus like I did.
Do you have to install with origin
Yes because Sim city connects and is run by EA though u can go offline EA requires u to have and enter a key through origin
I've heard that there is now a single-player does that mean that if the internet somehow goes off and I am on single player will I still play.
Correct. The other advantages of single player mode are that the space center work is not bugged and that the prices of the goods are steady and do not swing around. The one disadvantage is that you don't get achievements.
Will the game work on a (Intel(R) Q45/Q43 Express Chipset) video card? Or will I have to get a new card, if so what will fit a Lenovo think center M58
I don't know on that one...might check its compatibility on the website.
Will it work with a fat ps3?
Yes it works on mine
Can you use one of the ports to hook up a external hard drive to the PS3?
Yes
Is it Compatible with the Super Slim?
Even if it did, I wouldn't get it. Mine lasted about a month and quit working. I use my ps3 about 2 times a week if even. So that should tell you something about the device.
should I tape it to the ps3 if it wont stay or is there somthing I can use something else? will it help to put my ps3 vertically
I'm just saying from my experience that it fried my turtle beaches and a racing wheel so I would use it
Can you plug in multiple controllers like for example 4 wired controllers? Would they all work to play multiplayer?
This will work with as many as the Bluetooth can handle. I can plug in all 5 of my Rockband instruments and still use the controllers You may have to manually program the controller numbers on some but yes they would all work
Will this work on the PS4
read my review this thing is a piece of junk
Is the Regal Frostlion Mount available for all the characters in the account or can only use it on one character?
it is account bound so all characters
If i have an account on tera already can I use the stuff from the collectors edition on that account?
Yes, definitely can, and absolutely worth it too! (You even still get Founder's status added to your account, heh. I bought it for the toon unlocks, and that plus the mount alone was worth it, let alone the other cool stuff in the box)
Is it worth buying this when I already am playing for free? I have heard buying this gets you founder's status, but will i have to start over again?
No you will not have to start over again, this will just give you all the perks of being a founder with out paying out the nose. here is the financial bits from my previous review of this item. Once you play one character and type, you're going to want to eventually try them all not to mention open your bank slots (as you acquire a lot of stuff fairly quickly). This is what prompted me to buy a copy the game even though is now free to play. By doing the math I found that the EMP (cash shop dollars for the game) to dollar ratio is about 100:1 (100 points for every dollar) a single character slot is 495 EMP or 3960 EMP to unlock all 8, BUT only for one server! That's a little over $39. Then when you add in the cost of expanding your bank slots that's an additional 495 EMP for 1 slot or 1320 EMP for all 3, costing an additional $5-$13. So in the end you would end up paying between $54.45 - $52.80 just for upgrades on ONE server. So that in mind I decided to buy a physical copy, which will give me all 8 character slots & all 4 bank slots in all the servers not to mention 3 pages instead of 1 in the Brokerage (Player's Market), to save myself money in the long run. I also decided to spend an additional $15 and upgrade to the collectors edition simply to get all the nifty extras! The review by Catpsyche really says it all for why I did. But even then I still saved money! Also just some advice, but if you are going to buy something from the EMP shop save yourself money in the long run and always buy permanent!
Does it actually come with the soundtrack? I've seen some unboxing videos where it doesn't come with the OST.
Mine did not come with a soundtrack
Is this for North American Version or EU one? I ordered one in the past and it turned out to be for the EU version of Tera.
Na
If I already have Tera on my laptop, can I use the code to get the goodies, and use the disk to install on another PC?
You can install Tera on as many PCs as you like. However, the code of goodies is tied to your online account with which you registered on Tera (eg. Mark@someemail.com). Hope this helps.
Do I have to use the activation code to get the mounts? I was hoping they were seperate codes.
The mounts are included in the activation code. After activation, you can find them in the Item Claim tab on the in-game menu; under account-bound items. All your characters can use them.
Is this collectors edition of Tera for the US-Server or the EU-Servers? Afaik, if it is the US-Version it will not work on the EU-Servers.
Yes, this is the one for the US server because it's published by En Masse. The EU publisher is Gameforge.
Does this open up more than 2 character slots on a single server?
yes, it opens all of the available character slots, which I believe are 8 per server. I would suggest reading through the reviews below most of your questions could be answered, as there are a lot of very reliable reviews available. here is mine :http://www.amazon.com/review/R9N8XAQ5U81MC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm you'll also save a lot of money in the long run by buying a copy. but what is included in the CE when you enter the code (enter it both forwards then again backwards): The pack comes with: - Founder Title - 8 character slots (including the 2 given to you) - 4 Bank Slots - Tawny Lion - 2 Semi-Enigmatic Scrolls - 2 Emeralds - Lv 15 Necklace (Account Bound) - Lv 40 Necklace (Account Bound) - Warhorse Mount (Account Bound) - Frost Lion Mount (Account Bound)
If i buy this, can i use the founder code on an already installed game and an already made account?
Yes
What does it mean: "Does not allow Original Xbox game compatibility".
Friends, I bought this disk. It took me longer to figure out WHERE it when, then to install it. this was my second xbox 360 experience in like 5 years. my other uses have been 4 or 5 years ago. It seems like this system the slim, adds an extra step to the save and load process. to ask you WHERE you want to get the data, your 4 mg internal memory, your NEWly installed hard drive, or the cloud. I think that step interfers with the OLD xbox functionality, so they do not work. They mean the old xbox, NOT the xbox 360. so your 360 games should all work fine, I have tried like 12+ games, and they all worked. But I never tried a xbox game. I am happy with this disk, except for the extra step the slim added. Thank you. Dr. Darrell of michigan.
Can i play Titanfall with this hardrive
It's definitely big enough to store the entire game, if that's what you're asking.
can i play destiny
Yes you can play destiny
what is the difference between this one and the one that cost $41 also made by generic?
I can't say, but I CAN say that this drive didn't work and upon asking to return it the company didn't even want it back. Buy a Microsoft drive. They cost more, but they'll work.
does it has to be a xbox slim or does it work with xbox360 e?
From what I understand, all "Slim" labeled hard drives work just as well on the E systems, since they didn't change anything about hard drives in between the two.
How long is the warranty on this hard drive?
1year
I been using this hard drive for a couple of days, however the Xbox now freezes I pull the hard drive out notice it runs very hot, it is temp problem?
hasn't happened to my son.......do you leave the xbox on for long periods? When our computer monitor had heat issues, we bought a small fan that runs whenever the monitor is on and that fixed the overheating problem......
Will I be able to play my original xbox games on my 360 slim with kinect with this hard drive plugged in?
Some games are reverse compatible with a hard drive. Not all original Xbox games are. If the hdd works then yes you should be able to but I would buy it at a game stop location to be on the safe side that way if it does not you can still return it fairly easily.
is this remote fake or really from microsoft?
Yea this controller is definitely a third party controller. To be honest I bought this because it was cheap but for some reason I kept getting shocked by the controller. Eventually it was unbearable and persistent to the point where I sent it back and just bought a microsoft controller. No complaints since then.
Does it work with Windows 7
I did not use the controller I just returned it, it was not the controller pictured or the controller I ordered! I would not buy from this seller!
Does This Work With Windows 8 and I would like to know how this product preforms from a actual owner of this product thank you!
It works perfectly on windows 8 :). And how it performs? It works for what it is, if agame supports an xbox 360 controller it will work. There might even be some mods or workaround a for games that don't support 360. As for the controller itself, hardware, it's great! Everything feels like it should on a 360 controller.
is it compatable with pc games?
Yeah it is, that's the reason I got it, I use it with steam all the time. Might be a bit stiff untill you us just the sesitivy settings, works great after.
how to make it work on xbox
i tryed and it doesnt seem to i would recommend trying to get refund if thats what got it for
Will this controller work with Grand Theft Auto IV for the PC? It's not on Rockstar Games list of supported manufactures for controllers.
No
will this controller work for games on steam
yes
This controller is working for racing games while it is not working for any action game and online game. But why?
could be a compatibility issue - most PC games with controller compatibility are set up to take on-brand xbox controllers, which have a particular kind of input. a lot of off-brand usb controllers have a different kind of input. since the game is set up to only recognize one kind of input, it wont recognize the off-brand controller as a controller at all. x360ce is a controller emulator program you can use to solve this problem. it switches the input so that the game recognizes the controller as a controller. i used it and it worked - you can find the program and tutorials on how to use it with google. it could also be because the controller isnt very good and just doesnt work.
does it work on a xbox 360?
Mine did not work at all! It was plugged into an xbox 360..
is it good and last along time
The length of time the batteries holds a charge sucks. If you basically play alone they should be fine. If yuo rutinly play with others, you probobly wont be satisfied
Does this also charge fully or is it like the charging cable where it says it is done charging and about 5 minutes later it dies on you?
It full charges it
dose it come with the battery packs?
yes, 2 of them.
. 1.Does this work for any Batter pack or is it just the 2 given to you?
Hi, it works with any battery I have the original batteries and the 2 I received with the charger and they all fit in.
When I put these (fully charged) power packs into my 360 controller, all 4 green lights around the xbox button light up and blink. The console will not register that a controller is even active. Anyone know why?
try reconnecting your controller to your xbox 360 here is a video if you need help http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpV-b1de2lM
does anyone know who makes these batteries ? are they made buy nyko
It is not nyko but I do not know who makes it
is this product junk?
Yes
Did you find that these are compatible with your controller or does the controller light just flash when you insert them?
The one battery pack that worked for a short time worked fine.
Will these batteries work with this charger I kept it when the batteries died? http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Charge...
The batteries that I received fit my controller very well. I would think that if you had old batteries that fit your controller, they would fit the the xbox rechargeable unit.
Received item. One of the two batteries will NOT charge. Would like to replace it. How do I go about using the warranty? No paperwork was included.
Same here, I bought two of these chargers, one was fine..the other one had a broken brass strip on it and the battery will not charge on that side. I was wondering the same, how do I get a replacement as this one is obviously defective. I don't want to have to go through the whole process of having to repackage it, sending it out again, and waiting for the replacement. I was very disappointed.
What is the age group for this game
8-14
Can you play the Wii version on the Wii U?
Yes, you can play the Wii version on the Wii U. The Wii U is backwards compatible with all Wii titles.
Is there any continuation from the original "Epic Mickey"? Can you start playing this one even if you have not had / played the previous one?
While it's preferable if you do play the first one as this story refers to the first EM's story and many of the characters make return appearances it is not a must that you play EM before EM2. EM2 will encapsulate the previous story in its cut scenes and it's not that important to be familiar with any character. I didn't find that being familiar with characters from EM enhanced my enjoyment (or lack thereof) of EM2. But I would suggest that you skip EM2 altogether and play through EM, a flawed but satisfying game. EM2 improves on a oft difficult camera (but not by that much) and it's true strength is probably the co-op play it offers but it's not nearly as satisfying a game as the original IMO.
Can you play this game with two paintbrush controllers ? The clicker is very expensive and not very good.
According to this it may work "The controller functions as a Nunchuk when playing Epic Mickey: The Power of Two." [http://www.amazon.com/Epic-Mickey-Mickeys-Paintbrush-Wii-Nintendo/dp/B008FHHT1S]
Have to have the paintbrush
No, you can use the Wii remote as the paintbrush
Does this game require two players?
No, but parts there are a few parts that are easier with two, but still possible with one.
What controllers are needed? Do I need the classic controller or will the regular one and nunchuk work fine?
To answer your question, you do not need the classic controller at all. All you need is the regular Wii controller and nunchuck to play this game. If you want, you can purchase the paint brush nunchuck to make it feel like you are painting, but it is not necessary.
Can it be played in Spanish?
yes i think you can find Spanish in the settings.
What ages can play this game?
All ages, my 9 year old son and my 15-year-old daughter play and we also play, especially when it comes to a solution on a level
Does this game have parts that require reading? And can you die? If so, how easily? My 5 yr old has been playing Kirby's epic yarn for 2 yes now.
This game has a track that require reading, children use their logic at times to find the answer without reading, opportunities are lost and you return to previous game spaces, I recommend starting with Epic one

will it work on a x41
Yes, it will work with an X41.
Will it work for X42's?
It should work as far as I know.
Can I plug one end of this directly into my px4 headset and the other into my controller and have the chat volume and mic mute function properly?
Yes
Will it work for the phantom model?
Yes, this type of cable can be used for Xbox 360 chat with the Phantom headset.
Does it work with the turtle beach X32s?
it should but I am not 100% sure
will it work with the px5
Yes, the Xbox 360 Talkback Cable will work with the PX5 headset.
Will it work on tritton ax 180?
i don't think so judging by the pictures on the triton website the cable looks like it is permanently fixed into the headset itself, if your having issues i'd say your best bet is to take them back to the store and exchange them. or check out the website http://www.trittonaudio.com/prod/parts.asp
Are the end connectors 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm? My son's X31 uses 2.5 mm and a white talkback cable. Newer X31 models appear to be 3.5mm.
Its 2.5mm. The same size as the xbox controller jack for both ends
does this work for X1'S
If your asking if it works for xbox 1 yes but you still need the adapter also. If your talking about the X1 from turtle beach then you need to upgrade that is old and the cable doesnt disconect. Really old. They dont even sell those anymore. Did you mean x11 or something else?
what size is the input 2.5MM?
I'm not sure of the exact measurement but it fits into my Xbox controller just like the one i replaced
hello,in technical details it says that the harddisk is 1TB7200rpm,but in the product disccription it says 750gb 7200rpm+256GB SSD? so which one is it
includes both; a 256 ssd and a 750 hdd
I am buying a laptop with a 1 tb hard drive and 8gb solid state. In this configuration is the OS put on the HDD or SSD?
Windows 7 requires more than 8GB to be stored. In that configuration the OS would be put on the 1TB hard drive. Are you absolutely certain you are buying an 8GB solid state and not a 128GB solid state? 8GB does not hold a lot of data in 2014. If you are indeed purchasing a 128GB solid state then the OS would be loaded on the SSD for performance reasons. That would give you approximately 100GB of usable space for critical applications/games as best practice is keeping your SSD at a minimum of 20% free.
Does this computer ship with a Windows 8 upgrade
Yeah, for $14.99...I already got the notice from Microsoft that it was ready to download...decided...why mess up a good computer!
Does it work with the ps3 slim?
It works on USB. ..I don't even hook mine to the playstation
will this work with a wall charger for a phone like say an htc one?
We tried it and it works that way as well.
Can I leave my controllers in the charging dock after they are done charging?
Yes you can.
Can you charge the controllers with the skin on them? I have a glow in the dark skin cover on one of my controllers and its a pain to have to take off
the port is a really tight fit. it probably wouldn't work with a skin or anything else that would impede the connection in the slightest.
Does it come with a USB cord because mine is broken
Yes, it does. The functionality is iffy though. Mine still works but only one of the ports and it's on and off.
does it come with a battery pack for the controller?
No you have to have the rechargeable controllers already. This is just like the cord but two spots for the controllers to sit in. I wouldn't get it though. Mine was a POS. I just threw it away
Does it come with a charger?
No, It does not. My boyfriend already had a cord to charge his controllers from the play station. He uses the same cord for the charging stand. If you have one of those it should be fine.
Is it worth it to get the Game of the Year Edition?
Yes! Awesome maps and campaign dlc! You get to play as Nightwing and Robin! The dlc campaign is pretty cool! Batman has been captured and play as Robin to save him! Arkham City was favorite of the three. Awesome story! Game of the year edition is a must have! Make sure you preorder the next Batman, Arkham Knight, it's going to be epic!
This or old version?
This one Is really good more stuff. But I haven't played original. But this has dlc's
do you have to have an xbox live account to play the dlc on disc 2, or do you just download it into the xbox
You just download it to the box.
Is there much violence, blood, gore, shooting?
I don't know why the top rated answer said yes. It's a Batman game - there is a small level of violence but it's very tame, showing no blood whatsoever. There is no blood or gore, and shooting is stopped by Batman's armor, and if you were asking if you play as someone who shoots people, Batman only has non-lethal weapons. It's rated T so quite frankly, any kid who is familiar with Batman is probably old enough to play Arkham games.
Anything inappropriate for a 10yr old?
No My son is 6 and loves it
So why does the box say Internet connection required if the DLC is on the disc? Or is it only required for the Harley Quinn content?
I believe it's just for the downloadable content
Can 4 people play this game without internet connection?
No. Its a one player game if playing offline.
The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?? El juego viene en multilenguaje? lo quiero en espa&ntilde;ol
Have you try the system first then the game
are this games safe for kid 14 yrs old
There is a lot of violence in this game, but no blood. It's mostly hand-to-hand combat. I believe it's okay for kids 14 and older.
is there free rome or do you have to stick to the story?
Yeah, you can free roam. There are several sub story lines you can do as well.
Is this an Internet game only or can you just play it on PS3?
You dont need an internet connection for this game. It comes with everything already on the disk, including all of the downloadable content.
Thist game have spanish sub?
Unfortunately it does not. This version is English only audio and subtitles.
I'm living in SIngapore(asia). Can I download the DLCs with my asia psn account or must I set up US psn account?
As long as the DLCs are available in your local store you can get them, easiest way to tell is loging in with your ps3 and entering the playstation store from there, check if the DLCs for the game are available there (price is always in US dollars no matter your location), if they're available you shouldn't have any problem, i had a US account which i set when i got my ps3, when i wanted to buy Harley's revenge DLC i got a psn card and surprise! it only was good in my country so i had to create a local account and buy it there, then i played on my US account which had all my trophies : ) an even easier solution: get the Game of the Year Edition that has all currently available DLCs in one disc. Since the announcement of Arkham Knight and with Origins already on the market it's not really likely there will be any more DLCs for this game.
Does this game have an option for skill level? Can it be played on "easy" or "beginner" for instance?
Yes this game does have a diffulty option before you start.
Will this game play on PS4?
No it won't. Ps3 games don't run in ps4 consoles.
I bought this game, and comes without a code for Harley Queen's Revenge, is this normal?, or I'm doing something wrong?
Probably the game is used and thats why you dont have it. But if the game is new.... it should have come inside the box. You gotta have a piece of paper with a code on it. If not... contact the seller.
I didn't receive a code to download the bonus content. How can I get this content?
Easy, all the dlc content is on the disc. All u need is Internet access and a psn id and your good to go &#9786;
Is internet connection required to play this game?
No only for download content :-)
Why does the cover say "Internet connection required"? I might gift this to someone and I don't know if his PS3 has an internet connection or not.
Yes
does it come with the Catwoman Pack, Robin Bundle Pack, Nightwing Bundle Pack, Arkham City Skins Pack and Challenge Map Pack
Yes
Can you change the cherry mx keys out? I'd rather have brown D:
Maybe, but I would rather sell my old keyboard then buy cherry brown keyboard
Per answer 3, description says blue switches &amp; fully LED back lit. Are the keys back lit BLUE? THE DESCRIPTION SAYS YES
The backlight is red.
is this keyboard audible? like, can i hear the key when i type? (getting the cherry mx blue)
It is i would say. I got the red as well but you only hear a thump, while this has a mechanical metal like click. I wish I could compare it to my IBM m though side by side. Other than going unicomp, mx blue seem like the only alternative
Compatibility chart does not list Windows 8, is this compatible?
I use this keyboard with Windows 8, and it works fine, software and all.
I wanted to find out, is the blue switch keyboard BLUE led? they are showing red, it doesn't say on the description.
Sorry to disappoint, the LEDs aren't Blue - however, one of their other products, the CM Storm QuickFire TK, has a blue LED/keyswitch combo, as shown in the description. I hope I helped you. I haven't used that keyboard, but by the quality of the Trigger, I think the Quickfire TK shouldn't disappoint. Apologies if I sound like a salesman! :P
Obviously for adults but what age would you recommend in youth?
Good for youth very realistic I have an 11 year old who now knows how a real airplane flys and has been inspired to learn how to fly. Highly recomend
I have Yosemite, does anyone know if the yolk and throttles will work or only the joy stick?
Yes
Does North America scenery include Hawaii?
Yes it does.
does it work with windows 8
From the reviews I've read - yes. However I've had no experience in that arena since I am iMac based. Sorry I can't be of more help.
Does it come on a CD or how do I load if I don't have a CD Drive?
It does come on a cd, and only on a cd
What brand and model of joystick would you recommend with this game? i.e. for MAC. All the ones I've been finding are for PC.
I bought the one that was recommended on the Xplane site at the time. It has some minor issues. Check some gaming sites and ask there.
hi. i have macbook air 2012. can i play this game well on my macbook?
i have an earlier macbook pro and play X-plane 10 on it. I don't see any reason why not.
Does this work on mac'c OS Yosemite ? And is additional h/w required such as a joystick ?
It would work better with a joystick. Works on Yosemite too
will it work on my old old mackbook from may 2006 or is it to old
X Plane 10 may work with your MacBook May, 2006, but it will not be capable to utilize all the programs within X Plane 10. I have been an X Plane user since the old 7.5 days. You will find that X Plane 9 will work well (It did on my MacBook November 2006). However, X Plane 10 was largely a disaster. I recently bought a new iMac with 8 MB of ram and a very fast video card and X Plane works great. Fast, smooth and great graphics with Super Retina Display Hope this is helpful. Happy flying
Is X-Plane 10 Regional: North America - Mac the same exact game as the Global version except for the scenery?
I'm pretty sure it is
Is this a digital version? or a hard copy?
Hard copy and code for play online
Was this new copy supposed to include an online pass voucher?
If you bought it brand new then yes...idk about pre owned......but my did come with an online pass
the pass online doesn`t work bro :/ the game is in very good conditions but i need the pass online :/ please help i really need this
These are used games so the pass has been used, mine has been used too I was disappointed but the price for the game is okay
can you play on multiplayer offline? like with my brother and a 2nd controller? or only online multiplay
Just online
It is in Spanish or English ?
English
Is this game have Chinese sub?
No
This game is coming brings Spanish or Spanish subtitle is?
El juego viene en espaol The game come in spoken spanish
this game is in spanish?
The game audio is in English. There is an option to change the game text to Spanish, but I don't think it affects the audio. I would imagine if you turned on the Spanish text and enabled subtitles, you would be ok.
whats the diffrence between collector edition and standard edition , is it the action figure?
It's amazing you need to ask since it's clearly listed with the collector's edition listing: Exclusive 6" Kratos statue Premium steelbook case Official game soundtrack (digital version) PS3 dynamic theme PSN avatar pack Multiplayer XP Boost Unlock Pass for future DLC content
I have a desktop windows 7 thats been upgraded from XP will this game work on it?
I was able to run it on Win7 Pro 64bit. Didn't require any compatibility changes or the Administrator option. Though I don't know the specs of your system, when I was playing it I had a 3.4 ghz AMD quad core, Nvidia GTX 560 Ti, and 8 gbs of 1600mhz DDR3 ram. Best answer for you: it is diffinently possible. Cheers, Matthew
can you play this game without the internet and do you get disc &amp; software package for disc?
You have to have internet to download and install the game and updates. The game does not come with disk or packaging, but can only be redeemed through a Steam Application code.
Does this game run on Windows 8 64bit?
Yes. That is what I have and it runs just fine. A good video card is a plus.
Can I play this game on Win8?
Of Course it can
Does it support a Xbox 360 controller while playing on a pc?
Yes
what is this code guys? can i or not play this game on my windows 7 desktop
The code is to use the game on a steam account. I believe steam is free to downlaod. Got this for my son.
Could it Run with Intel UMA?
It certainly can. Intel UMA is really just a fancy term for saying that your graphics system uses the system RAM rather than having its own dedicated memory for graphic rendering. That said, a stand-alone graphics card with its own dedicated (faster) onboard memory will give you better results. It depends on the level of detail and performance you are hoping to achieve but purchasing a reasonably low cost graphics card +/- $100 could drastically improve your gaming experience with this and all games like it.
will it run on windows 8 hitman absolution
Yes. This game is an online code so you need steam account and steam to play it.
I have a desktop windows 7 thats been upgraded from XP will this game work on it?
I was able to run it on Win7 Pro 64bit. Didn't require any compatibility changes or the Administrator option. Though I don't know the specs of your system, when I was playing it I had a 3.4 ghz AMD quad core, Nvidia GTX 560 Ti, and 8 gbs of 1600mhz DDR3 ram. Best answer for you: it is diffinently possible.

Will it work with an old wired controller?
The shell won't but the buttons and some trimming will. The wired and wireless shells are very different. Edit: actually the faceplate of the shell may fit but I am not certain as I don't own a wired but the back plat definitely won't
Does it come with the triggers?
Yes, it comes with everything but the electronics.
Do the screws from my original case fit or do I have to buy new screws?
Yes they fit. Is the exact same controller except for the Home button which is different color and doesnt have the X on it.
Will this product fit controllers with the transforming D-Pad?
As far as I know it only works with the X box 360 controllers but I would at least try it in your case.
Can this mouse be used for autocad?
I never used this software, but yes it can. I make youtube videos (Gammby5874) and I have a review of this mouse which will help you in case you don't understand this: You can make different profiles/maps for different programs. You can make one for Autocad and bind the mouse to different keystrokes. Say there is a shortcut for something that uses "P" frequently, but that is always out of the way, you can make it so that one of the mouse buttons is that letter. OR you can make it a more advanced binding. Like I said I don't use that, but this mose is WAY more than just an MMO gaming mouse. It has tons of other functionalities.
Can this be used on a laptop and a stationary PC
Yes for both, but the cord may not be long enough to hook up to the tower on your PC, depending on where you place your tower.
can you program the buttons to be used as any key? or just numbers?
Any key even commands(crtl+s). But yeah any key!
can this mouse make macros for GW2?
I don't think so, sadly. I mean, you can map custom keys to the 1-12 buttons, but you can't make macros with the mouse. If you wanted, you could, say, have the "=" key on your keyboard press 1, 2, and 3 on the keyboard (You'd have to configure the macro in-game, if GW2 doesn't have macros, then you'll need a keyboard with programmable keys or a 3rd party program or something), then in Razer Synapse, you could make button 1-12 act as the "-" key, I believe.
What is warranty for this item and how is it handled, if necessary.
All razor products have different warranties. Wired mice have a two year warranty as long as you have proof that you purchased it. Here is the link that gives all the information needed on razor warranties: http://www.razerzone.com/warranty On the website it says to go to www.razersupport.com to get support for the warranty if you need it. I hope this helps
Do the Naga drivers work with Windows 8.1
I didn't installed the naga specific drivers, but the plug'n'play one works fine, and simulates a number pressing on the side buttons.
length
I will have to check with my son. He is the one that use that mouse. Or you can e-mail him cedricsalvador23@yahoo.com
is it quiet
Well the mouse itself doesn't make any noise, of course it does while moving it. But compared to my other mouses before, I'd say it's quiet, yes.
Does anyone know what is different between the 2012 and the Epic Naga?
From what I can see they moved the extra 2 buttons from left of the left mouse to below the mousewheel. Only has green LEDs and you are forced to use the new Synapse drivers/app. I'm thinking of picking one of these up with discounts for $40 and then reselling to get an original or Molten for stand alone drivers.
Had a Razer Naga MMO mouse...it died after a year. Any suggestions on what should I buy from Logitech to replace it?
Logitech G600 is a similar model, but I didn't used it, so I don't nothing to say about it.
Isn't this game now allowed to be offline (which was the main criticism)?
Before an update that happened last month. The game had to be connect to Internet in order to play ( with a server, which you couldn't always connect to). So you needed internet and hope a server had enough room for you. Now is completely fine. And I'm not sure if when you purchase the cd for the game if it still requires an account with origin.com. If you do digital download like i did, you need to create an origin account and insert a code in order to download. So long story short, you can now play offline. Anytime, anywhere.
If i buy this off of Amazon can I play multiplayer with friends who buy it through EA?
Yes
i am little confused by all these negetive reviews, can any one confirm if i can play this game offline as on today?
Yes, you can play offline now. Still plenty of bugs that will likely never be fixed but the game is playable and fun.
So I should buy Cities: Skylines instead?
I would wait to see the reviews of it after it's released then compare to Simcity.
Will this game work with Windows 8.1?
Yes. I am currently running on a Windows 8.1
How can I be sure I have a version that will let me play off-line. Mine still says on the box that "persistent internet connection required"
They made off-line play available after the initial release. Every version should be able to play off-line now.
I am looking to gift this for a friend. Will I get a CD Key when I purchase this or will it just give me a download?
You will get a key.
My 10 yr old wants to play this game, but he doesnt have an e-mail address... does he need one to play this game?
You need one to sign in to origin. There is an offline mode though. I am not sure that he will have fun with it. I haven't played it in some time due to difficulty with new interface. Simcity 4 if you want fun.
I bought the Standard Edition,where am I suppose to download the game,the download link seems leads to an html file.
If you downloaded it from amazon, you will need to download the origin "app" onto your computer. Once downloaded create an account with origin and register your product key with it and it will open right up
Are the reviews true? Did EA destroy the Sim City franchise in the same manner they destroyed my beloved Command &amp; Conquer?
The game has been changed dramatically. Depending on what you liked in the game may lead to disappointment. With that being said, I may not have liked the game,but that was mainly because of my own expectations.you may find that the game is actually quite good. I simply want a beautified and modernized simcity 4...but others may want something different. What I will say is this, don't read the reviews, watch the videos of the game play and decide for yourself. It is true that companies can ruin games or franchises that we love, but everyone is different. I wish you luck and I really hope that you can find a.product that you.rnjoy as much as simcity for myself and command and conquer for you.

In terms of the story line, will everything still make sense if I haven't played Persona 1, 2, or 3?
The whole series is one giant story, but the connections aren't that relevant. Each game has their own story and set of characters. There are references/cameos that you wouldn't get unless you've played the previous games, but this won't hinder your experience at all.
Is this a code for downloading or a game card?
This is a game card
Is everything from the PS2 version intact?
chie's va was changed and in my opinion still not great but a huge improvement,other than that there are just additions, more events, chance to improve social links at night, couple of new social links, new personas and a new dungeon, i do have to point that the difficulty at normal felt easier than in the ps2 version, and hard was, well, too hard, so if you enjoy moderate challenge keep that in mind.
Is this game cartridge working for non-US psVitas like Mexico ones? Thanks! :)
Yes
does this game have a setting where i can have japanese dialogue but english subtitles?
Unfortunately, no.
is this in English speaking when played? or English subtitles?
The spoken dialogue is in English. The characters still have Japanese names such as "Yosuke Hanamura", but all the dialogue is in ENglish.
is it region free?
It's the English version of the game. So, yes.
Does this game offer the ability to play online with other psp vita persona 4 owners?
As far as I know, no. There are online features such as seeing what others are doing at your area of the game and news but there are no multiplayer features.
What is the gameplay/cutscene ratio
Heavy game play with minimal but excellent crafted cut scenes
Does the have a tutorial to explain the mechanics?
The game does have a great way of introducing you to the game mechanics. After a short time I felt like I had a good handle of the game.
Do these cases fit the DSi XL?
Yes this one will fit all except the 3dsxl with the brackets that come along with it.
Does anyone know if this fits the "NEW" Nintendo 3ds xl
No
Does this fit the DS XL?
No. It's too narrow for the XL and will not go on it.
does it fit the original ds
No, it doesn't fit the original DS. It does fit a DS lite though....hope that helps you out.
What's the difference between the blue triple armor and the other blue nerf case?
The tripple armor has extra plastic cases to protect your DS more and the blue nerf case is just the case itself without the extra armor like the triple
Can this case be used for the DS Lite system?
I don't know and I would hate to tell it could.
If the hinge on the DS is already broken, will the nerf hold it in place?
It looks like it will because from looking at mine, the case snaps together and the DS just lays in it.
I just want to confirm this works with the regular nintendo 3ds?
Not sure what you mean by "regular". I bought my grandson an Nintendo 3ds for Christmas and this cover fit just fine.
Hello I have an original DS, not lite or DSi nor XL. It says simply DS. I want to know if this will fit my unit please.
We have DSi, it fits. Not sure the difference in size between DS and DSi, it does come with attachments to make it fit different DS's.

how can I make the gamepad vibrate, I do not get into settings
I just play fifa with it. Dont think it vibrates.
The controller won't turn on itself if I unplug the usb cord. Is there a possibility of having a battery problem?
I assume that tried charging it for extended periods of time with no success? I can only assume that you have a faulty product, since I haven't run into that issue yet and it can play for several before needing to charge it.
I am confused of plug and play. If the controller cannot turn on without having it plugged in, what's the point of having a rechargeable battery?
The controller can turn on by itself..you only plug in the reciever
How do you turn it on after unplugging the usb?
you still have to plug in the USB-drive-shape connector, then just push the "analog" button in the middle of the gamepad, it will turn on.
Does this charging stand come with 4 rechargeable battery packs, or do they need to be purchases separately?
You need to purchase the charging packs separately.
what kind of batteries do I need for this charging base?
It came with rechargeable batteries.
mine blinks red when I plug in any controllers. What does this mean.
That it is charging my turns blue when they are done.
what kind of batteries do I need for this charging base?
You need the charge pack. Not batteries.
what kind of batteries do I need for this charging base?
The base itself plugs into the wall. In the controllers You can use any rechargeable battery with the normal battery pack holder that comes standard with the controller, or you can use the aftermarket tyco rechargeable battery packs which is what i use. Btw i have had this charger for over a year now and i love it. No technical problems at all. Lights red while charging then cool blue when done. Individual light for ea. controller. Very cool at nite. Hope this helped. Chance M.
what kind of batteries do I need for this charging base?
It works with any xbox 360 rechargeable batteries. I got two of the 2 packs sold by amazon. The charger and the batteries work beautifully! We were spending a fortune on AA batteries.
what kind of batteries do I need for this charging base?
None. It plugs into a wall. But do not charge your controllers if you are using AA battery, battery packs.
does this come with the rechargable batteris?
No

will it work on a mac?
Yes, it works perfectly on a Mac. I tried it with OpenEmu which allows you to map the buttons. I only have the three button controller to test, though.
Is this compatible with games on Steam? Also, why might this not be registering a functional Genesis controller in either port? I'm running 64 bit Windows Vista.
In regards to steam, it is functional if the game supports generic controllers. Many steam games when they say controller support, they only mean XBOX 360 controller support. So it really depends on the game. For instance I played rogue legacy with a sega saturn adapter and SS controller, and it worked great. The game Fez however had a number of problems regsitering other controllers than an xbox 360 one. As far as not registering, I couldn't say. I am running x64 windows 7 which in terms of driver support is usually identical, and I had no problems just plugging it in and having it detected as USB Genesis controller or something like that under devices and printers.
I know this is for Genesis, but would it also work with Sega Master System controllers as well? don't both the controllers have the same plug-in type?
Yes it will. It will also work with Atari controllers
The picture is pretty self explanatory but just want to make sure... This one adaptor supports two controllers, correct?
Yes
I would like to know if there is any lag? I play Ultra Street Fighter IV and a game like that requires quick response time.
i have used mortal kombat on a genesis emulator, which is similar to street fighter. response time is fast and never laggy or unresponsive. however i used the official genesis controller, i don't know about a gamepad
Anyone know if this works on a Raspberry Pi? Or try this out running Linux?
I use it with Linux on a PC, but need to use a special Linux driver available at https://github.com/robmcmullen/hid-atari-retrobit otherwise only the computer only detects two directions from the joystick (down & right).
I tried using this with 2 SMS controllers. on both of them the '2' button did not respond in Windows. and its useless since there is no start button but it says 1 and start are the same..has anyone successfully use a sms controller with this adapter...
I tried mine with genuine Genesis controller and it worked fine
Is It Good
It makes long play sessions more comfortable, and it outlines the back touchpad for less frequent accidental hits. I purchased specifically for comfort while using for remote play (PS4). For less than $3 it is well worth it IMO.
Does this work for the PS Vita 1000 series?
Yes, I have the 1000 series and it fits like a glove.
Does this fit the 2000 series?
I purchased this for my daughter so I'm not sure which one is a 2000 series however I do know she has the original not the slim and it fits perfect
Does this Work with 2000 series?
I don't believe so, but I could be wrong.
subscription?
It will no longer be a subscription based game as of March 17, 2015. It will be buy-to-play with a cash shop for cosmetic and convenience items, as well as expansions, with an optional subscription.
Is it all strictly PvP or is there some PvE as well?
It's almost all PvE - the PvP is optional.
Is there a,way to play offline
Nope it's an MMO so there is no offline mode.
Why is this $40 for a physical copy and $60 to download?
I think it's just that retailers get more leeway on what to charge for boxes, whereas the digital download price is set by the manufacturer. You'll see the same thing all the time with books. The hard copy will come out for like $20 with a $15 digital download and then a few months later you can get the hard copy for $12 and the digital download is still $15. Amazon could cut the price of the book but not the digital version.
What is the difference between this one and Skyrim?
This is an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online). You will be in the world with other real people. Sometimes, it can be a good thing or a bad thing. Most of the mechanics are the same as Skyrim. In ESO, you can do PvP (Player vs. Player), where you fight against real people and not just NPCs (or AI). You cannot do PvP in Skyrim. And, for ESO, you have to pay a subscription fee of $15/month on top of the MSRP $60 for the game to purchase. ESO is an MMO meaning it can potentially go forever, whereas Skyrim had an end!
Does the game come with the typical initial 1st month free?
yes
Is this a physical disc, (for those of us that don't have the fastest dsl, in which the download would take a day)?
It's a number of discs for installation. But I'm not sure, at least for pc, if they're selling them with the new free to play. Haven't seen it at Wal-Mart in a month. But if they do it gives an activation code so you can play the game
On a MMO stance how good is the game? (Pros, Cons, Worth trying?, Worth Subscribing?, Good online encounters?, Fun for how long?)
Hi Nate, Yes ESO is most definitely worth trying. The community of players is very nice and friendly, so if you ever need help with something there will pretty much always be someone there to help you out. I think that once you play it for a few weeks you'll pretty much be ready to make the long term subscribe decision on your own. You need to set up subscription in order to play initially, but you get the first 30 days free regardless and you can cancel your sub before you get charged. The game, for me at least, was immensely fun and engaging for the first 2 months. Once you play through the main story line and go through each factions area, the engagement feeling drops off a bit. But at that point the game becomes less story based and almost strictly pvp based. The crafting and trade systems are wonderful and fun. My advice to any new players is to look for a trading guild the second you hit level 10. it will make your life much easier. The random encounters are fun when they happen, but i didn't see them happening too often, hopefully they will make them more frequent. tl;dr definitely try it, lots of initial fun, late game fun is an 'acquired taste'. Subscription worthy is only up to you.
Is this the physical version or the cd-key version? I would like to purchase the box version if possible.
This is the boxed version.
Is this key redeemable on steam?
No it doesn't run through steam
Is this a recharge remote controller or does it use like regular batteries???
It recharges like any other PS3 Controller
it weight really 5 pounds?
nope not even close and not recommended for any sort of shooter
Anyone have an instruction manual or bluetooth pairing guidance? Thanks
No , also it is not working sice the first two weeks . Mother board fail
Would this controller work for my laptop that has Windows 8.1? If not do you have any suggestions of a controller that will?
I would get a dongle and connect your ps3 or xbox 360 controller instead
Does the turbo work fine in call of duty?
Yeah it works great, if you have the lights on the battery just dies faster. Other than that I love it.
What kind of features does this turbo controller have?
Analog sticks that are too tall. I never use it. Looks really cool, but the turbo isn't really turbo. Rather an auto-fire. Does not seem to increase speed. But I have not tried on all games.
Is this controller also a mic?
No is just a controller is been almost a year and still works great
can i turn on and off the rapid fire?
Yes, the turbo button toggles it.
what are dead spots
Haven't found any,played almost 30 games with it so far.
is their rapid fire
Yes but it isn't great and there is no indication when it is on. I wouldn't buy it for the rapid fire option.
I'm very interested but What does [Driver Update] mean? Is this just a driver update purchase? Won't I get the actual Hardware?
You will receive the actual mouse, the Driver Update means for people who have bought it there is an addition driver update from the one on the disk, on there website. You will receive the mouse, a cd, and a manual. You can then go to there website to download the updated drivers.
Hi, i dont understood if thisa mouse had wheel tilting or not, i rly hope there is no tilt wheel function. i hate it on my precision mx.. if i need to
By tilt, you mean two additional click types by moving the mouse wheel to the left or right? No, The mousewheel doesn't have that functionality. Just center click, and the scroll.
im quiting razer products they just broke after a few months after use, is this mouse better?
I have had the mouse for over a year. i throw it around, keep it in my back pack under textbooks knocking around quit a bit. this mouse is sturdy as can be, as light of as heavy as you want because you can change the weight, and is great for gaming or just web browsing. it was built to last and will do just that. not to mention you can change the led colors!
Though Mac is not listed as a supported operating system, would the non-primary buttons and the DPI settings work on OS X?
I bought one for a mac, and it seemed to work fine when I was just using regular applications (the DPI settings are changeable as they are built into the mouse) and I got all of the non-primary buttons to work using USBOverdrive (you can assign any button to do anything). Now if you are actually gonna use it for games on your mac, don't get it. Whenever I started a game (any game with the exception of Minecraft) with the mouse plugged in, my mac froze unless I was in bootcamp (windows 7). I had to send it back, and the Perixx customer support said they will be releasing drivers for OSX soon and to rebuy it when that happens.
Does this mouse have "free-scrolling" capabilities like some of the Logitech line?
No, not to my knowledge. I purchased this mouse on behalf of a friend. I also researched youtube.com for reviews. My current mouse is "Logitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX". it has free-scrolling.
How much does this mouse way and how much do each gram of steel weigh?
Net weight 5.00 oz. with weight it is 6.03 oz
I don't have a disk drive in my computer (iMac) would windows 7 find the drivers automatically? I already bought, it's in the mail.
Yes, it should work fine. You can also download the software from the manufacturers website.
Does this mouse have a "Sniper" Function? IE..can you lower the DPI by pressing a button, then release it and go back to your normal DPI?
Yes, just behind the scroll wheel is a spring slider for you to turn up or down the DPI. I personally leave the DPI alone at about half of its max. You can also configure the buttons to have a sniper zoom function like for world of tanks I have the left thumb button set up for me to quickly toggle into and out of sniper mode. The buttons can also be changed to have a simple toggle set to change between 2 DPI settings if the DPI button is insufficient.
Does the config software allow you to map CTRL, ALT, or FN to any of the mouse buttons? Sharkk allows it, but the Etekcity doesn't recognize them.
The software is really nice and allows a lot of flexibility. You can assign CTRL and ALT however the FN is not map-able, at least not with my tests.
My window 8 laptop does not have a cd drive, would still be able to install all the necessary drivers and software
My Alienware has a cd drive but the mouse comes with one of those little cds...I went to google and searched for Perixx MX-2000IIB software and found it and downloaded it and it works perfect.
Does this really work with OSX 10.9.5? I bought games recently and they wouldn't work on this operating system. It was a pain to try to get my money
It works but I went from PC Hoyle to Mac and do not like it and they have removed a lot of games.
what games are on the disc?
Black Jack, Bridge, Canasta, Crazy Eights, Cribbage, Euchre, Gin, Go Fish, Hearts, Memory Match, Miami Solitaire, Old Maid, Pinocle, Pitch, Poker, Rummy 500, Skat, Solitare, Space Race, Spade, Spite and Malice, Space Race, Tarot, Tuxedo, Video Blackjack, Video Poker, Video Texas Hold'em and War
what games are included?
Lots, including Spades, Bridge, Hearts, Spite, GoFish, and about 20 types of Solotaire, plus many others
does this work on mac 10.9 Maverick
Yes it does. I have problems getting it to load. When I click on the regular icon it just wants to install the program over and over. I have to go into Finder and Applications to find the right icon to get the games started. (Maybe that is my ignorance?) Once I have it loaded, the games play with no problem.
Can this game be installed on more than one computer if I own them both?
I have an iMac and a Macbook and had to buy a game for each computer. In both cases I did not have a disc. I downloaded the game from Amazon. I imagine the game is too old to be able to find it on disc....and even then, I don't know if a single disc cold provide the game for multiplr computers. It is a good game, Chuck
Does this software work with new operating system Maverick
I don't have Maverick...works well with OSX

Does this controller work with PC also?
No it does not it's exclusively for xbox 360
How is the Flight Stick connected to Xbox 360?
USB CABLE
Does this come with a model plane? because the picture makes it look like that.
It's not a model plane... it's a plane unlock in the game. Don't waste your money on this game... it's really not that good. The stick is not too bad yet not the best I've used. If you find really cheap then might be worth it.
does this flight stick work with all other flying games on xbox 360?
The buttons will work as a controller, but you may have to reconfigure other games button assignments if they do not match Damage Inc.
Does it work with other WWII games like Birds of Steel and IL 2 Sturmovik?
yes I have all those games and it works with them all and more and buy the way good choice of games man!!gamer omac1962.
is this wireless
No, it has a wire. It's long about 8-15 feet though.
Can the joystick be used with other games like HAWX or Ace Combat?
Yes it can.
Can the joystick be used for XBOX 360 shooting games like Halo?
Yes
Is this controller compatible with Windows PC?
I THINK I REMEMBER that there is a stick you can order for the PC for 59.99 or .95 something like that so I don't know if this one will work or not. I know it works on my 360 and not on ps3 or 4s.
If you have to utilize this as plug and play (i.e. not able to use the downloadable software), what are the 12 thumbs buttons set to as the default?
They're set to 1-0, -, and =. the g-shift key makes them act as ctrl+those same buttons. The mouse's on board memory also allows these buttons to be changed via the software on one system, but the mouse itself will remember the changes so that you may plug and play on another system with your changed button layout.
What is the texture like on this mouse? Is it slick like Razer mice, or lightly textured like most other mice?
For the most part it is not textured. It has a sort of matte paint feel, kind of like gamepads (xbox 360, ps3). On the right side of the mouse it is textured with a rubber material to help you keep your grip.
Are the buttons fully programmable for things besides games? ie copy/paste ctrl+w etc
They are prgramable with the ability to do more then one button at a time so you could program Ctrl+c to copy as a button. Only problem I had was making the shift key function as a programble button such as Ctrl but you can program the shift functions and it works with shift key then.
Does it have any clicking issues that happen to it?
All of the buttons are amazingly responsive. The only issue I have with the mouse is that there's no place to rest your thumb other than a button, so when you "white-knuckle" the mouse during combat, you may unintentionally hit a thumb button. The thumb buttons are angled so you can easily identify without looking down which button your thumb is resting on. The Naga Razor doesn't have this feature. All the buttons on the Naga are flush, so you have to look to see where your thumb is.
Can you use fingertip or claw grip with this mouse?
You can, but it's probably going to be a bit less effective than a grip that doesn't rely heavily on the thumb for movement. I have no idea how I played MMOs before this mouse. It even has massive utility for the FPS games I play. I would change my grip style to use it & never look back. :)
I'm curious about the buttons behind the scroll wheel. In some images one of them is raised and in others they're not. Are they normal buttons?
Well the one on the top is to mode switch and the one that is raised up is an extra button. the mouse is awesome trust me.
Why is the white mouse $20 more than the black mouse?
As far as I have been able to find out with light research, Logitech is probably trying to get more money for the same product just different color and call it a special. I doubt the cost is actually increased or any real reason beyond that. I personally wouldn't want a white mouse though, simply because black hides dirt and grime better. But a white mouse would probably prompt more frequent cleanings.
White mouse gets dirty more than black?
Yes
White mouse made from the same type of plastic as black?
yes
Does it work with Mac OS? There are Contradicting statements in amazon and logitech websites.
Yes it works fine in Mac Os, but you need to download the drivers from logitech page: http://www.logitech.com/support/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse
Anybody but me use gaming mice for non-game stuff?
Yes. I use it along with a G13 for AutoCAD at work. Having enter, esc, del, bksp, undo, redo, & other commands always available is a great addition. Honestly, I game at home, but I make better use of the G buttons with productivity software than I ever have in the games (not that I don't use them for those too). For repetitive, command intensive software, programmable keys are the way to go.
Is this mouse ok for smaller hands? Mine are, and though it's hard to tell from the photos, it looks rather large...
Measuring the bottom it's 4x3. It doesn't seem much larger than the average mouse but it's higher. The side buttons are very small. I have medium size female hands and it's about perfect for me. Also it is very sensitive and for the top regular right/left click buttons you can press really far back on them and still have them work so it should be fine.
Did they iron out the firmware on this mouse, eliminating the weird motion skipping it suffered from?
If you have a G600 producted prior to Oct 2012 you will not be able to update the firmware on the mouse. You will be stuck with firmware 77.00.12. If you call Customer support, and have some time, they should be able to offer you a resolution. I battled with the spazzing and skipping of the mouse sicne I got i. I thought maybe it was my mouse pad, so I got a new mouse pad after cleanign the lens of the mouse. Still it continued. After i built a new rig, the sam e problem continuied to occur. I was able to finally find out that it was due to me being an early adopter for the mouse and that I would need to get a new produced mouse so I can perform updates.
Are all the buttons fully reprogrammable, particularly the ring finger button?
Every single button can be reprogrammed aside from the dpi and mode switch buttons.
Does the second right click get in the way a lot?
I thought it would at first but it never has
Is it good for shooters? I really like it, but im not a big mmorpg player. So, is it good for shooters?
It helps. Being able to switch weapons in a bind and using the g shift button to temporarily lower the sensitivity when sniping and instantly go back to normal sensitivity is nice. This is the best mouse I've ever used. Feels great works great and will last for a long time.
Are the buttons too close together for your thumb to accurately hit? It seems with 4 rows of keys it might be easy to hit multiple at the same time.
No, they are well enough apart that they are easily pushed separately but it does take time to get used to it.
USB 3.0 Compatable?
Yes it is. Just tested it now :D
I often switch between a palm grip and a claw grip depending on what I'm doing. Is this mouse only suited for one style of grip preference or not?
claw grip is problematic because it becomes too easy to press a thumb key. they really need a raised fix ridge or ridges running between rows of keys so you can grip something with your thumb without also pressing a key Personally using this and the razer naga has caused a RSI with my thumb specifically because of having to lock it in a weird position to just to keep from pressing a thumb key
Does this mouse work well with Macs?
I'm not sure; I bought this mouse for a Windows PC. It works great for Windows PC though.
will this work in South America?
That depends on your gaming system. You might have to ask Nintendo. I thought all gaming systems were the same not like DVD players.
Is Just Dance 4 also known as Just Dance 2013? Some one wished for this game for this holiday. I am not familiar with WII or this game, so asking.
I don't know. I do know that Just dance 4 has a copyright year if 2012 printed on the disc. It could still be what your wisher wants. I'm sorry I can't be more help
what different between Just Dance 4 and Just Dance 2015
Just Dance 2015 was for our grandkids at Christmas. I did get a chance to do some of the video with the kids then. 2015 has a lot more of the newer songs and has a lot of new dance moves. With the three granddaughters it is important they keep up with all the latest moves. I am having a lot of fun learning with them. I am in a jazzercise class so these videos are a great help. Hope that helps you. Pinky
will it work in europe?
I don't know. You might want to contact Nintendo and ask if the U.S. programs are compatible with Europe.
Do you have to buy another wii remote if you have another player?
The short answer is yes. We already had two controllers for both my boys. But if you really want to, uh, Just Dance... you can just stand behind the kids with remotes and dance along with them! My wife and I you got just as much benefit... And it's just as fun. True, you just don't get to keep track of your score or how perfect you matched the moves.
I want to use this with a group of girls. Do I need a remote controller for each of them or can they just follow the choreographer on the screen?
You can have up to 4 girls dancing at one time. Yes you need a remote for each of them if you want to record their score and see who wins. If they just want to dance for fun then they can all dance by just following the person on screen. Either ways are fun. Hope I answered your question! Happy dancing!
Does this game requires video controller or the Active floor Mat?
It require the Wii remote controller does not need a mat. Just a good set of space to move.
can you use the just dance 4 or just dance 2014 with the dance dace revolution dance mat?
I'm not sure if DDR & Just Dance are compatible. So I can't say for sure.
Where can the "just dance 4" be played? Because I can't play it on DVD/CD player.
A nintendo wii, it is a video game so you need a console
Is it still a little challanging on the easiest difficulty because I have convictoin and it's still pretty challenging
Yes. It also depends on how you go about the missions
how much of the game is stealth or can you go in guns a blazeing
You can play Stealth or go in guns a blazing throughout most of the game, but there are a few stages that must be performed in the stealth mode, just a few. (I love the guns a blazing)
is red box? Greatest hits?
No.
this game have the spanish language o sub?
Yes it does have Spanish language and is not that bad actually
This game have Chinese language or sub?
No
Will it work with the PS motion and the gun adapter?
Hello, good morning. As I have understood the game is not compatible with the PS Move, if so it would indicate in the box the game; like playing Killzone 3 I hope it's helpful. good day
Is this gameplay style similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution?
Not really no, deus ex is a first person role playing game while splinter cell blacklist is an action adventure stealth game. But there are first person shooter type elements in the game with a certain character that you play with in certain missions.
el juego se puede colocar en espa&ntilde;ol?
S
es multilenguaje? se juega en espa&ntilde;ol?
s
The game has subtitles in Spanish
From what I've seen it doesn't have Spanish subtitles. Perhaps in a future update Spanish subtitles will be provided in the game. Your best bet is to enable Spanish from the PS3 crossbar menu.
How's the battery life? How many hours of continuous use?
I have never used it from a full charge down to zero battery, but I have used it for probably about 4 hours without it dying or even a reduction in volume.
How do i plug this pair of headphones To the ps3 so y can speak With my friends(black OPS 2)?
http://youtu.be/PEd5iQlwimc, this shows how to set it up.
IM having trouble i just got it and its not scanning im charging it and scanning it for 1 hour and nothing
I think there's something wrong with that one you received. I think you should send it back.
Does the charging mini-usb cable work for data or is it just for charging? If I can't get the bluetooth to work, can I just plug it into my PS3/PC?
Just charging cant plug it in check your settings on you ps3
can someone tell me if I connect this bluetooth to my ps4
It did not connect with my PS3
Can I use this just as a microphone paired with a Bluetooth speaker for lectures?
I really don't think so since the headset and speakers are usually accesories that will pair with something else eg to a pc a console a car a phone etc, don't think these accesories will pair to one another then again i could be wrong safest bet would be using them both through a laptop.
How do you connect it to the PS3 because mine does not work ?
Same here!! I never figured it out. Other folks were able to get it up and running but I was never able to. So sorry I can't be of any help.
Can it connect to a PC?
It's Bluetooth. So, yeah.
does this work for Mac? if i have bluetooth on my laptop?
It'll work for any bluetooth device it is an universal headset it even works with my car haha
Are you able to mute this easily?
yes
What are the graphics requirements of this game? Will I even be able to play this game without getting a newer graphics card? Thanks
Hi there, I haven't yet installed the the game on my PC as I first need to activate a 'Steam Account' which is a pre requisite apparently. The advice given on the back of the case re video card (presumably one in the same a grahphics card) is: Directx compatible or later with 512MB RAM AMD: ADA RADEON2600XT, 3650 5550, 6450 or higher per series NVIDIA GFORCE8600GT,9500GTGT150, GT1250
These headphones work with PS4
Yes they do, and perfectly I must say! Just plug in the usb dongle into ps4 usb port and turn headphones on and your done, no setting it all up, microphone also picks up really good so people have no problem hearing you talking. There is also an app for ps4 called headset companion app and in that you can choose different sound modes and update the headset as needed. Even if these are more get these over the new PlayStation headphones the new ones are horrible, no bass! And with these elites you can actually plug anything with a headphone jack into the dongle and it will send the audio wirelessly to the headphones, I use them with my cell phone, tv, Xbox one and ps4 wirelessly. And you can also use them like a regular set of headphones with the cable if you need them but forgot to charge them.
does it have a cable just in case the battery dies?
It does come with a 3.5mm jack, which you can connect to the PS4 controller and still hear the audio and chat. The only downside to that is that the features won't work, like the awsome bass.
Pulse elite or gold?
Pulse Elite&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gold.
ps4
headphones work fabulous on ps4
A) Does software work with PS4. (Lower Mic Volume normally) B) How comforable are they?
Most everything works on the PS4. The volume controls are a bit wonky but you'll get used to them in time. The software side doesn't work to lower chat volume and there is no "your voice through speakers" feature like Turtle Beach has. If you play a lot of multiplayer like I do, you'll find a sweet spot and leave it there. As for being comfy? They are quiet comfortable. Of course if you wear glasses you'll eventually get the geek headache from it squeezing them into your domepiece. Otherwise if you wear them without a hat or glasses on, they are comfortable. I've owned headsets from every brand on the market. Turtle Beach is alright but they break easily. Astro is by far too expensive and the company attitude/customer service is vomit worthy. Tritton is just... sad. Logitech and Corsair are awesome but console compatibility is an issue. This headset is actually well built and my favorite I've owned. It has some quirks but it makes up for it in ease of setup. Other headsets require a ton of unsightly cabling.
When using with a PC, are you still getting 7.1 Surround sound? Or is 7.1 only work with Playstation 3/4?
They arent true 7.1... It states virtual 7.1 stereo sound.
Honestly, what headset should I buy? The Pulse Elite, or the Gold Wireless Headset?
If it's honesty you want then there's only one choice The Pulse Elite i have two sets now my Daughter and myself best headset I owned todate, so good my Daughter had me get a set for her. Too many options to list what can be done with them but you will be very pleased. One set is over a year old the other close to a year now..Have not had ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL... And we both game alot WOW, Neverwinter,Diablo3 also Sniper and star craft all work great no flaws at all. So there it is now it's up to you? and those are only a few games I've tried with them good luck..
Does sidetone (hear your own voice) not work on PS4? Any help on the settings if it does.
Yes you can. It has 3 settings Off, Low, High. I will say though on High it's still "low" and you can slightly hear your own voice. Not the best but the sound quality of the headphones makes up for the sidetone quality for me.
How's the wireless range on this thing compare to the gold version?
To be honest, I haven't used the gold headset and i havent been able to test the unobstructed range seeing as how I live in a small house. I do know for a fact that the gold has a better range and battery life seeing as how it's newer. BUUUT in MY opinion, the pulse elites are better because you can make anything with an aux out port wireless. They feel amazing. I had them charging and did a 24 hour game session and i had absolutely no discomfort (as far as the headset goes that is. They will reach through your average wall. I was listening to music from my ps3 in my bathroom that is about 15-20 feet away with to walls. Now I can't say for sure if you will get that kind of reach through the walls at your house or not but that isn't a really big deal. All around I would pick these over the gold anytime. Now don't get me wrong, they're both AMAZING headsets!!
can you hear own voice
Yes, you can. It has sidetone. You have to hold the mute button down for two seconds to switch between low and high sidetone. The sidetone on high sounds very low though.
Are these loose on your head?
No. The headset fits snugly on the head. They're not too tight though.
Is the box in German? Because I'm ordering this from the US, but the image has the box in German. It shouldn't be too much of a problem, just curious.
I don't have the packaging anymore but from looking at the images, it's showing English at very top of each feature and then showing other languages in smaller type underneath. So I think it should be alright. Although to add to this, my microphone part was no longer recognized by Windows even though the headphones still work great.
is this a good headset if i need to hear people calling my name?
With the open foam ear cups, you have very good ambient awareness. Sound quality is very good, although sensitivity is a little low if you try to use these for mobile device.
Does it have a mute button for the mic?
No.
Will these work on the ps4? If not, do I need an adapter?
The Sennheiser PC 310 Gaming Headset has a 3.5mm stereo (a.k.a. 1/8" or "mini") plug and a same size microphone jack/plug...so if that is what size your ps4 requires then this will work. These size plugs are very commom form factor used in many electronics, smartphones, mp3 players, tablet/laptops, clock radios etc
What is the warranty time?
The box says 2 years, but I don't know exactly what sort of problems this warranty covers.
I am wondering if the mic volume is very good or not. I have a cheaper headset and the mic is almost inaudible, even when boosted from the PC
Mic works really well.
Is the sound surround, stereo or mono?
Stereo
Does it work n skype
This works very well, in Skype. The mic is good, and the noise-cancelling doesn't seem to cause any discernible lag, according to those I've asked, since I got this. I don't seem to hear any of those pregnant pauses that seem to plague my cell phone.
Are the ear cups over-the-ear (like ear muffs) or do they sit on top of the ear like earpads?
They are on ear, not bad for sound isolation though.
Is this a USB headset, or does it have 2 x 3.5mm TRS connectors (Audio and Microphone)?
It is a USB headset with 3.5mm connectors for audio and mic.
How good is the mic quality compared to the PC 360's?
I own both headsets and they both use the same technology for the Microphone. I use it to record audio and if I had to choose between the two I would pick the 360 by very close margin. hope this helps. But honestly, you cant go wrong with either headset.
Are these open eared? Will i be able to hear whats going on around me and myself talk? Thanks.
They are considered open ear headphones -- cloth ear cuffs.
Sorry not to ask again, but, I want to get a good idea before making a purchase. Do these feel sturdy or more flimsy?
Sturdy and comfortable, you can wear them for hours and they never get uncomfortable. But certainly sturdy and durable.
Do they feel cheap with them being like all plastic and can people around you hear what you are listening to?
I think they feel like you would expect them to. it's not hollow plastic, so it feels denser, but it is very plasticky. People around you cannot hear what you are listening to. They are "open" in the sense that they aren't noise cancelling as much as one with leather or faux leather are, but they don't allow the speakers to be heard much even if the headset is around your neck.
The 350 SE seem to be relatively Quiet, do these also require an Amp?
They do not require an amplifier. And they also include a USB sound device which powers them such that you will actually need to turn down the analog volume control on the headset to listen at a comfortable level. When the integrated volume control is at full, you should probably set your regular sound card to 20% or so. Or set your sound device to full and turn down the headset.
This or turtle beach xp510 ? Is there differences between these two headsets?
Hardware wise they are the same. Looks and Audio presets are slightly different.
hi this work on mobile ? plz i need fast answer ^^ ty
Yes, you can use Bluetooth or a cocorthst come with
my son has connected and the audio works but they mic wont work it is giving him an error code of 8001009
Kim, Joshua has the best advice and have your son or you follow his instructions. If all fails contact Amazon and let them know the problem and you can get an replacement right away!
Can I use another power source is the usb cable ? i mean use Power adapter supply ? plz fast answer ^^
The Transmitter uses a DC 5v input for power. The USB is used to recharge the battery in the headset, and it is the only way to recharge it that I am aware of. Can you explain your concerns regarding the USB recharging cable?
I have the Headset Adapter that came with another set of Turtle Beach headphones, can I plug these into that for my Xbox One?
I don't know what type of adapter you would need. The Xbox One has digital audio out (optical) that will plug directly into the base station of this headphone setup.
Can I use this on PS4
I don't see why not. It has analog (yellow RCA) plug and digital (optical) plug. I have the TV optical passing thru to the stereo so anything plugged into my TV (DVR, XBOX, DVD) plays thru the headphones without the stereo on.
For PC Users do i need to buy a bluetooth adapter? or can this connect into plain USB? I have evga x58 3-way classified board (which is a usb 2.0)
Yes you will need a Bluetooth adapter for your PC.
Will this Headset work with Xbox One if I have the Microsoft headset adapter? I already have the adapter so it wouldn't be a problem.
yes it should work! i use mine with xbox one but without the adapter.
Is the microphone detachable?
No
Will these work with the new Xbox E console, since the "E" does not have an optical connection?
Yes, unfortunately the E does not have an optical port, so we made a special adapter to use our digital surround sound headsets with the Xbox 360 E. You can only purchase it at our website ... http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/audio-converter-parts/ear-force-hd-audio-converter/421

Does this headset come with the warranty even though it is not purchased directly from TB?
I don't remember seeing anything about a warranty in the box, but I have used mine almost everyday since I bought it and not once have I had any issues with it. Turtle Beach makes really good products, I have three of there headsets and not one has had any issues. I would just register it through the website and if you have any problems contact them about it, I have heard really good things about there customer support.
Has anyone tried using more than one of these in the same room/area? I'm wondering if its possible to daisy chain two together.
Not 100% sure but they are dual band so its possible it would work.
My PS3 has a DAC to my home theater for SurroundSound and an HDMI to my TV for normal sound at night. How do I pair these to get the SurroundSound
The wireless transmitter will pass through digital optical -- it has both an in and out port for optical -- so you should be able to daisy-chain, plugging the transmitter into the PS3, and the DAC into the transmitter.
Are these compatible with the Xbox one
Yes, but you need the Xbox One chat adapter.
Can anyone get this to work on Linux? Output is mono, via pulseaudio; in chats, the other person hears their voice echo.
No. This is a gaming headset.. It's engineered only for games. The sound quality and its chat quality in playstation and Xbox is unbeatable but don't expect it to give you the same results via any other media source
can i hear the game and the people in a xbox party?
No, I would not recommend these particular TB's...
I want to buy it to Portugal. Can you sell it?
no sorry
does it work for xbox360
Yes, works in mine just fine
is it compatible with the ps4
Yes
does it work on PC/Mac? and is this wireless?
Don't know I had bad experience with them

Does anyone know if this work ont he standard WII's?
Yes it does
Is this video game interactive?
Not really, you just follow the dancers on the TV and try to do the same movements as they do; then it gives you a score.
what is the recommended age for this toy?
i purchased this for my 6 year old and 9 year old grand daughters and they love it
Does Anyone know if it workshop in europe as well?
I don't know
Does this game work with WiiU?
Yes it will. All Wii games work with Wii U. We have this and 23 other wii games and use them all on Wii U
do you need to have the dance pad to play this? or does it just use the wii remotes?
Just the remotes, no dance pad needed.

does it contain nudity?
Depends on which game you are playing. No sexual nudity to my knowledge, there is a cut scene (RED6) of a character hatching from an egg and there is a full frontal of a woman. It is quite graffic...so if you are on the fence you might want hold off. Overall I loved the game, but I can understand/respect wanting to make sure.
Does any of the codes have expiration dates?
No they don't expire. If I was able to send you a picture I would of the directions. Buy mine for $60. I think it's cheaper and all the codes are there. I don't have xbox live.
Is this edition fully physical or just download codes?
This edition has both physical discs and download codes. Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil 6 Language Pack and Resident Evil Degeneration are physical discs. Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil Code Veronica X and Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition are download codes.
Do the codes for RE 1-5 have an expiration date?
In fact, No, so go ahead with it...
How are the graphics for Resident Evil 1-3? Did Capcom make them better or do they look like the PS1 versions?
No they were not remastered. You just receive a download code for the game on PSN
Do you need to buy this game new for the downloads to work?
The Download codes come with the game. Which you download from either Xbox Live or PSN. If you already own Resident Evil 1 through 5 from either of the networks, avoid this game. As the game comes with codes to download the games from either of the online services
i wana buy this game, but i want to know if ithe codes will be on line for dowloading the games, until what date will be the games onlie availables?
Yes....
are these the games?
The one i got was only 6 didnt have any other game with it
is this game region locked? if so to which region?
Most of the time if the game was from another country it will state it. Wen i bought mine i just made sure it was from a state in the USA. I wanted the BIO-Hazzard Resident evil but it was only produced in Japan. Most sellers put what region...I looked at the game you are interested in and it looks like it would play in US only. Sorry i wasn't much help.
I would like to know if there is just 1 CD or if the quantity is different, just because I heard there is a version of 3 CD's
It's just 1 disc. Games 1 through 5 are downloadable content only, from the online Playstation store.
How are the graphics for RE 1,2,3? Are they at least like the Game Cube versions?
I've never played the Game Cube versions but I've played the original PlayStation versions and that's exactly what it looks like.
if I buy the anthology on ps3 does it work on ps4?
As far as I know ps4 is not backwards compatible at all. Thats why is you bought call of duty or battle feild 4 you could by it for ps4 for 10 dollars. Either way by it new your getting like 6 games it's worth it if you have a ps3
If this is true, I don't have high speed internet, can anyone download them for me to a memory card or should I give them my console so that they can
You need to give them your console , or tell them to add on an external hdd then transfer it to your console , and it has to be downloaded from your PSN account so you can play it
Will this game play on a Nintendo 2DS.
Yes it will.
I have Nintendo 3DS XL handheld player. Will this New Super Mario Bros 2 play with this console? Thanks. Edit | Delete
Yes it will work. That's what kind my Husband has and it works perfectly :-)
Is it 3D games ???
Yes. It is 3D. But this is a classic side-scroller, so the 3D doesn't make much of an impact. Still plenty of fun though. One of my kid's favorites.
will the game play on a NINTENDO DS LITE
I use the 3ds only for which this game was designed. My guess is it will not.
what is the newest mario for the 3ds
The Most Newest Game with Mario for 3DS is Yoshi's New Island-based on the Super Nintendo Game Yoshi's Island.
will this play on the wii
No
will this game work on DSi XL?
I believe 3ds games have a bump in the cartridge that makes them incompatible with dsi or other previous generation handhelds, so no.
Do Nintendo games come in multiple languages where you can switch say from English to Spanish or French, like you do on DVDs or certain computer apps
I checked my game and it doesn't indicate being able to choose languages. I would suggest you contact Nintendo as their "Help" info is very good and they do respond rather quickly to customer questions.
can you play this on the 2DS?
Yes
Does the game still work if you live in another country? Or does it only work on American 3DS consoles?
The game I bought didn't work in my console (2DS). I bought that one in Spain, I think it shouldn't be an American Console

Can you use Giants on the new SwapForce portal?
You can use old skylanders on new portals but not always vis ver sa.
Are the Jet Vac and the Cynder figures giants too? or are they regular?
They are regular size. Not as big as Tree Rex
can i just use a wiimote controller?
No, you would need the nun chuck with the wiimote.
does the portal work with the ds?
No, it will not work with the ds but will work with the wii U. You have to buy the 3ds starter kit to get the right portal the good news they are completly different games and you get pop fiz with 3ds and of course you can use all the figures on both games.
Do the Skylanders Giants work on an Xbox 360?
The actual figure will work on any platform, but the game needs to be specific to you machine. So you would need to buy the starter pack for an Xbox 360.
Can 2 players play at once, I heard some rumors of these style games not being true multiplayer on the WII (not WII U)
Yes
Will this portal also work with the original Skylanders figures?
Yes
Does this work on a wii that was bought about 6 years ago or have they since updated the wii systems and need to purchase a whole new wii system?
This should work on the wii system with no problem. My grandson has the Skylanders & the Skylanders Giant.
Does the skylanders swap force characters work with this game ?
No....the Skylanders swap force figures do not work on the portal of the Skylander Giants game.
Can you use spyros on the giant portal
Yes you can use any of the Skylanders on the portal.

Does it come with a cable?????
According to the information from Ubisoft on Amazon, it does. If you're purchasing it used, I'd ask. I can understand thinking it wouldn't at that price, but the info says it does.
does it come with guitar?
No.
Does it come whith the Real Tone Cable?
Yes
Does it work on ps4?
No. PS4 cannot play PS3 discs. However, a limited number of PS3 titles are available on PS4 via the PlayStation Now service.
Does it work fine with Bass or is focused only in guitar with some Add-on for Bass, I'm a bass player but I want it to practice and have fun.
Out of the box, this game is solely focused on guitar. You must purchase a digital add on for bass guitar. At the time I purchased the add on it was USD $9.99. That said, the bass feature works great and is a ton of fun. Just be aware that this feature costs extra.
Could one plug in an electric cello or violin and learn them or is it just strictly for the bass and guitar?
The game reads like tablature, not musical notes and therefore is unfortunately guitar and bass specific.
Does this include the USB cable?
It must state it on box. Mine did.
includes version for bass or should I download?
Yeah, it has both guitar and bass options.
is it a two player game
Yes, with two cords, two people can play.
Hi, I just purchased this item. i'm not sure if this game comes with the cable??
If this question has come to me because it's the same one I purchased, rest easy, it will include the cable. Get ready to rock!
Will it work on a Mac?
Hey man, I was Worried bout the same thing, happy to say that it does. You can't use the windows drivers or whatevs, but it shows up in the dolphin controller set up, and you just have to manually set it up, which is easy
Does this work on a Wii U to play the newest Smash Brothers? Can someone Confirm yes or no?
No
windows 8
It does work with Windows 8 and 8.1.
does it work with wireless gamecube controllers?
Yes, I have mine hooked up to a wavebird now :) I can't speak to other wireless models however. But I would imagine they would work the same.
Does anyone know if playing melee at a competetive level is possible with this? I want to start playing dolphin to get better but can I wavedash etc.?
I play project m on it all of the time. You have to play with the configurations on it to emulate a true gc controller. It may not be 1 to 1 accuracy but I think it works well enough for practice if its your only option. Playing on a gamecube or wii would be better if you have it.
Does this have Steam support? Like, would I be able to play most games with this?
if it has controller support it should. use joy2key if not.
Will it work with Smash 4 on the wii u?
No
Will this work with the Wii U?
No it doesn't
Does this adapter work well in Linux?
It's plug and play, I didn't have to do anything other than just plug it into a USB port. Dolphin emulator recognized it right away
What different emulators will this work with?
It's read as a generic input, so any emulator allowing button mapping (which should be all of them) should be compatible.. I used it specifically with dolphin, but should work elsewhere. I don't support emulation, and the only games I emulate are isos I rip off my own discs to play over the Internet Internet with friends.

I play project m on it all of the time. You have to play with the configurations on it to emulate a true gc controller. It may not be 1 to 1 accuracy but I think it works well enough for practice if its your only option. Playing on a gamecube or wii would be better if you have it.
Does this have Steam support? Like, would I be able to play most games with this?
if it has controller support it should. use joy2key if not.
Will it work with Smash 4 on the wii u?
No
Will this work with the Wii U?
No it doesn't
Does this adapter work well in Linux?
It's plug and play, I didn't have to do anything other than just plug it into a USB port. Dolphin emulator recognized it right away
What different emulators will this work with?
It's read as a generic input, so any emulator allowing button mapping (which should be all of them) should be compatible.. I used it specifically with dolphin, but should work elsewhere. I don't support emulation, and the only games I emulate are isos I rip off my own discs to play over the Internet Internet with friends.
I just want to confirm, I want to use my xbox 360 controller on ps3, and I want to use this wireless, this should be no problem right?
As far as I know, the xbox 360 needs to be wired
Can you use a keyboard and mouse with the Xbox360 like the cronus device?
No, this device is only for use with controllers, however it will enable you to use a ps2, ps3, or xbox 360 controller on a PC if you want to. If you check on http://mayflash.com/Products/XBOXXBOX360/MF001.html you can see a diagram about what this adapter will enable you to do, as well as further details. If you are looking for a device to use a mouse and KB with an Xbox 360, you won't find one cheap. I have never seen one for under $40. Mayflash also makes one, called the Max Shooter for Xbox 360, and it's the cheapest I've seen.
Can you use this to connect a wired guitar for xbox 360 to a ps3 to play rockband?
yes, well done, thank you so much !!!
Will this work for PS4? I know it says PS3, but I would like to know before I upgrade to a current gen system.
This is not meant for use with the PS4.
I would like to use a Logitech G27 to play Forza 5 on an XBOX One and this "might" be the ticket. Anybody who has tried this please advise... Thanks.
I don't think it would work. I just tried to get the process started (you need an original wired xbox controller to start) and it didn't work. so more than likely you won't be able to do this, however....google controller max! this might be able to help you or look up chronus max on amazon.
I have a PS3 arcade stick which is getting detected in Win 8.1 64 bit, but the buttons aren't working due to nodrivers. Will this adapter work for me?
U prob is conflict between nvidia chipset and you madcazt stick, but this adapter is fine to solve you problem, or any pci usb2-3 card..
I can't connect the 360-control (wired) and PS3-control (wired) to Xbox 360 simultaneously, any idea of why? after recognizing the PS3 control, the wired-360 is not recognized back.
Once you use the controller the sysgem recognizes the ps3 as that controller and u cant cinnect it again
Will this also work to convert a plain xbox controller to work on a ps3?
no I believe the original xbox controller had a round plug similar to gamecube. there may be an additional adapter to convert to usb but the product in question only has a usb port and a ps2 controller port
can I connect 2 controllers simultaneously? (for instance connect a PS2 and Xbox 360 controller to a PS3)
I'm pretty sure this adapter only supports one controller at a time.
can i use this so i can use a wii u pro controller on a ps3?
Nop there is no way u can use with wiiu pro on a ps3
Is this really worth it? I heard this was the second worst CoD out there! And should I just get the Standard Edition or with 1st DLC collection?
It is the best one
When is the expiration date for the DLC code?
According to Google the expiration date is never really set in stone. MW3 has regular updates so I would just enter it and you will most likely be good to go. I am sure the Playstation Network would make it right they are great at customer service.
the game is in Spanish?? or has this game in Spanish??
Yo lo compre y me vino en inlges, nunca he conseguido ese juego en espaol he botado mi dinero tratando de encontrar uno en espaol
This game comes with the Spanish language?
Negative, everything is in English and not even give you another choice. What's more if you want to sell it is in perfect condition like new. I remain attentive to your comments.
Is the DLC on disc or is it a code?
Andrew, it is exactly the same disc as the normal mw3 except it just has the code to enter to get the dlc. If you have the game already, I suggest you don't buy this because you'll be paying and getting the game again but it's your choice.
the game is in Spanish?
Holla
Whats the dlc collection 1, what contain
Google it :/
Can you change the color of the lights on this, or is it only green?
From what I remember its only green.
Why does my razer taipan has only one laser sensor(8200dpi) while other taipan has the 4G "DUAL" sensor (2 laser sensor) ?
So far as I know, you're talking about two different things. "8200dpi" is the mouse's resolution, and the 4G Dual Sensor System (a laser and an optical sensor, not two lasers) is the sensor package used to achieve that resolution. http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-taipan
if you use the mouse with your right hand can you set the pinky forward and back button to different keybinds then the thumb? huge wow pvper***
Yes they can! All four buttons on both sidesign can be individually reprogrammed to an extent. But in my case, many of the button are not fully reliable. I find myself not clicking as forcefully as I should, thus resulting in the key not registering the action. So no half assed cliclicking!
Does this Razer Taipan have Dual Sensor (two holes, one optical, one laser in the bottom)?
only one optic lazer
Is this mouse good if I do not use claw grip.
i don't use a claw grip and i feel fine with it. I have the Bf4 version of this, so the top is sort of slippery, but the regular taipan has rubber over the center so it clings well to your hand.
Does it have a built in accelertaion that you can't turn off?Like most lazer mice?I find built in acceleration annoying
yes it does. But if you use Razer Synapse you can control the amount of acceleration from 0 to 10.
Is this mouse better for the claw grip?I want to replace my deathadder because it didn't allow me to claw grip very well.
Hey mate, I'm Razer's super fan. I got every type of Razer mouse. Taipan is a good mouse, nice responds and comfortable weight. Just a little bigger than Orochi. But for performance, Taipan is better. I strongly recommend this mouse. If you want a smaller one, Orochi will be a good choice.
Can this go to 400 DPI or lower?
yes it can, anywhere between 100-8200 DPI in increments of 100
size? how is this mouse for profile i like my mice simple High DPI low and flat
It's a very flat mouse. Low profile and long.
Does this mouse have a button to allow the scroll wheel to roll freely?
No
are these games 3 hiden objects system
Sorry. It's is matching same tiles.
does it work on window 7
Yes, no problems.
Will it work with Windows 8.1
I found out that I have Windows 7 and it work for me. So it should work for Windows 8.1
What games on this disc are full versions with no additonal payment required to complete them?
All of the games listed are the complete version with no additional cost. You just choose from the list which ones you want to put on to your computer. They have their first versions of the game (not as good) up to the latest (very good). I have had more fun with that one purchase. It's a GREAT deal!
does this support the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel?
Good day, I have not personally used but I understand that if it works, I recommend the brand to see what map is on PS3
does this support the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel?
Yes, I've been playing with the G27 and had no problems.
Is this the English (U.S.) version of the game or an import?
Yes, this is the English US version...

Is this really only 3 games now? Or will they renew the vouchers for Origins?
If you buy the game new, the voucher is still good until 2016. However, if you buy it used, the voucher may not be included or already used so it can't be used again.
I'm new with the PS3, do I need a PSN account to download Ghost of Sparta and Chains of Olympus?
Yeah but it's free so don't worry about it
Is this a multplayer game?
No, none of the God of war titles in this collection are multiplayer only God of war ascension.
It is in Spanish or English ?
English
So what is this exactly? A disk per game? Everything has to be downloaded? I&acute;d like to know if all of the games are included or not
Hi Alfonso, God of War I & II are Disc One, God of War III is Disc Two. God of War Collection (Chain of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta) are downloadable items.
im seeing people saying chains of olympus and ghost of sparta are psp games? is this true or are the voucher codes for the ps3 version?
They're good for ps3 as well.
I like 20 day came my game but when you enter the Captcha code tells me this expired or was used that happened there
Maybe try again and check your spelling... All of mine worked
I like 20 day came my game but when you enter the Captcha code tells me this expired or was used that happened there
Unless you have a PSN account from USA or Canada then the code will not work.
I'm from Italy. Can i use every game without a US PSN account? (don't answer with just 'no' in case please)
No you'll have to you psn for chains of Olympus and ghost of apart but be carful those two games are like dlc full games but some cases they have already been used so basically you might only get 3 games GOD 1,2,3
hi includes Spanish language?
No
Hi, Is the "Festival of blood" included in this collection? as DVD not on a Voucher? Thanks Naren Turaka.
I ordered the game on Aug. 28th 2014 even though I read a lot of comments mentioning that the dlc voucher is no longer valid (still thought two games for 20 bucks is a good deal even without all the extra stuff). So it was a nice surprise that I was still able to download all the dlc - the "super voucher" that came with it stated "valid 06/15/2014 - 06/17/2017", so maybe now they're shipping out updated vouchers or something.
is the game region free ?
Yes but the download codes will not work in other countries.
Are the cases cardboard or plastic?
Plastic
Is it a free roaming game?
Yes it is
Does this game sold from the Official Amazon, will it include ALL Discs and DLC Codes? Alot of people have been complaining about missing games.
My copy came with everything. And the codes got me another copy of second game and trial of first... dont know if that is how its supposed to be
Are DLC Vouchers still valid as of 5/13/2015 | May 5, 2015?
Hi Don, I'm afraid the DLC vouchers have already been used.
Are the codes still active and working as of April 2015 for the current printing?
Yes they are.
Does this come in a plastic case or cardboard sleeve
Plastic case
Is there a coop mode for 2+ players ?
No but it would be pretty cool
How many CDs are in the Pack?
2 discs (one game on each) and a third game as download content. 3rd game alone is worth the price of the collection in my opinion.
Is this backlit?
Only partially. As shown in the picture, the programmable macro keys are backlit. It's also got a backlit volume wheel.
does it have any warranty? I bought it several months ago, but my W is becoming more and more insensitive..so ..
http://www.aziocorp.com/en/content/11-warranty
Does it have a program to change the macros and stuff
Yes, It comes with software to change the macros.
Is this keyboard really 24" wide?
Yes
What is it made of? Is is plastic or some kind of metal? I am referring to the main chassis
Good firm plastic
How is the key cap quality? How is the surface? is it touching silky or roughly? How is the letter painting on the caps?
Key caps are nice. Not silky like a K 70 but not super rough. My wasd keys are only slightly faded after 1.5 years or so
How long is the USB cable?
I'm not positive but I have mine running from under my desk and through the back of desk and I can sit it in my lap and recline in my big mens chair is say about six feet but I don't have a tape measure
Do the A1 and D1 series keys just not have any default values? I press them and nothing happens.
Correct. If you want something to happen u have to assign it at the azio app
What support is there for Mac OS X?
I do not see any compatibility options for MAC OS online. As a USB 2.0 connection, they are compatible to a certain extent, but are NOT 100% compatible with each other considering the "WIN" function that has programmable keys available with Windows software.
If you put the Numpad on the left side, could someone measure the gap between the "Enter" key and the A/B Macro keys?
2" between those key
what are the graphics card requirements?

I bought the game and downloaded it today. I created an origin account. When I start the game the icon comes and then goes off. I cannot play the game
Make sure you have media player enabled under windows programs.
Does it Work with Windows 8.1? Trabaja bien con W8.1?
it works on Windows 8.0 but haven't tried with 8.1. I assume it should work with 8.1 as well.
can you play it without wifi?
Correct answer is no. The game requires the program Origin in order to run. If you don't have access to the internet, Origin and this FIFA cannot run. You can disconnect the internet after the program is started though.

Does the xbox reset if you switch your tv to cable or something else with these aftermarket adapters. Do you have that problem with this one?.
Nope it's worked fine
Will this work with the xbox 360 pro?
It should work with every xbox 360. I have the newer version. (the slim black with built in wifi) I'm not entirely sure which model is the "pro". The adapter to plug in to the console is the standard component port.
Does the xbox reset if you switch your tv to cable or something else with these aftermarket adapters. Do you have that problem with this one?
The one I bought hasn't done that to me yet. It seems like a pretty quality product.
Can this be played in the English language or subtitles?
Hello. It is Japanese only
Does this contain "explicit" content?
No, the console version doesn't contain any H scenes and a censored "gore" scene.
I received it but the package said it came from Japan. Can I still play it on my American PS3?
Yes you can. There is no problem to use this game on an American ps3.

Does this product play Titan Falls?
Yeah, buddy. Picked up Titanfall and had gotten it the week before for that purpose. Looking forward to being able to play Battlfield 4.
does this work with E 360 slim?
Yes it works perfectly and has not shown any signs of malfunction..
How do you actually make it work??!! What else do you need to install this??!! I purchased two hard drives, and two cables, and none seem to work.
You should not need cables at all. First, you will need to identify the type of xbox you have. If you have a "fat" (curved sides, no vent on side), you purchased the wrong hard drive. If your Xbox is "slim", (angled or straight sides, vent on the side) then you will need to remove the small vent on the side of the Xbox and slide the drive in.
I apologize that I'm not very knowledgeable about the xbox but my concern is that my son won't be able to play any of the games he already has. I'm not sure I understand the comments that people have made about not being able to play the original...
I haven't had that issue, i installed 6 games between new and old games to the HDD and it's working fine. so far so good
Does this work with Destiny?
Sure does. It will ask him when he first starts the game(any game) where he wants to save the data to.
Can you use this hard drive to play Battlefield 4 and Watchdogs? I bought both games and was not able to play them on my slim.
I'm using it for BF4 with no problems. Not sure about Watch Dogs, but it works with all my titles, even GTA V (which requires a hard drive for content installation). Pretty sure you'd have no problems, but if you did you can always use a USB stick alongside it or by itself.
If upgrading from a 250GB HDD to 320 GB HDD, is there a way to transfer all of my info from the first to the second so I won't have to swap them out?
The way im thinking is doing it by clonning software on a pc.
Just a quick question. Does this work on the regular xbox 360? I bought Titanfall and didnt know I needed a harddrive for it, So would this work?
By "regular xbox 360" do you mean the original XBox? This drive is only for the newer 360 S (Slim). This page explains the different storage options depending on the type of XBox you have: http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/storage
xbox live
yes it will work fine
for a xbox 360 slim do i need to buy a 500gb slim or a 500gb and does the 320 work better than the 500
You need the 500gb slim version or you can take apart the regular 500gb one (if you have the right screwdriver). The 320gb and 500gb both work well, it just depends on how much space you need.
Does This Come With A Charger?
Yes. Just watch for disclaimers stating otherwise. All that aside, you buy new, it comes with one. Happy spending!
Can you turn the connectivity off, similar to putting a phone in "airplane mode"?
You can turn off the WiFi connectivity if that's what you mean. There's a button on the side.
is there a warranty
Yeah, but for a year or two so I strongly suggest to get an warranty (Canpoy or Sqauretrade, if offered) so you'll know you're covered in case it gets damaged or spill on.
Will this make my dreams come true?
Believe me, it will make most of your dreams come true. It's that great.
can you use old games that were purchased for a DS and a DSi?
Yes you can. Although you cannot play GBA games, and so with DS games that sometimes have the feature to connect to a GBA game and get goodies, like Harvest Moon DS or Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, you won't be able to do so. Otherwise, you can play the games just fine.
which region this 3ds xl belong?
The U.S
can 3 DS &amp; DS games be played on Nintendo 3DS XL
Yes
What games does it come with?
none. its the system only.
Can i use borrowed 3ds games from my friends?
Sure my grandson is only 7 years old and we buy used games all the time. You can play any type of D's game on this machine.
For anyone that just bought this recently, what's the original firmware version that it came in?
Hello there. The one we have for sale originally came with 4.5 however we may own different releases. Check this site to match your serial number and you may be able to find out which yours came with. http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/3DS_hacking_faq#Can_you_check_the_System_version_before_buying_a_new_3DS.3F
What firmware version does this red/black model ship with?
Mine came with a firmware of 6.2 and I received it on January 10, 2015
Can you watch videos on this?
Netflix is also available on the 3DS.
can it play japanese inported games
Hi there Torey W! Unfortuneately, the 3DS series is completely regionlocked (3DS/i/XL/[2DS]). There are, I believe, three regions - Europe-Australia / Canada-America / Asia. If you buy a 3DS in America, it can only play games from America. If you are interested in buying a Japanese version of the 3DSXL, you'll need to look into buying a 3DSLL, which is the name of the system in Japan. It'll be expensive, but there are so, SO many more colors and combinations that you can buy. That said, it is still possible to interact with people who have different region-locks. Even though my 3DS is American, I can still interact with Japanese and European 3DS' in all ways. I hope this helps!!
does playing a DS game not a 3ds game save power on the system
In my experience as far as power goes they're the same. I've played both from fully charged to no power at all. Neither one is better or worse than the other when comparing power!
Is this hand-held console in English? or is it the japanese version? want to make fully sure, before we click the order now button. Thanks!!
English
When were these 3DS XLs acquired?
I'm not sure I understand you correctly, so, I'll just say that I received my 3DS XL in April of this year(2014).
what over the ear headphones are recommended for an 8 year old?
I would recommend the Sony MDR-222KD Children's Headphones
does the 3dsxl come with a charger?
Yes
Is this like a store bought 3DS XL?
Yes. It is the exact same product from Nintendo as the ones seen in store. Just be sure you are getting the color you want, which will be labeled in the description. The color scheme (ex. red/black) means the lid or top of the DS is red and the bottom portion is black. The lower portion on all 3DS XL's are black unless it is a special edition which it would specify. Hope this answer helps. I love my 3DS XL. Worth the purchase.
good afternoon .. have to change it to Spanish mode
En el menu primo escoja Configuracion de la consola/ entonce Otras opciones/ #4, el primero opcion es Idioma/ escoja la tercera linea- Espanol. From the main menu select System Settings/ Other Settings/ #4- Language/ the third line is Spanish.
Will it work with a New Nintendo 3DS XL?
Yes it should. I don't believe there's been a change in screen size, and this article says so too. http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/12/nintendo-new-3ds-xl-australian-review/
Is this compatible with the New 3DS XL that is coming out?
According to Nintendo the Screen Sizes are exactly the same so you should be fine! http://www.nintendo.com/3ds/features/compare#/compare-3ds
Does it affects the 3D viewing? Does it still looks 3D? I thought 3D depends on lighting or something... Thank you.
No it doesn't affect the 3D.its hardly noticeable that the protector is even on the system at all. Best protector pack you can buy.
Does this help with glare at all? Looking for a screen protector that will allow me to play it outside.
Nope, it doesn't do anything for glare. It has no effect on the screen.
Big important question: Are these removable after they have been used on the devices for a year or so?
Yes
It's only one screed protector filter?
No , Two filters one for the top screen and one for the bottom .
How are they applied?
There are instructions inside that tell you how to apply it without putting your fingers on the backs of the adhesive. Each tab is numbered in an order to apply it. I am sure there are videos on youtube you can consult. Hope this helps.
how many come in the pack?
Enough for 1 3DS XL.
Would this work for the "new" 3ds xl?
Yes it will, I have it on my 3ds xl and it fits perfectly
Does this product have an a and b protective film, like the ones for mobile phones?
He means is the screen protector sandwiched between two disposable layers typically labeled A and B like on mobile phone screen protectors. They're simply for application and you peel them off in steps (sometimes labled as 1 and 2 instead). I don't know the answer, but wanted to help him.
so you have copys of this game on steam? just wondering im really interested in buying this but just want to know what im paying for is it a game key
It's real product package and We will ship out. you need to activate the code through internet and steam account. There might be update for the game.
so why is this game so cheap compared to the 20$ and 30$ versions im finding? is this just the install disc to play offline?
It's steam game. I am playing the game and enjoy it also. price is depend on platform and seller.
Will the UK version work with a US Steam account?
It should do. I've had my steam account since I lived in the UK and I've since installed over 100 U.S games without issue, so you shouldn't have any problems.
I am playing this, is there any way to save the game state? I haven't figured it out or, for that matter how to exit gracefully.
What? Just hit escape and save the game? Then hit exit? I haven't played in a while, so I can't quite remember, but this seems most logical to me.
If this is just a game code for steam, does that mean it can be played cross-platform on PC and Mac?
Nope. It's a game with 2 CDs to run on PC under steam and not a game code. I hope it helps and good luck with this awesome game!!!

No
Does this require the wand motion thingy?
Not required, but it would make it better. We use the regular remote control and it works fine.
does this game have multiplayer mode?
No, it does not. It is single player only. But my kid and I go back and forth until one of us gets 3 stars.
can 2 players play at once?
No
Does this require the wand motion thingy?
Not required, but it would make it better. We use the regular remote control and it works fine.

No, it does not. It is single player only. But my kid and I go back and forth until one of us gets 3 stars.
How well does it work WITHOUT a Kinect SENSOR?
We don't have a Kinect sensor, and it works fine.
Is this a multiplayer?
No this not a multiplayer game
Is it for single player or multiplayers?
I believe it's just single player
is it multiplayer?
No it is not.
Is it a region free media? I have bought my Xbox 360 in Europe and, in order not to have compatibilty problems, I buy only region free games.
I'm not sure where to find if it is or is not. I looked over case, instructions and disc. If you can help me with that, I would be glad to help you.

If I apply this to my 3ds xl will the solution damage the autographs I have on my 3ds?
It is possible. The solution is like mild soapy water and if the autographs are not in some sort of permanent pen like a sharpie.
Does the circle pad pro work with this skin? I wouldn't see why not, but would like to know.
Yes it works
After applying the skin, if I decide that I would like to change it out, will removing the skin in any way damage my 3DS?
I've used Skinomi on other things before and it never damaged anything. I'm ready to remove it from my 3DS. I was happy with the top and bottom
Can this be put on top of vinyl decal stickers?
I think so
Not really a question but... NOTE: This skin will NOT fit the NEW Nintendo 3DS XL. Skinomi, please create a skin that fits the New 3DS XL.... ?
There is a version on Amazon made for n3DSXL by skinomi.
is this item region free
Ntsc version only and not listed as region free compatible.
is is multiplayer?
No multiplayer whatsoever. This means no online, no local, no splitscreen..
Does this game have multiplayer mode?
No, it was cut during development. The game is single-player only although it does have multiplayer type modes besides the campaign but you play against the computer.
is is two player?
No
warranty
they are good but .seem to go wrong easly got them replaced after breaking free of charge but now gone wrong again.
how to setup with pc? Is it simple or am I gonna need a bunch of cables?
It comes with everything you need. Just follow the instructions booklet inside. It's real simple.
Does this work with the Xbox One? I bought the Chat adapter and I get game audio but no chat. I also updated the controller.
No just Xbox 360
Is this headset PC compatible? Why doesn't it specify?
It works perfectly with PC, I have no idea why they don't specify
Is this headset durable?
In my opinion. No. I've had to get the actual headset replaced four times, and bought multiple parts. This is a huge hassle and customer service was very bad.
Does this headset produce a buzz when no sound is going through the headset? Is it a buzz or a white noise?
Yes is has a low buzz when sound is absent. Not noticeable during game play though. Personally doesn't bother me.
All the most recent headsets I have had have a buzz noise when no noise is being played.. Does this have a buzz? I am tired of the BUZZ!
Yes it does. You have to install the piece that you talk into. When I did that, everyone in the game complained I was drowning out everything with a buzzing to THEM, I only heard a slight buzz. Don't buy it. Go for Turtlebeach, learn from my hardship.
Does this require a wire to the ps4 controller for chat to work?
Yes it is not a wireless headset.
is it compatible with xbox one?
Yes , but you need to purchase controller adapter for chat.
Stream quality? Is the mic sound quality good enough to stream with? Im considering these or blue yeti/snowball but id prefer no stand on my desk
The mic is decent however unreliable, the headset is not great quality. I've had two randomly stop working. On materials being poor quality. Invest in Astro's.

retro-link
Yes that is the brand. What's the question?
Can it work with Rasberry Pi?
Yes
Does this work with other games? Not just the retro emulator games?
I've used it a bit to try it out. My copy of Halo: CE (the first one) responds to it (although there's less buttons than on the XBox Controller) so I suppose it's possible it would work for other games.
will it take a rumble pack?
No. The slot is there, but only for aesthetic purposes.
Does it feel authentic, like a real Nintendo 64. Be honest, I want to know before I buy?
Very authentic. Though I will say the first time you play it it can feel a bit stiff. But pay with it a little bit and it will start to loosen up
I just need a controller to work with the Nintendo 64. Will this also work on the Nintendo?
If you're asking if it works with the retro system itself, it does not. Works for computer emulators. However, if you're asking if it works on a Nintendo emulator, it does. I use this controller for gameboy, NES, super nintendo and N64. You just map out the buttons in the controller input setting and map the buttons to whatever feels comfortable for you
is the analogue stick mechanical like an actual N64 controller control stick?
it is a bit different. It's more like the Gamecube stick
If it only works for PC I can deal with it, but does it work thru the USB on the wii-u ? Even in Virtual Console would sound great .
It's not really worth it for the authentic feel. I would recommend a N64 usbadapter instead and no, it's not compatible with Wii-U or any console for that! Hope I could help out! :)
Does it work with extensions like the rumble pak?
Well the plastic mold that you hold has the hole neccesary to allow that. But if you try to look through it you see there is no port, no way for actual electronic pieces to connect. I hope im making myself clear. Also when i connected mine, windows read it like "generic vibrator joystick" or something like that. But i havent seen mine do that. Not that it maters to me. Hope I was helpful.
Does it have key remapping abilities and options? Or do they control 1-10?
Mine didn't come with software, per se, but I could usually re-map in game or in Windows. Had to download a free app to remap on my mac.
?How do I get my head set to be able to heat the tv threw the headset?
I've tried heating it with he headset but it just doesn't work. I'm currently ordering parts to to construct a very large microwave.
Can these be plugged into the actual controller or do they HAVE to be connected via the console?
On a 360 you plug them into the controller for chat, and the console for game audio and power.
can these be used on my pc to watch videos
Yes you may need an adapter to convert your your headphone/line out jack to the RCA connections for the headphones.
Can you use two of these headsets on one Xbox 360 console?
So that's 2 yes and 1 no. What is it???
does anyone know if these can be plugged into a gaming chair and used thru the chairs plugs?
Vikki, I am not sure how many gaming chairs will have a USB port to support amplified headsets. Unless you can tell me which gaming chair it is, I would get a headset like the PX22, Shadow, or Z60 that has a detachable inline amp. These would work as a passive headset using a 3.5mm jack or an amplified headset with USB -- you would have options. Another option that does not use an inline amp at all is the X12 -- 3.5mm plug for game audio and a 3.5mm plug for chat audio. If you have a link to the actual chair I can investigate it for you.
Is this compatible with the Xbox One?
Only if you purchase a headset audio adapter and route the game audio through your TV. You are better off with something like the XO ONE headset which includes the chat adapter and is compatible out of the box. Much cleaner set-up, newer headset, and you don;t have to purchase anything else.
Do these work with the Xbox 360 4g?
My son has Xbox 360 3G. So I am not sure if it works with the 4th generation. I imagine it would though.
if my tv doesn't have output jacks, will these work or...
Probably not. These get audio from the RCA audio jacks and game audio from the 1/8 inch jack that connect to the xbox controller. If your using a tv with just a cable connection you could hook up a VCR and utilize that component to view channels and get the audio out. Or possibly connect directly to the output from the cable box as most of them have multiple outputs on them. Hope this helps.
Can you also use this for Bluetooth or iPhone?
Amanda this is strictly a wired headset, and while you can use it with a PC, it won't work with a mobile device. Let me know if you are looking for a wired or wireless device. And let me know if you want it to work with both an Xbox 360 AND a mobile device, or just a mobile device. I can give you both wired and Bluetooth options for both scenarios.
does it come with every thing
If by everything you mean everything you need to hook it up to your tv and xbox to make it work then yes, yes it does

does it come with every thing
If by everything you mean everything you need to hook it up to your tv and xbox to make it work then yes, yes it does
does this head set also work with a PC
Yes, it works with PC. The chat volume wheel controls the sound from the computer. All you have to do is plug in the headset, the drivers automatically install. Just make sure that the headset is set to be your default device in the sound settings.
ok so im really confused, can i just plug the USB and start playing, will it work if i dont plug in the other wires??
Yes I just checked my daughters hookup and all she has plugged in is the USB. She says the other wires are for systems that don't have USB ports.
Does this headset just hook up to your USB slot or does this have to hook up to the audio/video jacks also (red,white,yelliow) in back of your tv?
It can hook up to both. the USB is for the mic and hearing other people's mics, and the audio/video is so you can hear the game through the headset.
Will these work with the ps4
Yes it will, it will work with all consoles and computers cause it uses a USB port for power.
How long is the Cord on this Headset, I sit about 10 feet away from My TV ..is it long enough to reach 10ft??
Not sure length but more than 10. I sit back and still have cord and it's plugged in back of tv and front of the PS3
i just order this mic heard it was great where does it plug n to playstation 3
usb port in front or on back of ps3
How is the bass if you want to listen to music on your pc? I want it for gaming but since it can also connect to PC i was just curious.
Yes, thes bass feels great. You can also adjust the bass settings on your PC to your liking.you can't adjust the base from the headphones, so you will to do it through your PC. I hope this helps
Are these comfortable with glasses?
Yes they are. My sister uses glasses and uses the headphones. She tells me that they are comfortable.
My PS3 is connected to my stereo by HDMI so how do I hook the headset up? What do I do with the red/white connections, once the usb is plugged in?
if you still have the original ps3 tv plug in wich is red white and yellow your supposed to connect those together. These cables are only to control the volume of the headset. So you should be good without them.
do you have to be online to hear the game 0r cani hear it off line by my self playing my game
You can hear the game when playing on-line and when playing alone off-line

can I play this game on o/s windows 8?
I couldn't play it on any of three systems I tried...save your money - this game is a bust.
Has the Cleopatra slot machine game by Encore been fixed?
I never had a problem
I noticed the bad reviews on this game. I'd like to purchase it, but want to know if the problems still exist with it? Thanks.
I was so frustrated with this game. I have several slot games and never had one that wouldn't load properly. I bought my game in October, but when I looked at more recent reviews, people still seem to have problems with launch. I would like to have this slot game too...if it would work! I would not recommend buying this game. It's not that it wasn't like the ones in the casino, or worked too slowly or didn't pay off too much or too little, it didn't work at all! Buyer beware! Look at the number of reviews that have the exact same complaints about the game and then decide it you think you might get one that actually works. I do have a laptop and some people have said that is why it didn't install, but I have 3 WMS and Reel Deal slots that work perfectly fine on my laptop. Good luck!
Cleopatra II Support item is at http://support.encore.com/technicalsu...
this is a piece of crap , don't buy

when 3 golden eggs appear to pick on why does in stay on screen and what are the crystal collections for?
are u talking about chicken coop or are u talking about something else?
Games keep hanging up (freezing] only way to get the game to play again is to exit . Help !
Simply contact www.PhantomEFX.com and they will send you a link to a patch that will fix this problem.
how and where do i find out how many crystals i have and how do i use to save the forest. there are no instructions or guide to the game
It has been a while since I played this game so I really don't remember. I believe I just clicked in and out of the portals until I discovered how many crystals I had. Either way, the game keeps up with the amount of crystals and once you open all the games, I think that is when you save the forest.
Will this play on Windows 8?
It says on the package a minimum of Windows XP, Vista and 7 (32 or 64 bit). I have Windows 7. Sorry I cannot help you more.
After installation, would I need the disc to play?
I didn't need the disc. However, on some of these games, it requires a disc.
What games are included on this program?
It has been a while since I played it but there are a variety (straight, stacked wilds, and card). The special feature is a game where you play to build a meter and once the meter is full more games appear. Hope that helps.
Can you list all the games in this software, please. Thank you so much in advance.
Off hand, No. I can't list the games, however, there are quite a few games and it is extremely enjoyable. You have to play to unlock future games. When you gain enough points or charms, it allows you to open a new game. You will like it.
Can you please tell me all the games in this slot. Thank you.
I cannot answer, as I never could get game to load. Sorry.
People say this sounds "tinny" without an amp. What makes it sound tinny? Why don't other headphones sound tinny without an amp?
it sounds tiny because it is 150 ohms so it needs an amp to push it but the pc 360 are 50 ohm and dont need an amp ... jus look for a headset with 50 or less ohms and u wont need an amp
My computer doesn't have a microphone jack, so I'll need an adapter. Any recommendations? Should I be looking at 3.5 mm (female) to USB adapters?
This is what I bought with the Sennheiser PC 350 headset, they work perfectly together. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036VO4XO/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
my microphone will not unmute! Any help will be appreciated.
Obvious question: Is it in the upright position (microphone piece)? you must extend it outward to unmute it. Windows 7: Not so obvious: Goto system tray: Right click "Sound" (Speaker Icon) Click 'Sounds' in the context menu that pops up. In the Sound Dialog Box, look for 'Recording'. Speak into your microphone, and observe whether or not green bars are displayed to the right of the active/default device (notated by a green check mark). If a device that is not notated by a green check mark lights up, right click that device and make it the default microphone. Problem Solved. If the device that is notated by a green check mark lights up, right click that device and select Properties. Proceed to 'Levels' tab at the top of the new Microphone properties dialog box. Locate 'Microphone' and adjust the slider beneath it to the maximum volume level. Add some 'Microphone Boost' as well. Go half way on the slider for experimental reasons. Click OK Right click the microphone again, except this time click 'Configure speech recognition' instead of properties. Run through wizard and test your microphone.
How long are the audio/mic jack wires?
They cord is quite long. I measured and it is approximately 9.5 feet long.
Any difference between PC 350 and PC 350 Special Edition? Which one to buy?
Both headsets are somewhat similar. The Special Edition has its volume control built-in on the right ear cup, which in my opinion, is much better. Also, the PC 350 SE comes with a carrying case, while if I'm not mistaken, the old 350 does not. Overall, the PC 350 SE is a totally improved PC 350, so the obvious choice would be to buy the SE, rather than buying the older model.
does this have a usb connection
No it doesn't... You can get a usb adapter though.
Is the adjustment band made out of metal?
no plastic but it is sturdy
Is it comfortable even if I wear glasses?
I wear them for hours at a time while wearing my glasses and they are very comfortable.
This or the PC 360? I want a noise blocking headphone, also a good microphone and these two seem vaguely familiar.
go with the pc350se IF you don't want to hear anything but whats coming through the headphones. I think overall I like the PC350se's better because of construction. I actually prefer to hear things in the room and the pc360's are nice for that, plus I think I prefer their sound slightly better but I had to sell one so I sold the PC360's. I use the "Listen to this device" soundblaster option so I can at least hear myself talk through the microphone on the pc350se's
wich is better this or the pc 360
The PC350 is CLOSED back meaning they offer pretty good noise cancellation but the sound is isolated within the earcup. The PC360 is OPEN back meaning they leak sound but have a MUCH better soundstage (the perception you gain of where the sound is coming from) than a closed back headset. I have both (PC 350 and PC 360) and the PC 360 wins, hands down. I cannot describe to you the difference between open back and closed back. You just have to experience it for yourself. At first, I thought I wanted a closed back headset (PC 350). Now, having experienced the soundstage presented by an open back headset (PC 360), I am convinced that an open back design is the best.

is it possible to hold a 3DS XL that's being enclosed in the duraflexi protector?
If you mean a plastic case then yes. I have one on mine and it still has room.
Will this case fit a New 3DS XL?
Yes, perfectly
Does this case have enough room for the 3ds XL and a circle pad pro?
If it adds lots of width then no. The 3DS XL is comfortably filling the case
Can it fit 6 games along with a thicker stylus? I have an older version of this case that only holds 3 games that fits towards the front
It can hold up to 6 games (7 if you include a game in your 3ds like I do). As for the thicker stylus, it really depends on the measurements of the stylus because the slot that I see can hold a thickee stylus as long as it is no longer than 3-4 inches or so.
Pic clearly holds 6 games. But the description is 3 games only. Someone clear that up. Thanks
Holds 6, description is inaccurate.
Is it possible to hold a standard 3ds, 6-7 games, and a charger?
Holds easily 12 games but charger will not fit at all.
so, i dont have anything on my 3ds xl.its just plain.will it fit in this? and will 3ds games fit perfectly in this?
It's a soft interior hard shell case for the XL. Storage space for 3 games perfectly, might fit with a small case on the 3DSXL. I've had mine over a year now and it's held up perfectly.
Can I fit my 3ds XL + Hori TPU hard case in the slot?
You shouldn't have an issue. Might be a little snug.
So this fits a Hori Tpu Case + a 3ds, and still fits?
Yes! I use it all of the time when I take it to school and it's great. I feel safe that it wont move around while in case or get face damage because the outer layer provides enough protection. Hope this helps!
Is the middle strap elevated from the "pit" where the 3DS is placed?
Yes it is
does it have offline multiplayer?
It does have offline Multi-player (split-screen) up to 4 players. We've done 2 player split-screen mostly.
Does this game work on the PS3 with PS4 controllers?
I know the game works on PS3 but I don't know about the controllers I am sure they would work....the game is for the PS3 only but if ps4 controller can be program to the PS3 I don't see why it wouldn't work
is this version of the game the bonus edition or the regular version? looking for metal sonic and outrun bay code
It's regular version
Can I invite my online friends (who also have the same game) so we can race against each other or is it just random people I can race against online?
Of course I get invites from online friends all the time and conversely invite my friends for races. I've had great fun.
Is this game region locked?
What region? Most are locked when you start the game.
Are the dlc voucher codes that are supposed to come with new copies of the "Bonus Edition" still good and able to be redeemed?
I didn't see an expiration date on any included material. If the game is new, you shouldn't have any issues.
do you have to have a racing wheel to play? is there a specific wheel that i should buy?
No. You can play the game with a controller. You do not need a racing wheel. As far as which racing wheel you should buy, I don't really know because I don't have one. But I would assume that any racing wheel would work as long as the game supports use of that peripheral. It's a fun game so either way, I think you'll enjoy it. Have fun!
I dont want to use the analog sticks, how can i switch to d-pad?
when going through the option in the game the control only has 2 options and the both option are using the analog stick to steer, the d-pad is to look back ... so it looks like you can't switch it to d-pad.
does this support the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel?
Not this game but GTA.

It does have offline Multi-player (split-screen) up to 4 players. We've done 2 player split-screen mostly.
Does this game work on the PS3 with PS4 controllers?

Hi there, we are looking to purchase a copy of Battlefield 4. Does this come in a premium edition similar to Battlefield 3? thanks Connor.
As of right now, there is no prebundled BF4 that has premium access. The premium still needs to be purchesd separately from the game. Im sure as more time passes, EA will release a premium edition game
If I buy the disk can I download the game from there or do i have to use the disk every time I want to play the game?
Download the game from disc and go. Disc doesn't have to be in computer to use.
does this work on windows 8
Yes. My daughter plays it on windows 8. :)
can you have babys in this game?
Yes! There is even a chance to have baby triplets.
Can you change de language settings to dutch?
I looked online for an answer to this question and it seems you can change the language to Dutch if you are willing to edit your system registry files. There is a You Tube video showing how to do this (http://youtu.be/4BxpBYoA7Sk) and webpage with the same information (http://sims3.crinrict.com/en/2013/04/change-the-language.html). Please be advised that changing registry information can make Windows, your game, and/or your computer to stop working properly; You must feel comfortable and knowledgeable before taking this action of editing. If the links I have included are not posted by Amazon just Google/search "how to change language on sims 3" or " sims 3 in other languages" Please note that the region of the disc will limit the installation choices for language from the game start up screen. Region 1 appears to only offer the game in English, Spanish, and French. Region 2 appears to have a few more options for languages. Because of these region limitations, registry editing is the only way to change the language if it is not offered on the start up screen. Also know that if you edit your registry for the game to Dutch (nl-NL) you will need to do the same for all expansion pack registries. Finally, remember the Sims speak their own language so if you are attempting to make the Sims characters speak Dutch it is impossible. The Sims characters all speak Simlish - Sims language that cannot be changed. Good luck to you with this and be very careful if changing your registry. Note: I have never personally changed my game's language. This information is based on what I found by research online (I was curious myself if it could be done successfully.)
does this come with the 16-digit code to make the game work and the original instruction booklet? last copy i bought did not have the code
yes
Do I need to download the sims 3 and this one or does sims seasons come with sims 3 too
You'll need to buy the original Sims 3 separately.
You Need To Have The Base Game, Correct?
Correct. You must have the Sims 3 base game to play any of the expansions
After downloading the expansion pack and installing it, it does not show up on the launcher. How can i fix this?
yes it did on mine ,If your having trouble getting it on yours try installing using administrator some times the computer is older then the game or the game is older then the computer. Hope this helps good luck .
How do you get the code it asks for in the installer?
It's on the back of the pamphlet that comes inside the case
FLIGHT SIMULATOr for mac
I don't know
can you fish in the game
Yes
Can you have more than one company on this version?
yes you can
Is QB Pro 2013 with enhanced payroll offered for multi user license for 2 users
It is my understanding that they offer only a single or three-user license. They are very helpful, go on-line and get their contact telephone number for sales they can give you the details
Once i purchase the Quickbooks Pro 2013 with Enhanced Payroll, will i still need to purchase a year subscription ??
Only if you want to upgrade to unlimited employees. The Enhanced will only allow you to pay up to three employees. If you process more than three you will be charged by Quickbooks per employee.
Can I install it on my business computer and my home computer so that I can work at home if necessary?
Yes. Here is the official Intuit position on this: "With a single-user license, you can install QuickBooks on 1 computer and on 1 additional portable computer (e.g., a laptop that you own and use in your business) as long as both devices are used by the same person. ONLY that specified person can access and use QuickBooks on both computers." My note: the second computer does NOT need to be a laptop or portable, but the rest of the conditions apply. Let me know if you need more info.
What is the annual fee for the payroll for three or more?
Extra $100 for 4+ employees. I just called. It's a bit of a hassle if you already have a payroll subscription, like I do. First you have to cxl your current subscription, then install the payroll disc and then call and they charge you the full whack ($429) for enhanced payroll, then credit back the value they assign to the enhanced payroll of 3 or fewer employees ($329). SO, if you get the enhanced payroll for less than $329 off the shelf (i.e. Costco or Amazon), then you decide if it's worth the hassle. From everything I've read, the 2013 QB Pro is not something to be super excited about, and may even boggle your brain due to poorer visual interface, new report menu format, etc. I'm thinking about getting the Value pack and if I can do the payroll only, and without simultaneously upgrading the QB Pro, then that's what I'll do for now.
2 part problem: The payroll checks I just processed didn't have any taxes taken out. Went into QB to fix and my company doesn't exist. How to fix?
I hope you do back up. I would think your company has disappeared so you'll have to do a restore:( Good Luck. Ask again if you need more info. Michael
I will run payroll on office computer and do all other accounting, invoicing, reports, etc on my home lap top. how to sync the payroll info to home?
I believe you will have to backup QB to zip drive at the office and bring the zip drive home to update QB there.
When purchasing the Enhanced Payroll (1 employee)does it give me the 1st yr subscription with it, or is it additional $ for subscribing?
Yes it includes a 1 yr subscription. I find this amazing because Quckbooks was going to charge me in Oct. $349.00 for my one year but I saved that by buying the QB's Pro 2013 upgrade and the one year P/R. I guss I will buy a payroll package from Amazon each year now.
If we purchase 3 user licenses does that mean three people can use the system and on 6 different compurters 3 desktop and 3 portable
I don't think you will able to do that, you might call quickbooks.
how do you know if software processes 0-3 employees versus unlimited ?
The answer is on your payroll key. It says unlimited or 0-3 employees
If we purchase Quickbooks from Amazon, does Intuit still provide support? They tell me that you may not get their actual product. Is this true?
Yes, Intuit will still provide support even though you don't purchase the product directly from them. We have had no problem with calling them up and asking for assistance. You get the actual QuickBooks Pro 2013 - 3 User product.
can I get on from a remote location as long as only 2 others are on?
The short answer is yes you can. You have to have a server set up (which you must have done) and be able to get through your firewall. Perhaps you have security set up already and will need to use tunneling software from a remote location.
Is this an actual disc or download only? I really want/need the disc
This is a disc.
can be installed on mac computer
The Mac platform requires the Mac version of QBooks. It has the capability of converting the data back and forth between the Mac and PC versions if required. There are also a few functionality and feature differences between the Mac and PC versions, but they are pretty close.
If we purchase the actual disc, are we able to download also?
I think that is one for Quicken staff. I would think it is one or the other. Disk or download. Not sure, but disk is sometimes a little higher price than download. I choose disk because I move around to different machines and I think it would be less hassle than placing or removing the licenses on those machines.
We recently bought Quickbooks Pro 2013 3-user. Can we buy single user version and have all 4 people working in the same company file at the same time?
No, it is not possible for the 4 users to work at the same time. You definitely would need a multi user version.
when playing swap force and the narrator says you need a giant to get into this.. are these the giants they are meaning?
Yes! There are 8 kinds of element giant skylander, you can use any one to explore a place or to break something where you find a giant icon. And you may some bonus or some stuff. Anyway you don't need to use giants still can finish the game (not completed), otherwise waste $$ on giants.
will this work with PS2?
No. If you go to the Skylanders Activision game page for Giants, towards the bottom it lists the systems it is available for. PS2 is not there. Here is the link to that page. http://www.skylanders.com/video-games/skylanders-giants Look towards the bottom, there is a bit picture of the character Hot Head and it lists the systems there and also at the bottom of each particular game page. This means they only made and sold starter packs, which you have to have so you can have the portal for the figure to sit on and the game disc, for those systems.

Do you have to pay a monthly subscription to play this game, and if so, how much?
You can pay 13 bucks a month for a limit of 1 character PER server(not data center. The data center is basically the mega server that hosts all the little servers/worlds). Save yourself a couple of bucks...as you don't really need multiple characters anyways...as you you can play ALL jobs with one character AND you can change your race once in the game.
Hi, Does this product includes the CD-Key needed to register and play?
Yes it does you get one free month to play then every month after is $15.00
Is it a Steam version or can I directly punch in activation code in FF14 client? I would prefer a direct activation code that can be used in 14 client
I bought and used it through the ff website since I had an account from the free trial. So the answer is steam free.
Can I use a Xbox 360 game controller for the PC version?
Yes, as long as your pc is bluetooth compatible.
Can I use this particular item in Australia? I have noticed that some discs can only be used in Europe or the US..
As far as I know there is no problem with the disk you should be able to use it.
Which is better the steam version or the FF14 client? (I mean the steam version uses the FF14 client anyways right?)
No choice between the two;;
My wife wants to try the game on her own PC using my account, if she does like it do we have to buy a second disc for her to play on her own account?
Yes you will have to buy a second copy for a second account. You will need another serial number is the reason. There is a 14 day free trial that just came out she can use to try the game for free as well.
may purchase soon, is it online only or can i play single player story mode. don't care for mmorpg games.
This game is online play only. It is very similar to WoW's game play but with the Final Fantasy feel to it. It is much different from Final Fantasy XI. All in all this game is fun if you have a few friends to play with. I didn't care for the game much until I played it for a few weeks.
So I heard spam bots and farming bots rip this game to shreds, not a very wise purchase wouldn't you agree?
Absolutely not! I havent had a more friendly environment than this game. Sure there are gold spammers here and there, but thats pretty much EVERY game. But as far as bots go? Who? Where?
can i play offline just a story line type single player, or is it online only?
Sorry, it is online only, no counsel only single player story.
can this work with the WII?
Yes. I bought it for my son and he uses it on the Wii.
Does this work with XBox?
Yes. The figures are universal. They work with any system.
Does this figure come as shown, or with original packaging, code and card? I ask because the Amazon link ("http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-list... that lead me to this page said it was sealed, but the picture clearly shows it out of its' case.
The package was not sealed but everything was included, code, etc.
Do the graphics differ depending on different consoles?
Yes but not by design. Different consoles and tv's provide varying resolutions of the game graphics. The character will be the same on any console. However how clear the detail is and the colors will differ. Even on two consoles of the same kind. (Because tv is different)
can this figure be played with other skylander games or just the skylander giants game only?
It's a universal figure
Does this work with Nintendo 3DS
I only have a PS3 so I cannot say how it will work on a DS

Will this Hard Drive fit my "Xbox 360 E" not slim, but "E"? DO I need anything else or just the drive?
Yes, it will fit. That's what I have and it works great. Shouldn't need anything else with it.
Can this hard drive recognize original xbox games, most aftermarket HDD's don't
No, and strongly advise you not waste your money
do you need to have the transfer cable for this hard drive?
No you don't, you insert a flash drive to your Xbox move what items you want to the flash drive. After you done that install the new hard drive and then you can move what you have on the flash drive to the hard drive.
Is this an official microsoft product? Will it play original xbox games?
If its the one from haussbell, no. You have to buy the $60 from the Microsoft seller for it to work with original Xbox games. Anything but the specific Microsoft brand will not play original Xbox games.
Battlefield 4 requires a 2gb hard drive space to install the game, but it needs a Microsoft offical hard drive. Will this HDD emulate microsoft HDD?
Yes,it will. I installed bf3 with no problems. But doesn't BF4 require a whole lot more than that?
My xbox 360 S hard drive has a model number --1451. Is that what this product is also? Model 1451?
Its not OEM so model numbers won't help but I assure you it will work with your 360 s as it did with my 360 s to test for my nephews 360 e
Does it work with Destiny?
I'm not sure, he don't have that game, but we have been having issues with our XBOX live. He can't play online and hasn't been able to in a week. The hard drive does work. I had to figure it out. But it works.
Can i download my Xbox deals and Games with Gold Deals from the marketplace in this hardrive?
I am sure you can, just use the Xbox like a computer when it ask you where to save it you will have the option to either use either storage area's. Hope this was helpful.
I have the red ring of death now ever since inserting the hard drive. It fits perfectly and I hear the click it makes when I insert it.
I have no experience with that issue. The only thing I know is that this hard drive is specifically for the 360 SLIM, so if you are using it on a standard 360 that could be the problem; although I'm not a tech or a gamer. I bought it for my grandsons 360 Kinect Slim. Sorry I couldn't be more help to you.
Will I be able to download xbox live games for gold to this hard drive? I don't seem to be able to specify where games with gold downloads go.
Yes
Will the sims 3 games work on a windows 8 or 8.1 computer? Or will it just work on the windows xp computers?
I have a windows 8 it works jus fine you can check this site to see if The Sims 3 runs on your computer. http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/ when you reach the site just type The Sims 3 and it will tell you if it can work. Because it really depends on the graphics and other hardware. Good luck
Why do i have to buy the first orginal sims 3 to be able to play sims 3 pets? also is sims 3 seasons a substitute for the sims 3(the first game)?
All of The Sims 3 games, ie seasons, are expansion games of the original game. They add new features to the original game play. If you want to wait, Sims 4 is planned for release at the end of the year.
it says requires hardcopy
It requires the Sims 3 base game. This is an expansion to the base game.
Will I be able to add these expansions through Origin if I didn't download my base Sims 3 through Origin? (I downloaded it directly through Amazon.)
I don't think it matters as long as you have the base game.
I have the base game &amp; dlc on disk with Origin. Will amazon dlc work with it? Steam ones do not, so I worry
Yes I bough some from orgin and amazon and they work fine !
Is the online game code basically a download?
Yes, you download the extra game content and they send an email with the game code you need. It's pretty easy.
I just downloaded the game and it keeps crashing. Is there a way to prevent it from crashing?
I would uninstall and reinstall and check for an update

Can you set the macro keys (on the left of the keyboard) to media keys? (I.e: Mute, Volume up, Volume down?
Yes. They even have presets on Synapse 2.0 for this.
Since it has has individual back light can you customize them individually by color or intensity or does the whole keyboard need to be one color?
It is always green but you can change the brightness.
is this the stealth edition? by stealth i mean does this have the matte finish? or the glossy one? because i believe the stealth edition has the matte finish, so that fingerprints dont go all over.
This one for sale is NOT the stealth addition, however this being the 2013 still has the matte finish. The one from 2012 is glossy with blue lights, the 2013 is matte with green lights. Source: viewed in person at store
can you use this with windows 8
Yes, you can use this with windows 8.
Is this the cherry MX blue keyboard?
Yes, the Ultimate uses Cherry MX Blue key switches. The Stealth - which is quieter - uses Cherry MX Brown.
I have a razer black widow (mx blue) and some keys feel different. They make a weaker click sound and tactile feel when pressed. Is this normal?
Yes. The space bar, backspace, enter, any key that isn't the size of a letter key will sound different because they use a leveling bar. Still a MX blue underneath, but the leveling bar make a different sound
What's the difference between the ultimate and the ultimate elite?
Looks like the ultimate doesn't have lit keys
can you completely turn off back light?
this is my son's purchase but I asked and yes, you can dim it to all-the-way-turn-off the back light
These use mx blues right?
I bought it a while ago and from this one I got the mx blues. I do not know if it has changed but the ones I am using from when I got this from a few months ago is mx blues. "Razer Black widow Ultimate 2013 Elite Mechanical Gaming Keyboard" is what is says under product description. I am going to say they are MX blues but not 100% sure. 2013 are mx blues anyways. Hope this has helped you.
Does it work well?
Yes it does ive had a problem with it but amazon fixed it right away everything is perfectly fine now.
what is the age group of this?
We actually purchased 2 for Christmas gifts for our grandsons. One was almost eight years old. The other was three and a half. Both do fine with it. We make sure we purchase age appropriate games.
Where is it manufactured? Does it come with a charger and stylus?
Taiwan and use it comes with both in an unopened box.
does this have a camera?
Yes it does works great
Will 3ds games work with this?
Nop...
how many games brings ?
If you are asking about the number of games there is a lot if you want to use the old DSI games they can be played on the 3d DSI but 3d games can not be played on the DSI. Our family has both. We have 3 my grandson and I have the old DSI but my husband has the 3rd. I like the DSI not so much the 3d only because the screen is small. I have bought used games on Amazon and Have not had a problem
&iquest; COMES WITH GAMES INCORPORATED ?
In the words of Chief Keef, "Nah"
Does DSi 3.25 play DS games?
Yes, i play ds games in R4 card
what type of batteries does nintendo ds take?
It doesn't take batteries, it has a charger which plugs in to an outlet.
does it come with a charger
Of course it does! Nintendo is the Nutella of handheld gaming!
Is this a good headset maybe for game recording or capturing, I am really depending on the microphone the most.
Excellent sound quality for the money, two year warranty. Buy with confidence.
is this headset compatible with the ps4?
Yes
How long are the cables? I plan to game on the couch with these bad boys, but I need to make sure I don't have to be close to my tv.
I just stretched it across my room to measure it for you and i ran out of room lol. It's over 15 ft. Very long.
Would this headset be compatible with an Astro Mix Amp? Would it be suggested to buy an Amp with this headset?
I believe it should work with the astro amp with its USB Input but I used it without an amp and it worked excellently with good hefty sound right out of the box on its own.
Is this compatible with Wii U?
The short answers is NO. Sennheiser makes no mention of Wii U compatibility in manuals or on there website, however, in a pastemagazine online review, they state, """"And they work well for the Wii U, too, even though there's no mention of Nintendo's weird little system on the U320's packaging."""" We do not have a Wii U to try and verify this so take this information at your own risk.
Is it possible to use with phones
No. It doesn't have the audio jack cable thing
XBOX ONE setup: Does this headset just need to plug into the xbox stereo headset adapter, or does it still need to use the usb chat mixer thing also?
I think it may use both, Im still thinking if ill order one but I remember reading about this on the Sennheiser website. Id say give it a look. These are Xone compatible so thats why Im taking interest.
Are these compatible with PS2? The Amazon page says they are but the manufacturer's spec sheet doesn't mention PS2.
Yes
Im guessing pc definitely has the 7.1 surround sound, but is the audio the same on consoles? Or is it only default stereo sound for my PS4?
Not sure. I can, however, tell you that the chat volume switching did not work for me on my PS4. The volume of the headset was also kind of low. I ended up returning mine and got an Afterglow headset that GameStop currently has on clearance. Check for these in your area. They are clearance priced down to $149.99. http://www.imgur.com/IH1P0m1.jpeg
Is it Xbox One compatible?
You would also need a Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/headsets/stereo-headset-adapter

I don't think so.
Will it play on Windows 8? Is it touch screen enabled?
I am not sure, I play the game on my Win 7.
I downloaded this game for my mac and it is not compatible. However on Steam it says its mac compatible? Any help?
It seems like you got the PC download version. There is a PC and a Mac download. Sadly, I don't think there are refunds on digital media.

I dont know if the download through amazon includes it but when i downloaded it through steam it wasnt included
will play on windows 8.1
Yes it will

Is this game compactable with windows vista or windows 7?
I successfully played/completed the game on Windows 7, no problems.
Does this game run on Windows 8.1? Thank you for an answer
Yes
A great game, especially the graphics. Does anybody else have blurry pictures in the strategy guide?
No, my strategy guide does not have blurry pictures.
Will this run on Windows 7?
Also, run the installer with administrative privileges. No problems
will silent hunter 4 wolfs of the pacific run on windows 8?
Yes, I have windows 8.1 and it runs fine, good luck.
Is this playable without being online to Internet? Somewhere I get the idea that his is an online only game.
The game can be played offline, but the game does have a multiplayer feature.
will this run on windows 8.1?
It runs fine from what I can tell
what version will i be downloading
Hi, Brian. I suggest downloading the Gold Edition that has the U Boat version included. I forgot what the version is called but I am very pleased with this game and you really can't beat the price. One thing this game requires a lot!!!! of patience to play it in real mode. I hope this helps.
Where's the manual? I purchased/downloaded the game, but no user's guide?
Most digital games don't come with the manual. Use the link below for a PDF version of it. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&ei=CLyEU9-mJpCjqAaX-YFo&url=http://mypdfmanuals.com/user-manual,GAMES%2BPC,SILENT%2BHUNTER%2B4,602056.pdf&cd=1&ved=0CCQQFjAA&usg=AFQjCNFV8O1WEi34883ajt3DDPsn9207vw
What is the difference between SH4 and SH4 gold edition?
The core application is for the U.S. subs in the pacific against the Japanese. SH4 Gold includes all of the U-Boat missions that occurred in the Pacific. So it is like two games in one.
Will this run on windows 8?
Yes I have windows 8 and it runs excellent.
What's the DRM on this? Does this redeem on Steam?
I have not played this product on steam. I downloaded it from amazon directly to my computer. The product comes with a key that you have to use while installing the game.

Can the top part be taken off? I simply want the grips not the whole protection part (though that isn't bad, but i think it's ugly)
If I understand your question correctly, yes it's is two peices one that goes over the top an one over the bottom.
Is everything properly aligned and easy to access like buttons and holes for the charging port and stylus holder ?
Yes, everything is easy to get to. All of the buttons, 3D slider, Sound, stylus, camera, speakers, is open. The picture and shipped product match. I have big man hands, and this fits.
If I put my 3ds xl in this case would it be able to still fit in here?: http://www.amazon.com/HORI-Retro-Mari...
No, it wouldn't. The dreamGEAR IS A CASE WITHIN ITSELF. It gives a great controller feel to it and provides security from accidental drops, NOT any intentional spikes to the floor. Overall. From one gamer to another, this completed my XL gaming experience!
Hello, I have a new Nintendo 3DS (XL) rather than an original 3DS XL. Will this grip work with the newer model?
Sadly no, it more of stretches around the handheld than a snug look and the button perforation isn't set for the new 3ds xl. You can mod it but the whole thing slips off pretty easy being that it doesn't fit correctly.
Does this game help alleviate hand cramps playing Mario Kart 7? I am getting lots of cramps in my index fingers keeping them on the shoulder buttons.
yes, i had the same cramping problem and this totally helped my hands stay more relaxed. your fingers will curl around the bottom cushion and not the small plastic console. it comes as two pieces, screen cover and finger pad cover. any more questions, let me know.
does this fit the new 3ds xl?
NO. This WILL NOT fit the New 3DS XL that released in Feb 2015. The NEW model has extra buttons, has the stylus and cartridge slot in different spots and is slightly bigger. I contacted the manufacturer and they responded saying there will be a new one for the NEW 3DS XL sometime around April 2015. No exact date though.
Will there be one for the New Nintendo 3DS XL?
Yes there will be a new one for the NEW 3DS XL that released in Feb 2015. I contacted the manufacturer and they responded saying sometime around April 2015. No exact date though.
Does it close
Yes, it will close. There are two separate covers for the top and buttom of the 3ds xl. The game will open and close easily.
I'm sure it won't but will this fit with a plastic case already around a 3DS XL? Please only answer if you know. Thank you.
The Dreamgear fits skin-tight so, no, it won't fit over a protective plastic case without stretching too much and possibly tearing.
Does this case also fit the Nintendo DSi XL? (not 3DSi)....for which there is no available case at the moment?
Unfortunately it cannot fit the DSi XL....sorry. Yes I do have the DSi XL and tried it but it didn't work :p
does the headset work on the Wii? or does it work on just the Wii u?
Just the Wii U. It uses a standard 1/8" stereo plug with mic that plugs into the headphone jack on the Wii U GamePad. There is nowhere on the original Wii to plug it in.
Can you actually hear audio? From videos and even the game? or we can only use this to chat?
Yeah u can hear in the game and video or use it with ur phone
With regular headphones and some games and will continue playing sound through the TV unless I have it on gamepad mode. Does this headset fix it?
That option is part of the wii u. do there is nothing to fix.
What size jack does it have? I've tried every headset in the store with a 3.5mm jack and it doesn't fit my tablet or Nintendo 3ds xl.
Well the problem is very simple, this headset is made ONLY for the Wii U and 3DS. It won't work on a tablet. As for your 3DS XL....it works on my NORMAL 3DS...I don't like the XL so I'm not sure if it would work on the XL or not, I think both the Normal and XL 3DS use the same head jack, so basically this would work on your 3DS XL, but it wont work on the tablet. It was specifically made for the Wii U and 3DS ONLY.
How do I test the Mic? What games are headphones good for on the Wii U?
wii u to wii u calling program. black ops 2 ghosts super smash bros (only for multiplayer with friends) also probably works in a computer with mic test,
can the mic be detachable for other use ex. MP3 player?
No. It's permanently attached.
Can I use the mic with Mario Kart and Super smash smash bros (for 3ds)?
Yes you can
Does it work with Nintendo 3D?
Yes
Does the Headset works plugin on PC? Thanks
Yes
what do you do with the microphone other than game chat on 3ds?
Well my son has the Wii u and uses it when he plays Black ops game to talk with the other players in game mode.
does the headset work on the Wii? or does it work on just the Wii u?
Just the Wii U. It uses a standard 1/8" stereo plug with mic that plugs into the headphone jack on the Wii U GamePad. There is nowhere on the original Wii to plug it in.

Can the backlight led's change to red?
Yes they can
What key type is this? I'm guessing rubber dome?
I am guessing yes. Well constructed though, cause you still get the tactile feedback and it has a low profile.
What is the size (Length and Width)? I was wondering if It could fit in the pull-out tray of my desk.
it is 8.5 inches by 20 inches, it fits on a small keyboard tray, not a lot of room left, but enough to tightly fit a mouse
How long is the wire on this keyboard?
I measured mine... it's five feet long.
is it compatible with windows 8.1?
Yes. It may take a few steps but it can work. you might need to take the .exe file once it's downloaded and put that in compatibility mode for it to work. I have windows 8.1 and the only thing giving me issues is the fact i'm running it on a lower-end laptop.
I need to know if this will work on windows 7 64 bit? Someone said yes, some other guy said no!
Works fine, i'm running windows 7 64 bit, already beat both episodes.
I can play multiplayer if i buy it?
Yes.I tested freeroam out and it works.
Any Canadians get this code to work? or is it strictly U.S?
I think strictly U.S.
How do you get this to work with Windows 8.1 since there is no GFWL (since this was require to save progress) service now?
There is a Games for Windows Live update that Microsoft has available on their website. After installing the game Windows 8.1 gave me a dialog box that said there was a known comparability issue and provided the link to the download within the dialog.
Will this work on my windows 7 64 bit computer?
Yes that is what I play it on.
Is this a code you can redeem on Steam?
Yeap and its smooth
Is it compatible with Windows 7
It it's compatible with Windows 7 but there is no guarantee it will run well. The problem isn't your version of Windows but how poorly it was changed to work on any computer.
Does this work with in steam Europe?
I had to do something with windows to get it to work. Can't remember what exactly. As for Europe i m guessing it shouldn't make a difference.
How can I login to save my progress? I don't think the games for windows live works and is not letting me log in.
It also doesn't work for me.

do you get the mad catz or cyborg version? Also, do the keys light up and (if so) are you able to choose the color?
Hi, I don't know what version it is, I think it may be the cyborg version and yes the keys do light up and yes you can choose the colour
I saw in a video that someone had a different logo next to the keyboard instead of the red Mad Catz one. Is it possible to replace the Mad Catz one?
Yes but you will void the warranty.
I noticed in a video that this keyboard has a power outlet i want to know if it is a Bi Voltage keyboard (110v and/or 220v)
Yes Bruce. This was a big concern of mine as well. I am stationed overseas and was worried I would have to use a transformer. It supports 100-240V.
Every time I try to use the profile editor it keeps saying this "Plug in the device you wish to configure and run the program again." what do I do?
Im sorry I no longer own the keyboard. I sold it because it we terrible!
Does this keyboard use mechanical switches or have n-key rollover?
I don't know about rollover, but this is a membrane keyboard: "Replete with a specially engineered membrane which mimics the tactile feel generated by the mechanical keys often preferred by gamers - - without the resultant excessive noise." I'd assume (if this statement is correct) that it mimics cherry mx brown switches, except for a lower activation point.
I know nothing about gaming-Except that my 22yr-old son plays.I was looking for gaming mouse then saw keypads-but is this better? Any recommendations?
It is a great looking keyboard, for sure, and might even have worked...that is, if I could have ever have gotten it to work with Windows 8.1 I was forced to return it because there were problems with the Windows 8.1 drivers...they may be fixed now, but I doubt it based on everything I could discover on the web about the keyboard. It was a few months ago, so you might give it a try but just wanted to let you know the problems I had with it.
Can you set the keyboard backlighting to change based on what program or game you are running?
There are three buttons on the LCD touch screen. These buttons are basically different modes where you can have totally different key bindings and backlight coloring/brightness. I do not think (but I haven't tried, so I'm not totally sure) that you can change the color of the lighting without accessing the touch screen (i.e. automatically). That being said: I've been using a standard $20 keyboard for gaming for 5 years, and I love this gaming keyboard. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
I'm purchasing this keyboard in the US. Will it be the ISO version or the ANSI version? The pictures in the item listing show both.
ANSI
Can't Download the softwares or the driver. says page not available. Seems the Business only works 9-3. no tech support .
All I can say man is good luck, I tried for almost two months to get in touch with mad catz about this very item, never managed, so now my keyboard sits in a box and I tell everyone not to buy their products.
is the key clicky or silent
I am sorry. This was a gift for a friend of a friend overseas
Does this controller work with a Nexus 7?
Yes it does, I use mine with my nexus 7 all the time. Pops right up with bluetooth pairing.
Can you connect 2 of these controllers to an iPad and have 2 player gaming?
Well as far as I have investigated, there's a problem. Im trying to smooth out a connection issue with my galaxy SIII, and two of these controllers. I can get them to connect, assign them a control 1 and control 2, but they act as the same controller. I kinda lost interest in messing with it. Far as a ipad, im not sure what your outcome will be. However I think its possible, though difficult to get them to cooperate.
Does this work for iPad air and is it compatable with all games
This controller only works on the android and windows devices. There are apple controllers available, however I cant vouch for any of them. Search youtube for "ipad Bluetooth game controllers reviews" should point you in the right direction.
It will work fine with Android Box Minix Neo X8H and Ipad Mini 2?
Yes, as far as the mini box has Bluetooth. On both with games that support a gamecontroller
3 Questions actually: A. Does this work with the Fire TV stick? [I do have Prime] and B. Does is work with Dell Venue 8" tablet? C. Does it work with iPHONE6 &amp;/or Samsung S5 phones?
Works with my Galaxy S5 just fine.
Good day, will this controller be compatible with a 60" hisense smart android tv? thank you! :-)
Hi Lez, I don't have access to a Hisense TV, but this controller works very well with a tablet and an android tv box y have, so I suppose that if you tv is an android one with BLUETOOTH capabilities, it will do the work. Good luck.
If I purchase this controller. Will it work for amazon fire tv games?
Could not get it to work with the fire stick
Does this work with the Fire Stick?
With the Fire TV box, it worked with directional arrows but it wouldn't let you select anything. It stopped syncing almost immediately. It looks great but I don't think it was made for this interface. Save your money.
How do you get this device in pairing mode? My android box doesn't see it at all?
Hold one of the action buttons (A/B/X/Y) for whichever function you want, and then press and hold the power button until the lights on the front flash. Then use your android bluetooth settings to scan for available devices and pair it there. A is keyboard mode (emulators) and X is gamepad mode (supposedly for 3D games, but never works). You have to unpair the device every time you finish with it before you re-search.

Its a 6 inch HDMI cord and not a composite cable a.k.a red,white, yellow thing (winks)

I am not sure,..I think so,..but he is deployed..will ask him when avail..
Will it work with the Xbox One, PS3 &amp; PC? Does it have speakers &amp; HDMI? How is it powered?
It does have one HDMI connector. The monitor has it's own speakers and hat are powered by the monitor's power supply. It's supposed to work with the PS and the Xbox one but not having either of those I can't verify that.
Will it work with the Xbox One, PS3 &amp; PC? Does it have speakers &amp; HDMI? How is it powered?
Yes it works you just need the conversion kit off the gaems website to make it able to carry it securely.
Where do i buy this item for xbox1?
The One fits in the case just like the 360.
Can an Xbox One fit into this device?
Yes
Does it come with the Halo 4 edition controller shown in the images?
No
does it have a battery
No
Do i need a 7.1 Surround sound card for these to be fully functional.
Using them in Xbox or Playstation you shouldn't, using PC I can't tell. IMHO, A50 works really good and deliver good sound, but do'nt expect a real 7.1 sound experience.
Does it come with an optical cable
Yes it comes with all the cables you need to connect the base audio.
Its campatible with windows 8?
Yup..both windows 8 and 8.1
How do these feel while wearing glasses? I need glasses to see my tv and the current headset I have now digs into me, these look more comforting
I have to wear glasses all the time too. I have no issues with these headsets with my glasses.
these headphones work with ps3
Yes. 360, PS3, PC, PS4, and Xbox One with Xbone headset adapter.
Does this headset offer surround sound? Also, how long does the battery last on a full charge?
Yes it is surround sound. And I'd say the battery will last me a good 10-12 hrs of straight usage time.
Can I use it for xbox one?
Audio yes but there is a catch for the mic to work. Unlike the PS4 and PC which work out of the box, you'll need to plug in the included audio cable from the headset to your Xbox One controller for chat to work. It's an xbox limitation and not an Astro limitation.
Does it come with a stand and a mixamp?
Yes, it comes with both the stand and the mix amp, they're both in the box when you buy it
Is Astro support really as bad as many of the reviews on Amazon state?
Absolutely. It took me months to have the issue resolved with my headset, and you can never actually speak to a person directly, only through e-mails that they do not respond to in any decent time frame.
Are these headphones Heavy? I have a pair of turtlebeaches that feel like a ten pound vise grip on my head. I get headaches everytime. Thanks

No it does not but you should be able to buy the cartrhdges sepeeatly and play them on it
Does it play Sega MegaDrive carts?
Yes, this ATGames produced Genesis console will play Japanese Mega Drive games without the need for it to region modded (which is a plus in my book).

can you save games that are part of the 80 original
I dont believe you can. Only thing with my game, i'm having trouble with, is that the wires have a short somewhere and is very touchy. Kinda sucks cause i just bought this recently. Maybe thats why they sold it. Hmmm

As in you want to use this with direct current? You could use adapters for your application, remember to have some sort of breaker in line so you dont destroy anything

It comes with a cheaply produced notecard sized picture of a mammoth tank with some crappy plastic border.

Yes

NO it is pc based check with EA they may have made a mac version but I do not think so
I have Windows 8.1. Can I download and install online, and then play offline whenever I want? Also, do they all play on 8.1? Thanks!
Most play fine on 8.1. I've had trouble with the older games like the original Command and Conquer. Hope this helps.

It should it isn't restricted to the USA. Just a note though: It won't work on Windows 8, but will with Windows 7 & Vista. Probably will with Windows XP as well, but Microsoft has discontinued the support of that now obsolete OS system. :(

It doesn't need Batteries.. is not wireless uses a USB cable
Is the red aiming button on the left side bothersome to some users?
Never used it and the button was firm enough that I never accidentally activated it.
it stops working for no reason. Where I can fix it?
Try RMA through MadCatz, but they are very strict on their warranty/support. Don't be surprised if you get turned away (I did).
How do you bind the thumb wheel to a key?
There is a software disk that comes with this mouse. In that software is where you can bind the thumb wheel to a key. The software only works with Apple and Microsoft op systems.
Does this work with Linux?
I don't think so. The software that comes with it is for Apple and Windows PC. If you are going to use just the normal mouse buttons and not the software to customize the functions then I would think that you would be OK too.
How long is the sale? I'l be able to get this on 5-23-14 if its still $65
I have no idea, i got the gloss black one which is about $95. You should totally go for it, its a great mouse and you will love it. BTW when i got my RAT5 a few years ago it was almost $70...
Is the pinkie rest included?
Yep.
Does it has all its accesories?
it comes with 3 different palm pads, 3 pinky rests/pads, 6 weights, and the allen-key to change it all out.
How long of a cord does it have?
Exactly 72" from exiting the mouse to where it enters the USB connector. Also, I can't in good conscience leave out the fact that these have terrible reliability though. Look up Mad Cats mouse hyper click issues and scroll issues. Their customer support is good though. If you do buy this mouse, keep every available proof of purchase you can for the entirety of its warranty. You'll need it in three months after purchasing...
So i bought this mouse two months ago and now its completely not cooperative. The light turn on, but the cursor is stuck in the middle. i cant move it
You need to uninstall the USB Driver then restart your computer this will not hurt your computer as it will reinstall the drivers automatically when you boot your PC back up here is a link on how to uninstall your USB drives on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8vXprEuAqM Hope this helps I work on and build Custom PC's for a living with over 3.5 years Experience I have my CompTIA A+ Certification and My Crisco Networking Certification Tommy R.

I have 2 of these and the backward button doesn't work on my browsers. I installed the macro software and it didn't help. Anyone else notice this?
My advice is DO NOT buy it again.
Compatible with Os X?
Of course. Any wired mouse is compatable with any operating system as long as your computer has a USB port (Your computer has a USB port).

I dont know... but is a very good mouse! assembled with high quality components
can i turn the light off?
No
Does this feel exactly like the blue e-blue cobra? Same size, weight, etc?
Yes
Has anyone had any trouble with it randomly double clicking and selecting stuff behine open windows or drop down tabs? I have had mine for 1yr.
I had the double clicking happen, then it decided to just quit on me one day. quality is not goof.
How long is the cord on the mouse?
Mine is about 4 and a half feet
COMPARE: Does the 1600 DPI make a big difference for gaming, compared to "E-3lue Mazer Type-R 2500DPI USB Wired Optical Game Gaming Mouse Black-Gray EMS140"? Also, if anyone has compared the two mice above mentioned, is the shape basically identical?...
Cobra DPI switches from 400/800/1600, the Mazer switches from 500/1250/1750/2500. The Cobra is red, Mazer is blue. Other than that they appear very similar. If you like a much higher DPI which is basically more sensitivity, the Mazer would work better.
Can anyone confirm this works on PC?
I can't confirm if it does
Does it fit with a turtle beach?
Yes it does, perfectly. It's actually has the same wire settings for the Xbox controller. In the bottom of the chat pad there is a audio connect for your turtle beach/any other Xbox headset. So yes it does!
Can this work with a wired xbox controller for pc?
I'm not 100% sure but I'd assume it can.
Can any serious gamer here comment on how flawless the sensor in this mouse is? Any (even slight) positive/negative acceleration, angle snapping, etc?
I used this mouse for 2-3 years and the sensor on this mouse is very nice but every once in a while the sensor would skip ever so slightly. But the acceleration, the sensitivity to the clicks, and the programming of the modes is all fantatic. Over all this has to be one of the best mice I have ever owned.
How is the middle click (scroll wheel) on this mouse? Stiff? Light? Is it easy to click without accidentally scrolling at the same time?
The wheel is grooved and the mouse itself is heavy, so it's easy to press the wheel without scrolling or moving the pointer. It gives very little resistance when rolling, just enough that you can feel the grooves; and the wheel won't spin on its own if you flick it.
Is this mouse wired or wireless? I can't quite tell from the pictures.
wired
Is the scroll wheel smooth or regular (tiny or normal rotation for each scroll increment)?
Based on your definition I would call it "regular". The increments between scroll sections are distinct and well felt.
Can this mouse be put in rapid fire mode?
I think this mouse is not for FPS game.. in my opinion..
Can this mouse be put in rapid fire mod?
It has a great ROF and trigger response but rpaid fire to me sounds like a hack. So no it cant shoot faster if you push the click just once
How is this mouse for fingertip grip? Isn't the thumb area too narrow of a space with the buttons and the rest taking too much space?
I thought the same thing until I bought it and it's actually bigger than you would think. It's a comfortable fit and the features are great. I wouldn't use any other type of mouse.
Is this compatible with my HP notebook pc with Windows 7?
It should be. The requirements are as follows: Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows Me, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 Pentium (or compatible) processor 64 MB RAM 20 MB available hard disk space CD-ROM drive USB port

Does this fit with the phone, when it has a case on?
Perfectly! All the way to a Galaxy Note. This thing rocks. Good investment and makes games so much easier. Just get REAL BATTERIES. No cheap ones orb it won't connect at all.
Can I use a an rechargable batteries and does it fit an Galaxy Note II? Because its near 3.2 inch (81 mm) limit?
Idk about the rechargeable batteries but it definitely fits the g-note 2. That's the same phone I use with it.
Do only MOGA games work? Or can I play any games on my phone?
If you're especially tech savy; you can use it with emulators & other games, but you really need to know what you're doing. You can map the buttons & triggers nanually. Personally, I'm very content with the available games, & the list will only grow. Titles like NOVA, Dead Trigger 2 & Aliens vs Predator are amazing with the moga pro...console experience wherever you go. But get the moga pro if your going to get an android controller - it's waaay better (&more comfortable) than the original moga...
Has anyone tried this on the Galaxy S5??
Works perfectly on an S5
Does it still work for emulators?
It works with drastic, John gba, my boy, and a great color emulator but the driver apps are crappie and it doesn't like to stay connected for long if at all. The nyko one is infinitely better..
Can the controller be charged?
It takes ,2 AAA battery
Will it work on emulated games?
I have only used Super GNES through the Google Play Store and it works great. I would make sure that the emulator application you are planning to use supports the Moga platform before you purchase it.
where are the games stored
The unit is used in conjunction with your smart phone, in my case a Galaxy 3. The games are stored in the phone memory
Can you use this as a gamepad for your PC or Mac as well?
Download ZeeMouse from http://www.bitbanksoftware.com/tinytools.html and it will let you map the buttons correctly. Works great!
Is there any way to make this a wired controller with an otg cable? After getting my tablet I noticed that it didn't have bluetooth.
Nope. Not at all. There is no port for this thing, and it doesn't charge over USB either. I can't stress enough exactly how much of a horrible purchase this is. Also, your tablet doesn't have bluetooth? Is it an Android? If it is, it should have bluetooth as an option, but it might not if it isn't one. Still, in all, DO NOT BUY THIS THING. It is a waste of time and money.
My pc cant find the drivers for this, where can I go to download them. Have alienware x51 pc, wont work without installing drivers.
If you have Windows 7, use these instructions,
Is this Raspberry Pi compatible?
Well in not owning a Paspberry Pi I can't answer definitively. But seeing as how it's pretty much a very small computer I would hazard to say that as long as you're able to get the drivers for the the USB receiver on whatever OS you use on the Paspberry Pi you should be good.

No
Can I connect multiple controllers through one reciever?
Yes. 4 controllers and four headsets i believe.

Yes, it does. See other comments/instructions on how to install the drivers. The same steps apply to 7, 8, 8.1.

Yes
Is this unit compatible with 64-bit Operating Systems? I have seen some that are not, and I want to be certain before purchase. Using Win7x64..
Yes, just be sure to download the 64 bit drivers.
Could this also be used with the Xbox 360 Wireless Racing Wheel?
I'm unsure. I'd go with a genuine adapter to T Try that. Just spend the extra X dollars and make life easier for yourself. The fake requires to use old drivers and install manual
Does this work with Windows 8.1?
yes
why wont the 2009 drivers install? just the 2006. From the website.
Because this is a generic model that doesn't accept the driver.

Paul, wish that was an option, I have the Zeus II and it will only play on my computer when a disc from EFX is inserted (it doesn't have to be specifically that disc)

Definitely It is a very good slots game
1. The coins i had one day was not there the next. Anything i can do to keep my last pay balance. Then how do i get more coins from the "bank"
I have never had that problem. Maybe it was a fluke on that one program one time. I suggest if it continues you contact the tech dept. of the publisher. I have found most tech support departments have a great public relations record.

The gem points have given me bonus points or the "cute" prizes that are a part of the game showroom.

3DS games will only work on 3DS gaming system. You can play nintendo ds games on a 3DS gaming system but the way the game cartridge for the 3ds is shaped it won't fit into a ds gaming system. Sorry.
Is it possible to turn off the demon head?
I haven't tried. Very evil if you ask me. I know you can fast forward through the speeches if you press and hold the stylus to the bottom screen when he is speaking.
Is there some way to alter the appearance of the devilish talking head &amp; stop the remarks about my scores?
I dont think theres a way to alter the appearance of the devilish head. What do you mean about "stop the remarks about the scores"? You can try reseting them if thats what youre asking, but they will keep poping out every time you finish a training.
How many save files are there? My girlfriend wants to play as well, can it track multiple people?
Yes! It holds up to 3 save files.
Only it has english language?
As far as I know, it's only in English, but it mostly uses pictures and numbers, so that doesn't matter.
Will this work with a plain old ds player?
No. You will need a 3DS to play this game.
can I play this game using nintendo ds or do i need nintendo 3ds?
You do need the 3ds. Have fun!

New to all of this...can you use on PS3?
You have to have the game specific to your system, but the figures, adventure packs and battle packs will work on any game system.
Which gaming system is this pack compatible with?
I believe it's not system specific. As long as you have a portal and skylanders giants it should be fine. My son uses it on Wii.
will these work with the Wii game
Yes. As long as your playing skylanders giants. These will work with skylanders giants on any system.
how do you use the dragonfire cannon?
place it on the portal with another skylander.
How tall are these figures?
these are the small ones. They are about 2 1/2 to 3 inches tall. There are only 6 of the 5 to 6 inch tall ones in the giants series I believe. I am a very satisfied customer!! HAPPY PLAYING :)
My grandson asked for these figures and I'm really confused. Do you have to have a game system to play with these?
Yes-you need the Skylanders portal and game and system such as Wii, Playstation or Xbox. Make sure you know if Skylanders Giants or Trapteam or Swap Force is actual game he has, as figures only work on certain games. Hope this helps.
Can Chop Chop be used for spyro's adventure, being that he was in the original spyro's adventure game? I understand that shroom boom wouldn't work.
The figure was a gift for my grandson and I know absolutely nothing about the characters or games. I'm sorry I can't answer your question. You might Google the question to see if it will work. Thanks.
Do these work with the skylander giants battle arena?
Yes they do! As they come out with new game the old skylanders still work even with the new game. The new one just don't work with the old games. Example you can't use a swapforce with the giants game but you can use and skylander on the swapforce game. Hope that helps.
is chopchop dragon fire and shroomboom can they be swoped
Sorry, you can't.
Is Battle Pack#1 compatible with the PC version? I would hate to make this purchase for nothing.
I'm really not sure ,sorry I can't help .
I have retarded hands that gush out sweat when I play games. And gush is not an exaggeration. Will this be a problem for RAT? its got alot of crevices
no, i don't think it will be a problem because i sweat when i play games too and it works perfect!
will this work with windows 8 ?
Yes
Its started to freeze and off really often now. might be because a usb cable was so twisted. Can I replace the cable and how?
As far as I can tell there is no replacing of the cable unless you can ship it to Mad Catz.
Does this mouse have left,right and middle scroll buttons ?
Simply only middle mouse.
does this work with mac
The mouse and its software work with Mac OS. Just as a side note, you will have to download the software for the mouse off of their downloads site in order to get the full benefit of the mouse (http://madcatz.com/downloads/).
Does this work with Linux?
I used it on Mint, and got it working, but it didn't perform as well as it did on windows. It broke and they wouldn't honor the warranty so I can't test on my current distro. I would say go with something else for Linux.
I purchased this item from you less than a year ago, and it is now not working. Is there any type of warranty on this product?
I'm pretty sure there is, however I had the same issue and they refused to honor the warranty.
do you ship to mexico?
Hello! We only ship to the US, Canada, UK, France, and Germany.
do you ship to Pakistan ?
Hello! We only ship to the US, Canada, UK, France, and Germany.
Is the Precision Aim Mode button programmable, or can it only be used to drop the DPI?
It can be programmed using the software, but in all honesty this mouse is not worth it. The tracking on it cuts out quite frequently. It just sits in a drawer now because it is too frustrating to use.
I have a 4GB xbox 360 slim and am unable to install battlefield 4. Can I use this HDD and install it?
Yes we had the same problem and this hard drive did the trick. It took about 30 seconds to install and the price is good
can it be install on a xbox 360 model # 1439
Xbox 360 S Console, Model #1439 is what it says on the back of mine and it fits perfectly
After installing, I get disc reading errors and it takes multiple tries for it to read. If I remove it, it reads the disc fine. Is it a bad drive?
No it means that the laser lens needs to be cleaned with a disk with brushes. U can get 1 at the dollar store for 5$ and when you use it, let the whole cd run. I had the same problem till i used a laser lense cleaning disk
does anyone know if this will work in the xbox 360 E
Yes, but the drive won't play older games
can I download and play destiny with this hard drive?
Yes
does this work to install destiny?
Yes
When I transfer content, does it mess up my game saves and data?
Not at all. It's basically a 60gb flash drive for your xbox. You just go through the content on your console and move it to the hard drive. It's really quite simple and does not do anything to your content.
When I put in this hdd, will my xbox 360 slim recognize it?
Yes, it slides in and works
Stupid question but i need to know if there are directions for the install? I'm not tech savvy at all lol
No tech knowledge required. Just pull pull the plastic panel off the the bottom of other Xbox and slide the drive in. There is only one way it will fit. Do a search on YouTube and you can see a quick video. It is super easy.
Just bought an xbox 360, it says it is xbox 360 E console but is E the same as the slim model?? If so will this Hard Drive fit in that xbox 360?
Yes it will. it fits in slims models and 4gb models. I bought mine about 3 months ago and am very happy with it.
Will this controller work with the original Wii? Or is it just for the Wii U?
This controller is for the Wii U only and will not work when playing Wii games on the Wii U.
i am buying the deluxe set wiiu do i need a pro controller
You actually don't, most games have plenty of compatible controllers. I would recommend buying the pro controller if you find yourself uncomfortable with the wiipad.
Will this game work with Wii games such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the Wii U?
I regret to inform you that it doesnt work at all after you boot the "wii" app on the wii u, I have both smash bros brawl and smash bros the first for N64, neither works
How would compare this controller to the DualShock 3?
Its less sensitive than the Dualshock. It lasts longer than the dualshock and surprisingly it feels a bit comfortable than the dualshock. Theyre both great controllers but I can see the Wii U pro lasting a lot longer in quality.
does the controller have rumble?
Yes!
Compared to the other controllers, does this one have the motion stuff? (Can i steer a car my tilting or shake it for Wii U Party)
You cannot. The wii u pro controller has no motion controls built in.
Do I need an adapter to use this controller like the Gamecube controllers?
Nope! It's the receiver is built into the Wii U just like Xbox and Sony have done
Never had a Wii, so I plan to use the Wii U to also play a few Wii games (via back compat). Can I use this controller or do I need something else? TIA
The Wii U Pro controller is only designed for Wii U games. Wii games on Wii U can only be played with controllers that were supported by the regular Wii, such as the regular Wiimote, wiimote+nunchuck, or the Classic Controller Pro. The Wii U also does not have slots for a gamecube controller so those can't be used as well. You'll need a wiimote, the good news is that a lot of Wii U games actually support this older controller and it can be used to navigate Wii U menus so it wouldn't be a bad purchase http://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Wii-Remote-Plus-Black/dp/B0094X28J0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412875287&sr=8-1&keywords=wiimote
Can this controller be used to play Wii u virtual console games?
Yes it can, but for wii virtual console games, you'll need a classic controller. For Wii U though, it should work with any vc game.
Does the Charging Cable connect to the system and acts like a wired controller? Having the responsiveness of a wired one, or is it just a charging cab
I have not done responsive test with controller connected to system.
Are you supposed to hear yourself through the TV speakers? It detects my voice pitch but I cannot hear myself even when the mic volume on full
I haven't had that problem. I do hear my voice through the TV speakers.
Does this work with a regular wii system as well as wii u?
No, only for WII U
how long is the cable?
16ft
Can you use this microphone with a wii game or just with wii u games? We have a wii u but want to use it with Beatles Rock Band Wii game. Thanks
Can only be used with Wii u products, as far as i know. I know the microphone can only be used that way.
Trying to use this on wii u with dance party 2014 and it doesn't seem to work? Is there a setup of any kind?
We don't have dance party, but on the other wii u sing party, it was just a plug and play and the mic worked great!
I was thinking of using this microphone for something else. What type or size of plug in does it have?
It's actually a USB plug. XLR would be nice, though.
CAN it be used with Just Dance king along on wii u? Does it plug into game pad?
It's plugs into the console not the pad. I don't know about the rest
I know that the box says "no," but will this mic work with the wii (as in not the wii u)?
I don't think so, this microphone was made for the wii u. I don't have a regular wii but u can check to see if the wii has a port u can plug in before u purchase.
does it work with just dance 2015
We hooked it up yesterday and it seemed to work with the game. It was a little quiet but that was probably user error.
Can you use this Microphone for the PC? if so, what do you have to do to make it work? (looking to use for recording my voice)
No it's junk. Doesn't work period
Does it works in wii games at the Wii u's wii mode?
No it does not, It's made for Wii U only.
Does this controller have a rumble feature and motion gyro inside like the gamepad? (Thinking of getting this for Zelda)
Yes it does! Rumble is here to stay. Although, over the ages and various controllers it differs from numbing like a pager to hard hitting. This is a middle ground. Gyro sensor is not in the controller - it's not like a wii mote, or six axis knockoff. It's a pure controller with analogs, digitals, and rumble. 80 hours of battery life too!
Does the Wii U Pro controller's analog sticks "click" like a button if you press them, i.e. does it have L3/R3 functionality?
Yes they do..best Wii u controller
how does this connect to the gamepad?
It doesn't. They're both just controllers.
is the controller region free ? can it be used with both pal and ntsc models?
As far as I'm aware, the pro controller should be region free. The gamepad however is region locked
How does the pro controller connect to the gamepad
The game pad that comes with the system uses a propietary connection type USB cable. The pro controller uses a mini USB cable. You can't interchange the two. The pro controller connects wirelessly to the console, but uses the cable for charging; same as the game pad. The game pad and pro controller do not connect to each other.
Can the wii u controller work on android tablets and phones like the other controllers can?
No
Can it be also connected to the PC?
It can't be used as a PC controller conventionally (though of course there are people who have made it work through various outside means).
1# Is this wireless? 2#Old school here and have wavebird wireless that was used on GameCube and Wii is there anything out there so I can use wavebird?
An extension controller is often used for the corresponding software. I can be connected to the main body up to four wireless.
dos it play wii gams or only wii u games
it plays wii games also!
It says it plays almost all wii games. Which ones does it not play? Sports Resort? Sport? Fit Plus? Lord of Rings? Harry Potter? Spiderman cube
Hi M.J., I'm not entirely sure why it says 'almost' all Wii games. The Wii U actually has a Wii menu. When you select this Wii menu from the Wii U home screen, it looks exactly as the original Wii's home menu does. From here, you are able to play any Wii games you have, so long as you have the Wii remote and/or nunchuk that are required for the specific game because the Wii U gamepad cannot be used as a controller for original Wii games. Also, according to Nintendo's website, Wii games will not display in HD on the Wii U console, just as they wouldn't on the original Wii. So overall you should not have a problem playing any of your Wii games on the Wii U as long as they are not scratched or damaged too badly. Hope this helps.
Why is this one $10 more than the one that comes with mario and luigi U?
It depends on where you buy from, a lot of different online stores in amazon charge different prices. If you are comparing 2 prices from amazon, one console might be on sale.
Can this stream netflix and amazon prime videos?
Yes it can!
I have the Wii fit unit. what do I need to be able to use the wii u fitness dvds? i.e. Pilates, etc.
All the peripheral devices from the wii work with the U, including the balance board. Original wii games also work on the U, including wii fit. However, the new wii fit U is a great upgrade from the original
Can I use the original Wii controllers (The ones that are NOT "plus controllers") with the Wii U?
Yes you can.
If our wii console still works, what is the benefit of buying a wiiU?
The Wii U and Wii are totally different systems, the names make that confusing. While Wii games will play in a Wii U, Wii U games will NOT play in a Wii. Sorry if that seems obvious, I've had a lot of confused friends who thought the Wii U was just some kind of add on and not a new system. The Wii U is in true HD, with HDMI out. It's also not dependent on the motion controls any more, so a lot more games make use of the pro controller, a lot like the older pro controller for the Wii minus the need to plug it into the remote. That being said most games allow you to pick your control type, so if you loved tilt controls in Mario Kart Wii you can still use them, like the pro controller you can use that too. I owned a Wii and I've had a Wii U for a little while now and I would say the quality of the games for the Wii U is much much higher. Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3 and Super Smash Bros Wii U are, for my money, the best yet in their respective lines. Also the new games are outstanding, such as Hyrule Warriors and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker. The Wii U also introduces the ability to buy any game as a digital download, same day as the stores. Most big releases even get a midnight digital release! The Wii U interacts with the amiibos, that besides being awesome figures unlocks content in Nintendo games! The Wii U takes everything good about the Wii and makes it amazing!
how many people can play at once?
Four if you have enough controllers.
Is the game pad the only controller compatible?
It is backwards compatible with ALL Wii mote controllers (original and with Wii motion Plus), along with all the accessories for the Wii Mote (like classic controller Pro). It does not natively support GameCube controllers but with the new adapter (shown in E3 2014) it will support both wired and wireless GameCube controllers.
how many gamepad controllers needed for wii u?
At this time only one gamepad is supported. Wii remotes can be used for additional players. Watch out for unscrupulous sellers like Sadpolar7 selling the "Deluxe Set" without the gamepad. The system needs the gamepad to work. SCAM!
Is this controller compatible with consoles sold in U.S.?
yep
Is this an official Nintendo product?
Yes, this is an official Nintendo product. However, please be aware that (as indicated by the picture) this is the Japanese model. As such, you'll notice the text on the box is in Japanese. I have not noticed any compatibility issues whatsoever. For that matter, the controller feels and responds exactly like my US version Pro controller. No discernible difference, other than the text on the back of the controller also being in Japanese.
is it compatible for pc ?
Use this driver: http://www.wiinupro.com/ (If you have a bluetooth with the Toshiba Bluetooth Driver stack, like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-V2-1-EDR-Nano-Adapter/dp/B0029L4BE4), or this adapter: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E6553PW.
Is this compatible with Wii games played on WiiU?
Nope, Wii games played on the Wii U must be played with Wii controllers. You can pick up the Wii Classic Pro Controller and a Wii mote, but as for the Wii U Pro controller, that can only be used with compatible Wii U games.
I accidentally ordered this one... will this work alright with an NA console and how difficult is it to feel my way through syncing, since its in JPN?
It works perfectly fine with the NA console. Syncing the controller is very simple, its just pressing the sync button on the back of the game pad and the sync button on the Wii u console itself.
Does this take AA batteries?
No. It has a built in battery that is charged via a USB cable that is included.
Is this controller compatible with Mario Kart 8? And Bayonetta?
Yes with both games
Does the Pro Rumble?
Yes
Is this controller compatible with Hyrule Warriors?
Absolutely. It makes playing easier overall.
it says shipping will come in decemeber and thats in 2 months but it listed 7-10 days shipping? anyone who bought this now how long it takes? im in us
Ships from japan. You can choose the delivery method. STANDARD SHIPPING ( by Air ) - no tracking & not insured ( 10 - 28 business days). EXPEDITED SHIPPING( EMS )- tracking & insured ( 5 - 12 business days).
I hear that there can be a Party of Four at a time. Is the CPU-Controlled, or do you have to have your friends tag along?
You have to have friends with you. How evere you can have one frind and both of you can bring a Shakalaka with you ether Cha-Cah or Kayamba with you and they are CPU- Controlled.
Is monster hunter 3 ultimate be used with the circle pad pro &amp; will it make the game more enjoyable to play?
ABSOLUTELY!! The Circle Pad Pro means you don't have to use the touch pad to work the camera controls, so it makes the game 100 times easier to play. Just make sure that you have a 3DS that the Circle Pad Pro will fit because it will not fit a 3DS XL. (They made a Circle Pad Pro later on that would fit the XL, but I don't know if they still make it.)
Is monster hunter 3 Ultimate for 3ds easy to play?
To be honest, no. It's difficult, but difficult in a way that's often very rewarding for a player when the time and effort is put in to learn monster attack patterns and optimal attack strategies per weapon. There are guides all over the internet and on YouTube to help a new player out with these things; I recommend ProJared's Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate videos for help starting out, and then a good search of whatever weapons a new player wants to pick up to see them in action. My first night playing I knew nothing and it took several hours for my group to down our first big monster, but then I watched, listened and practiced and the next night we played I was fantastic, knew where to go, how to hit and was prepared for everything that could be thrown at us. It's not easy to play, but it feels really, really good when you start to master it.
In the demo the missions are timed. Is it timed in the real game?
Yes. All missions have a time limit. However you can go into Moga Woods for "free hunt" which is not timed and stay there as long as you'd like.
online
The 3DS version is only capable of playing locally with other 3ds or Wii U users. The Wii U version is capable of playing online. I hope this helps :)
It this game just for online multiplayer or I can play a single mode?
The 3ds version can only play in lan and solo the online quests so in fact almost the entire game is offline!!
Is this game multilingual?
Yes
If my son gets this game &amp; a 3D-XL for Xmas, but the other has only a regular DS-XL, can they still play together? or do both need 3DS players?
They both need 3ds systems. To my knowledge 3ds/2ds systems are backward compatible but a Nintendo DS can't run a 3ds game.
I have a 9yr old asking for this game, would this be appropriate and do you think it would be too difficult?
This game would be a bit difficult but if he has friends to play with (it's a great multiplayer game) it wont be too hard. There's no gore or gratuitous violence at all, so it's very appropriate for all ages in my opinion. I really love this game :)
do you have to play with friends
No
Is this playable with just a keyboard?
Yes, however if you played the originals on console, a controller would be much more comfortable.
Is this game compatible with an Xbox 360 controller? Many PC games are.
I actually think it's required. Not 100% sure on that, but I can confirm I use a controller with it.
Does this work for Windows 8?
I don't see why it wouldn't. I installed it a while ago when I bought it for Steam. Windows 8 has the same folder structure as Windows 7 and Vista, but only a different Start menu. There should be no reason this doesn't work.
- Does this game have multiplayer mode?
nope

Can this connect directly to an iPhone wirelessly, or is the receiver needed?
It needs to be plugged in to the transmitter for it to work wirelessly This is not a Bluetooth device but it does work with the cord nicely. The receiver is USB 2.0 with a 3.5 mm male adapter if you want to plug your phone in to the wireless connection.
do these work with xbox one
yup and they have about 30-40 feet before they lose signal.
Are these Headphones over ear or on ear?
Slightly over ear
Whuch are better these or the PDP afterglows Kral Wireless headset?
Hey Juana, Now that you mentioned it, it looks like I might have placed this headset under the wrong product. The headset I am selling is actually the PDP Afterglow Kral PS4 Wireless Headset - not the Afterglow Universal Wireless Headset. I think the Afterglow Universal Wireless Headset can't be used with Playstation 4. I will place this listing under the correct product.
will theseps4 compatiable
They work with our TV, sound system, PS4, XBOX, even the home computer. They work so well I got my brother his own for Christmas.
I broke that green x-box cord. Does anyone know where I can get a replacement?
Go to the afterglow website and u can order a new one
Do these work with a PS3?
Yes they do
is this rely worth the money to buy it, when i can get similar quality for cheaper?
I didn't pay quite this much and I don't know what you are comparing to. I'm pleased with their performance
can this headset be used on ps4
Most of the reviews seem to say it does NOT work with PS4.

Does it work on Windows 8.1 and does it come with a CD?
Yes it does work on Windows 8.1. It does not come with a CD. You have to download an N64 emulator of your choice and then plug in your controller. Once the controller is plugged in and windows recognizes the controller, you can go into your key configurations under the settings in the emulator and edit the keys yourself. Some emulators do require you to manually enter each key one at a time. The product works amazingly. Bought 4 myself and have it all running on my PC.
Does this have a "rumble pak" built into it?
No it does not. It feels lighter than the Nintendo 64 controller as well. Basically it is the Nintendo 64 controller shell and a circuitboard in the middle. I bought both the grey and black. Great purchase in my opinion.
Is it possible to use two of these at a time and play multiplayer games?
Yes, though it really depends on what emulator you use. I use project 64 and it goes up to four. What emulator do you use?
I ordered two of these and they work great BUT the joysticks keeps coming off on BOTH. Any quick and easy solutions?
I have had the same issue. Try either using a dab of superglue on the metal part where the joystick slides on, or for a less intrusive method, use a small piece of paper towel between the metal part and the joystick. Hopefully, part of the paper towel will get wedged between the metal stick and the inside of the joystick, strengthening the bond. Hope this helps.
Can you get this to run on Android? I have one arriving and didn't think to check.
As long as you have a USB 2.0 and you should be fine. Just when you go into the key bindings hit the button on the controller, I found it was as simple as that.
When I connect the controller to my PC it installs the driver but it wont recognize it in the game controller menu. Please help.
What emulator are you using? Did you put the mini DVD in your computer.
Since this controller is USB, would it work for the Xbox 360?
no
Will this work on a Mac using OpenEMU?
i don't know i use windows 7 xp and 8 but it comes with a software disk so try it the emulator i use is project 64 and they have updates as well sorry i do not know much about macs
Can this be used in place of mouse for regular computer use like browsing the internet?
Sure, all joysticks can be used as mouse device on Windows platform, this can be made with third-party software such as JoyToKey of Joystick-To-Mouse. Enjoy!
i pluged it into the computer it says the usb device is not recognized ive put in the cd and installed the hardware it still doesnt work why?
Because you have to go into your emulator settings and manually set the keys to the emulator. You can't expect your computer and a CD to do all of your work for you considering you are most likely trying to play games that are illegally obtained. Open your emulator and go to your controller settings and manually enter each key in. When you go to the settings it will display all the controls and what they are set to on your keyboard as this is a default universal controller to all computers.
does it play Japanese games
Yes. The PS3 is "region free", however if you plan on buying any downloads for those games, you would have to buy them from the Japanese Playstation Store.
Sorry you put only "500GB PS3 System" this is the super slim Playstation?
This Playstation has the sliding top disc tray instead of a disc slot.
can this play Blu ray video?
Yes plays Blu ray and DVD and burn DVDs
Is compatible with move?
Yes
does it play ps1 games and ps2 games too?
Sorry friend, no backwards compstibility, I'm afraid. Use the PS store/Amazon to get your fix. PS1 digital downloads are cheap and there are HD remasters of old PS2 games available for the PS3. Happy gaming!
how can i know this will work with a 220V power input...pliz help and be very precise
Transformers aren't needed, the PS3 has a universal PSU.
does hookup to analog tv? also, can get pandora and netflix?
With analog TV is ok. Netflix, only suscribe credit card before to play app
I was looking in my cellphone in the Amazon's app and in the feature and details is writing that this ps3 comes with 3 games. Is it true?
This one does not. What sets this one apart from the one with two or three games is that this comes with 500 gigs of memory and the others come with much less.
How reliable is the Super Slim? For those who owned it for a while, does it give you any problems? Also how loud is it when it plays discs?
Very good item
Does it comes with Netflix?
Netflix will be preinstalled, but you have to log in or make a new account. New accounts will get a 1 month free trial. Service is 8.99 a month for streaming video.
What is the model of this console? Does this still have the original firmware version?
Yes It has the original firmware, But when you connect the console for the first time, begins to be updated
Because this is listed as "new," does it include the manufacturers warranty on top of the seller warranty?
It did not have a manufacturer's warranty and even though it was listed as "new" my console was in "like new" status only. Very clean, works well. But no warranty. Though with sony's new system you can purchase an additional warranty these days for about 50$
Does it come with controllers?
Yes, it comes with one controller
can I use my ps2 games in it
Unfortunately you can't use PS2 games on the PS3. It would be a huge selling point if you could though!
what is the Quantity of weight of console
couple lbs
does the product come with a controler
Yes but only one
On the infamous collection game is it just one disk?
No its two discs. Its in sleeves like if you got a used game at gamestop. It dont cases
Does the product come in it's original packaging?
This product comes in the special edition box you see and the games come in small sleeves
How big is this mouse? Full grip? I have big hands and don't like having to use claw grip when mice are too small.
I have pretty big hands and when i palm the mouse my fingers don't go past the side. It gives a nice, full feel when holding it.
Can the LED's be turned off completely?
Yes they can. In the settings you have an option to change the colors, the way it pulsates, and also just turning them off completely.
I was wondering on a level 1-10 how loud the clicks are? odd question but gaming annoys the girl friend lol
I believe it has omron switches. Not sure on the scaling, just sounds normal. Much like my old logitech g500. Based on your last statement, its probably not the clicking. Try screaming at the game more it will cover the mouse and fans.
What is the difference between this and the kone pure?
lights in the Kone pure are on the logo itself not the sides, while in the XTD it's on the sides (4 LEDs) while the logo is a silversih color only, not lit up also you sacrifice one more button, the button infront of the scroll wheel, it counts as 2 buttons with the shift + functionality, other than that it's the aesthetic looks
What is the longest you have used this mouse (not just owning) without having any problems (espeically in the scroll wheel department)?
Every once in a while the mouse will "wander" or "drift". It's correctable by unplugging it then re-plugging it in to the USB port. I've not noticed any problems specifically with the scroll wheel. I've also never mapped any of the other buttons, so I can't say how well they work.
Does Roccat have a warranty? I've read horror stories about not honoring warranty?
I haven't had any issue of the sort and my friend who had to RMA his didn't have a problem during the procedure, either.
How is the size of this compared to a Logitech G9? I have a small hand, and use a palm grip, and currently have a G9.
I got this for my husband, he has a large hand and it fits him great. Not sure of the G9's size though
can i use it on macbook?
Yes. You just need a USB port, which every computer does
Is there functionality to switch the DPI (CPI) on the fly? Such as a precision aiming button found on other comparable gaming mice?
There are two buttons right under the scroll wheel that were made with that in mind. They have '+' and '-' on them respectively, and are set to adjust DPI to whatever you like in the default setup. You can, however, change the function of the two to whatever else you can think of, so there is a lot of versatility.
Does this mouse have an accurate scroller? Meaning that its not that sensitive and scrolls very easily
It's kindof tough, but as any mouse requires a little breaking in.
Could someone list all the dlc that comes with the game?
Shark Attack Pack, Z Style Pack, The Trouble With Clones, Genkibowl VII, Gangstas in Space, Penthouse Pack, Invincible Pack, Genki Girl Pack, Funtime! Pack, Explosive Combat Pack, Special Ops Vehicle Pack, Moneyshot Pack, Steelport Gangs Pack, Witches and Wieners, Warrior Pack, Nyte Blayde Pack, Horror Pack, CheapyD, Online Pass.
if i have regular version then buy this version will it still work
Yes.
If I have the SR3 downloaded version from Xbox Live, can I just install the bonus content disc and play without the game disc? SR3 was a freebie for Gold members in June 2014 and I would like both my wife and I to have the DLC without having to run the...
It should work.
Does this game has two disks or codes for the DLCs?
Yes the game comes with a disc for dlc
So the base has to be connected to the computer at all times for the wireless function to work?
yes.
Whats the warranty length on this mouse? 1 year or 3 months? I have 6 more days until ive had it a year and it died.
One year
Does it need a receiver / micro usb or does it work on bluetooth? I don't know how to use it wireless.
Included in the box is the mouse, base, and USB cable. To use the wireless function, plug the USB cable into your computer and into the back of the base. You then sync up the mouse to the base and your good to go. Be careful though. The base tends to be really picky about which USB port you plug it into.
Where can I get a replacement usb cable for this mouse? Mine shorted out.
You can most likely find a suitable one at Walmart. I know the one for this mouse has more of a squared and thinner end, so that's what you should look for. You can always buy a few different ones and return the ones that don't fit. Good luck.
Does this mouse use a standard rechargeable battery type (AA, AAA, etc) or does it use a proprietary battery?
It uses a built in battery, cant remove it, the base this mouse comes with also charges it, but battery should never really be an issue, the mouse also has an input hole, you can play while you charge.
Like the WoW cata mmo gaming mouse, is the sarface of the mouse going to start rubbing away?
I used one for 15 months or so.... never had wear problems at all. Really enjoyed the wired one. Not so much the wireless. I was disappointed with their support. Went to all Razer products. That said the wired version was excellent quality and is still on my shelf as a backup to my Razer Ouroboros.
How much time you can play from a single battery charge?
Well I play usually 6 or 8 hours, then simply redock it in the charger. I've not left it undocked to know how long it lasts. I'm sorry!
Any ideas on how to lengthen the life of the battery? Like turning the lights down? Any thoughts are welcome.
Like rat 9. Put another battery in charger and we can change anytime.
Does this mouse still work the same for left handed people?
It should work, but not effectively. There are 4 or so buttons that you use your thumb to click, though I suppose you could use your pinky to use them. But that's only if you plan on using it to game fully- I use mine as a regular mouse without using many of the extra buttons ;) So it depends on your intended use.
Do you know if you can use this mouse with Windows 8?
It will work with any computer with a usb port. That has windows xp or later. It will recognize the mouse but, you will have to go to the steelseries website and download mouse's program. To set the mouse functions for a specific game. I have mine set for diablo 2 and diablo 3. It has the option of working connected by wire or wireless.
Does this game work on PS Vitas in the US?
Yeah Vita is region free. I played it on my US Vita. It's just the DLC you'll have to worry about. If you want that your Vita need to be using a japanese account to use the DLC.
Does this version have English subtitles or just the limited edition
The one I bought here was all Japanese, though I do know there is a American limited edition.
Does it have english
No.
Are the vendors on Amazon selling the 'no region protection' copy of this game?
if they aren't selling the region free one just go on play-asia and buy the game from there they have a region-free version there for sell.

Is this a wired or wireless mouse? I have read online that this is a Hybrid with both features, but the pictures look like a wired mouse.
It's a wired mouse.
Does the "intelligent software" work on Mac OS?
No it doesn't. None of the extra buttons work, so you can only use it like a "regular" mouse. That didn't stop me from buying it though :)
Does this mouse support free-scrolling scroll wheel? (like when you spin a wheel on a skateboard, how it keeps spinning)
No it does not. The wheel actually has firm 'clicking' as you spin the wheel.
Can you use macros for often-used text insertion? Thanks.
Yes, I believe you can
is that work for mac (OSX system)?
In terms of plug and play yes, however I don't believe the software suite will be compatible with Mac.
There is no list of the games in the product details. Can you list them please?
Sure,Over 30 Midway classics on one disc in HD,they are as follows....(some of which haven't been included in previous Midway collections. Several games, including 720, Gauntlet and Marble Madness were made by Atari, so it's interesting to see them included in this collection.) Defender Gauntlet Joust Rampage Total Carnage 720 A.P.B. Arch Rivals Bubbles Championship Sprint Tournament Cyberball 2072 Defender II Gauntlet II Joust 2 Marble Madness Pit-Fighter Rampart Robotron 2084 Root Beer Tapper Satan's Hollow Sinistar Smash TV Spy Hunter Spy Hunter II Super Off Road Super Sprint Toobin' Vindicators Part II Wizard of Wor Xenophobe Xybots
Does it have gauntlet?
Yes it does
Would this be over kill for games such as this? Qanba Q4 Q4RAF Ice Blue PS3 &amp; Xbox 360 &amp; PC Joystick (Fightstick)
I don't think so, in fact, it will get you closer to the feel of the original arcade games. Hope this helped.
Does this include the Arcade version of Smash TV? Not the rated G SNES version right?
Yeah its the arcade version
Can this be played on the ps4?
no
No Galaga!! Know where I can get it?
Nope...I was disappointed to
There is no list of games in the product details. Can I get a list of the games included?
Im working now but first chance i will get back to you or bring the game up on google they may have the list of games on it there.
Does it have Galaga?
There should be a list of games in product info or on peoples' reviews. As far as I know it does NOT have Galaga.
Does it have root beer tapper
Yes and its sooo awesome!
Can Cyberball be played online?
No
does revelations come with the 3 DLC's???? and does brotherhood come with da vinci disapperance??
No. Only AC2 comes with DLC.
good morning I wanted to know if this trilogy are video games or play 3 games .... if they would make the purchase ... excuse my English I am from Ven
They are three separate game all around EZIO as the main character. All the games are on the disc but need to be downloaded as all the data could not fit on the disc. As long as you have space on your PS3 hard drive you will be fine.
is this a 3 games full disc set?? or the games are for download?
This is the full trilogy on one disc
Are all three games on the disk or is only one on the disk and the rest have to be downloaded?
All come with the disc but the first two need to be fully installed (not from the Internet just from the disc) revalations is the only one that doesn't require a full install to play
So you have to download two of the games to the HD to play them but is that from the disc or online like a DLC?
They install from the disc, but you still have to have the disc inside the PS3 to play the games. All 3 games are on one disc, brotherhood is the only game that can be played straight from the disc.
Does this have the templar lairs dlc from Assassins Creed 2?
Yes
I own the Ezio trilogy and have downloaded the 2 online games. If I sell the disk, will the new player be able to download those 2 games?
As far as I know, yes. I bought this game used and I played all three games. Assassins creed 2 and brotherhood aren't actually downloads. They are on the disc but requires aa full install to play them.
Do you need to download patches like the stand alone disc releases of the included games?
I did not have to download any patches besides install ac2 and ac brotherhood, i would have to say no
Does the trilogy have uplay points which you can earn?
Yes it does have uplay points im not sure ypu can earn it but when i was playing it would say i won this and that
este juego esta en ingles o en espa&ntilde;ol?...o si se puede cambiar(this game is in english or in spanish?
It has both languages in it
Does this work on windows 8?
Yes it works beautifully on my Windows 8 device! Some of the games (Red Alert 2 in this case) will refuse to open up once they are tabbed down but otherwise the games run well!
Only English version or full language version?
I have no idea...The one sent to me is in German...
If I download this game on my current computer and eventually upgrade to a new pc, will I be able to transfer the game ?
Yes you can. Just log in to your Amazon account and re-download the game client. Very easy to do.. If you have the product key saved you can even do it from the orbit game console thing.
I love Red Alert and Red Alert 2/Yuri's Revenge. Will they run on 8.1? I had problems with the decades edition where they wouldn't open.
Work fine on mine though you can't ult tab or minimize or you won't be able to open it back up.
I installed RA2/Yuri's Revenge and got to the game selection screen and clicked both games but nothing happened. How do I fix this?
There are a few steps to follow, and this link may help, but I will tell you what I did (http://answers.ea.com/t5/Command-Conquer-The-Ultimate/Info-How-to-run-older-Command-amp-Conquer-titles-on-Windows-8-1/m-p/4236614#U4236614) 1. Open up your task manager and end all command and conquer games and processes 2. Open up your Origin client 3. In the upper left hand corner click on Origin and click on Application Settings 4. Uncheck "Enable Origin Game" (if it is grayed out, be sure you shut down all Command and Conquer games in the task manager) The link above will also give you some tips on getting it to run, but try what I typed out first as it fixed my issues. Also, if you alt-tab out of the game, you will not be able to get back in without shutting it down via your task manager.
is it included command and conquar zero hour ?
Yes sir it is.
Does this game download work on Windows XP too?
Yes it does, it works on all windows os's from 95 and up. Hope you buy it you'll love it.
Can I play a local LAN game with other people who purchase / download this game?
Yes sure.
This is in the Mac Games section, but I don't see any OS / hardware requirements...so, what are the requirements?
Not sure about mac, i have it running on windows 8. I have a hard copy of generals and that actually works fine, Amazon had a great deal on the package so i thought it would be great to have a digital back up of my favorite of the series but it wont load through origin. I haven't tried them all but Red Alert 3 plays fine through origin.
will it work for mac?
No it's Windows only and requires the software from origin.com, runs in a boot camp partition though!

Where do you install the application for the mouse? To change colors?
http://www.cmstorm.com/en/support/downloads/156/
how big is this mouse? i have a logitech g600, does anybody know how big it is compared to that?
I don't know the size comparison, but here it is next to a deck of playing cards - http://imgur.com/oB7hsuG
Does it work with windows 8?
It should. The mouse has been out for a while the cooler master is a big company, i'm sure they would have updated their drivers if necessary. Mice usually don't need externally installed drivers to have basic functionality, so i don't think it would be a problem at all.
Does the scroll wheel have a left and right click function?
Nope. Just up down. It is a nice wheel though, for me at least. Of course there is a mouse 3 if you click down on it.
Is this ergonomic?
very
Does this mouse support free-scrolling scroll wheel? (like when you spin a wheel on a skateboard, how it keeps spinning)
No, it does not have a free scroll wheel.
Can the LEDs be turned off?
Each of the various DPI settings has a corresponding color. The LED is only completely turned off when the DPI is on the lowest setting, otherwise there is always a color.
As a right handed user, do the side buttons on the right side get in the way when playing games? Does your finger rest on them thus pressing them?
When I first got the mouse, it was a "problem" and one that was really annoying, but after a while I changed the way I gripped this particular mouse . Keep in mind you can always set those buttons to do nothing via the included software if needed.
Is this the product is retail packing or bulk?
Its nice retail packaging. Nice and sturdy with no wear or discoloration.
What are the dimensions of this mouse? I know its kinda specific. but i kinda want to know the width length and height
This is directly from the box: 116.4 x 64.4 x 42 mm
Comparing this to the razer abyssus, which creates louder clicking sound?
By far in my opinion since my twin brother got the abyssus at the same time as I got the Drakonia I would say the Drakonia has much louder clicking. Not to say that it's a bad thing or anything, but it is louder. The only thing I like about the abyssus over the Drakonia is the material that the top of the mouse is made of. It has better grip for your hand, but in terms of functionality and ergonomics the drakonia wins hands down.
what kind of surface does it do good on?
I ended up buying the gaming surface made by the same company but I tried it on a standard mouse pad. Works fine either way. I just bought theirs b/c it gave me a lot more real estate to work with.
Will this work on a mac with all functions. Just need right, left and center click and 4 way scroll
Well Jellicoe, I have no clue if this Mouse will work on Mac because I don't use Mac. The only Mac I use is Mac and Cheese. I appologize for not being able to answer your question. Good Day
Is it compatible with Mac? or Windows 8?
It is compatible with windows 8 for sure.I am not sure about mac...
WIll this increase my no scope abilities?
Only if you are a man 360 no scoper
Can someone tell me how long the cord is on this keyboard? please and ty!
Cable Length is 150cm (4"9 ft)
Someone said that the CD is a mini CD. I have an HP TouchSmart 300. The CD not have a tray, the CD's slide into a CD slot. Will I be able to use the mini CD?
There is good news and bad news. The bad news is I looked it up and what I found was don't insert the Mini CD into the slot. The good news is you don't need to instal the CD to use the keyboard. You only install I if you want to program the keys.
Will this be a good keyboard for work? I Are the keys close enough together for quick typing, and is it comfortable to type?
You could use it for some light word processing stuff; I've used it for a few short papers. Its relatively comfortable to type on but it really wasn't designed with that in mind, therefore the keys are very loud and have a slick plastic feel to them which can get annoying. If you're looking for a keyboard solely for word processing, I'd look elsewhere.
For macro how much Key/Character presses per macro(1) how much key/character per macro??
no idea what the max is, messed with it once, stopped at like 20 keys. so I think you are good, there just aren't any extra keys so use a key that you never would use.
For what keys are there rollover support?
It doesn't respond well to the dual modifier keys test about 60% work, but with a single modifier key and multiple normal keys including F keys it works fine not including the number pad. Modifier Keys + Z + XCVBNM&lt;&gt;?ASDFGHJKL:"}{POIUYTREWQ!@#$%^&*()_+| | F1-F12 Up Down Left Right Apps Right/Left Windows Alt Ctrl Modifier Keys + Many keys as I can hold down and type still works as well Normal char keys many as I can hold down and the rest of the keyboard works as long as it's the first keys are not modifiers. If you tell me what you need to work exactly I'll try it for you and even download the game if it's not giant like 20GB. I already I have a huge lib of mmorpg, fps, rhythm, and bullet hell. If your game is of that genre I most likely have it installed. As for the keyboard itself it's a bit banged up today, but still going strong and I've hit over the 10 million press mark alone on the Q W A S D E keys and over 8 on Up Down Left Right. What can I say I'm a gaming junkie and I've wore the rubber off lol. -Andrew
progaman the lights to change color to red?
Only one led and it is blue
Mac compatible?
It is mac compatable. but i dont think the install cd will work seeing as it is an Exe, but i could be wrong
Is this has LED illumination.?
No
I am seeing conflicting answers for this, si I want to know: Is this a mechnaical keyboard? Or are the "Gaming Keys" Mechanical? Would like to know.
Not mechanical. Gaming keys are rubberized ove I was happy with it. No complaints other then wasd keys are a pain to type with so I leave em off. Long coord for usb. Suggest watching a YouTube video before purchasing. Hope you found out what you wanted any other questions feel free to reply. In class atm but nothing to do so not a bother lol. Have a good day.
2 Questions: 1. Any problems with keys sticking on this keyboard? 2. Is the wrist support piece removable? Thanks.
Question1: Nope, but you can remove them and clean them if you like too with the key remember that it comes with and for question 2 yea it does remove. Have a nice one
I have this keyboard and would love to know if i could get a rubberized Lshift and Lctrl key. does anyone know where to get them?
probably off the sharkoon website or just get some third party keys. BTW, is this keyboard good? i just wanted to know because im starting to build my pc and i want a cheap, but good keyboard. Will this basically fit the standard needs of a regular keyboard and a keyboard to play some light games like minecraft, steam games, ect.? thanks i would love to know.
Is it possible to order more of those blue rubberised keys?
Yus
dose this keyboard use USB
yes
Is this comes with the retail packing ?
Yes it comes in the retail box.
What kind of keys are on the keyboard? (mechanical, rubber dome...)
Rubber dome/membrane, you'll never find a mechanical keyboard that is under $55-60
Does this game come with any download codes? Or a multiplayer code?
Yes. It comes with both.
This game is multi language?
Yes
Can you play this game on a PS4? I am looking to buy a PS4 for my son but he wants Assassin's Creed 3 and it looks as if its only for PS3. Ty
At the moment, the PlayStation 4 will only play PS4 games. Unless Ubisoft Montreal decides to make a PS4 version of this game, which is unlikely being that they are currently working on the production of newer Assassin's Creed titles, this game will only be playable on the PlayStation 3.
If I buy this, will the case come in a regular clear case or will it be those ugly greatest hits red cases?
The one l bought came in a Clear Case not that Greatest Hits.
Does this game come with the greatest hits box (red) or the normal one?
Mine came in the actual box.
hello can be played on Spanish?
Si, it has subtitles both in English and Spanish
Does it come in spanish too?
NO.
assassins creed 3 trailer had connor riding a horse charging into battle while americans were retreating, is any of that footage in the game itself?
Yes
should i buy this game does it go along with the original story from ac1 ac2 etc will it affect the story line if i skip it and get ac black flag
Hate to break it to you but you won't find ezio or Altair in these games. There stories are done. But I would recommend you do not skip. Get this first than that so you will understand what's going on. However I would get brotherhood and revelations before this one so you know what's going on in 3
This game has subtitles in Spanish?
Unfortunately, it doesn't...just English as default language.
Will this function with an American 3DS XL, or is it only compatible with Japanese 3DSXLs?
This works with all regions of the 3DS XL. In short yes.
does it work for the american 3ds xl
yes it does, check your local gamestop though could they sld carry them now and cheaper.
can i use the Circle Pad Pro as a grip for non supported games
If you try to use it as a grip, you might find it hard to hit the R button because the R button on the Circle Pad Pro is closer to your finger and is essentially useless. You can still reach the R button on the 3ds itself but you have to reach pretty far and might cramp your hand as a result. If you only want a grip, you're probably better off getting something different like a "Skque Controller Hand Grip Handle with Stand for Nintendo 3DS LL, Black" or a something similar.
I have the Newest 3DS XL with the new tiny right joystick that seems useless at its size. Will this device work as a supplement for that?
No it will not as it won't fit properly on the new hardware. That "c stick" nub and the extra shoulder buttons takes the place of the Circle Pad Pro attachment and alleviate the need for it.
what does it do
Some games have the option to have the circle pad, which in most cases, enhances your game play. Best example is Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate which helps with the camera movement.
Does this work with Smash 4 as a c-stick?
Not that I know of. Usually games have an option for the circle pad pro in the control options (MGS 3 did), but Smash did not.
good I want to know because it says console not included in case it is not a nintendo 3ds xl ??
The circle pad pro is compatible with the Nintendo 3DS XL, also known as 3DS LL. 3DS system is not included with the circle pad pro
Has anyone noticed any scratches on the system after using the Circle Pad?I have a Gold 3DS XL &amp; have always used a protector so it's important to me.
I haven't had any problems with scratching from either my circle pad pro or my one for the xl. Sometimes dust and stuff can get into the CPP if not used for a bit but dust it out and you should be fine.
is it a real 3ds
No, this is not a 3DS (and it isn't marketed that way). It's a Nintendo peripheral that adds functionality (extra circle pad and two extra buttons; ZL and ZR) to a 3DS XL.
Will it works on the new 3ds xl?
Frankly no. It adds nothing to it. The new 3ds has the two extra zl and zr buttons, and a c stick. If you want it for the ergonomic feel you can simply get a handle case.
Mouse driven or WASD?
Hey, I am not entirely sure what part of the game you are specifying so I will just try to answer it with the following information: There are 3 different camera angles in this game: there is an over the shoulder third person view; an isometric perspective/ dungeon crawler angle (games like Diablo 3); and then one thats just more of zoomed out 3rd person perspective. If you play with the over the shoulder third person view then you will be moving/strafing your character with WASD and your combat will be based on a combo of the keyboard (inventory/weapon/style selection) and mouse (mouse is used for aiming, and sword fighting because the game uses a mechanic where you click the mouse at specific times for the ideal swing). If you play with the isometric view then you can just use the mouse for movement and combat, with the keyboard being used for inventory, weapon, sword style selection. Hope that helps!
Is this a point and click game or do you have to use the keyboard to perform specific tasks such as walk, jump, fight etc
Both, The game has three modes for movement. Two use the mouse , one uses WSAD and the mouse to look around. Each is basically how you see things(Its all a third person view). You use the keyboard for quick actions or you can click through the HUD. Its a fun game. The Enhanced Edition comes with a lot of extras contained in its files.
Is it Mac compatible?
The disc version may be( or available as a stand alone version). I bought the PC version steam code off of Amazon because they had it on sale. Steam does not have this in a Mac version.
Will this particular Wii play the GameCube games? Does it have the ports to connect GameCube controlers?
I bought this black unit as a replacement for my original wii as I had heard stories of wii ending production. My original console does play the game cube discs and has ports for the game cube controllers. This new unit does not. I haven't tried the cube discs, but doubt they work without controller ports. Hope this helps.
Could someone tell me hat is the difference between wii sport and Wii Sports Resort? Can i buy wireless controller separately to play the cubegame?
Wii Sports consists of five separate sports games-tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Sports Resort consists of the following "resort" style games:Swordplay, Wake-boarding, Frisbee, Archery, Basketball, Table Tennis, Golf, Bowling, Power Cruising, Canoeing, Cycling, and Air Sports(Parachuting and Piloting). GameCube compatibility is limited to the first generation Wiis which include an earlier version of the Sports Resort bundle. Always read descriptions of items and ask sellers questions before purchasing. Hope this helps.
Can Netflix be viewed on this unit?
Yes, once you set up your Wi-Fi and get your Wii online, you can use Netflix or Amazon Instant Video directly from the options menu. Hope that helps.
Does this hook up with the Wii fitness board too
Yes
My friend has a Wii that is 4 or 5 years old. Would her remote and nunchuck work on this system if I bought it? Thanks!!
Yes it does
Can this unit be used with HDMI?
Yes, you would need an HDMI cable to do that.
My father is disabled and bed ridden. Are there many games for this console that can be played in a hospital bed?
Yes. Bowling, table tennis, etc.
We have a Wii that's at least 5 - 6 years old; it has RCA outputs. Does the current model of Wii have HDMI output?
No Wii model has HDMI output. The Wii U, the next generation console that is not a Wii, has HDMI.
Can you do karaoke on it?
Yes there are games you can get that are the same as karaoke.
I need to replace my disc drive but have no clue how to figure out what type it is but it is for this Wii here. Can someone please help? :)
There are several here at Amazon. here is the ASIN# for original Nintendo replacement on Amazon: B00LEEVDXO. Copy and paste number in the search area and it will come up. Hope this helps! ;D
Hello, yes I would like to ask is this a PSP 1000? THANKS !!
No, it's a psp 3000.
If you switch it to English language can you play American game So?
Yes, I can still play english games on this handheld. Only thing i noticed that was different was the controls on the main menu are different ( like to enter the game). Awesome looking system though. Would recommend getting a clear case to protect the system.
Is the game also in English?
No. System and game are Japanese. System can be set to English, game cannot.
hi, is the game also in italian language?
Sorry,this game is Japanese version.
is this the newest one
yes.

Hello, I am using a Mac (which will work with this, I know) but I only have 1 good usb port, which I use for my mouse. Will I still be able to use?
It connects via audio ports, not USB. You should have no problems.
Is this product better or worse then the Ear Force PLA Turtle Beach? What's the difference?
Besides one having red accents and the other blue, the headsets are completely identical. The difference is that the PLa includes additional cords that make it compatible with PS3 and PS4 gaming consoles. The same is true with the XLa, which has green accents and comes with extra cords needed to work with and Xbox 360.
What are the headphone cushion material made of? Some photos make it look like it's made of a cheap foam and the others make it look like fabric.
foam
I have a laptop with one headphone jack, am I able to use this headset for audio and mic through the jack that's used for Phones even though I can't use the PC adapter mic and audio jacks?
I have a headphone which is the same with the picture, Turtle beach ear force Zla game headset. I use this headphone to watch movie on computer that only has one jack. So I think this headset will be work by your demand.
Will this fit my 12 year old son?
yes and they are very nice
Is this compatible for xbox 360?
no, there is a 360 version of this headset though
Will this work with the PS3?
yes, but there's not a lot of games that are compatable with the mouse. Possible soon with the new diablo 3.
can you send to Indonesia?
No, we currently only ship within the continental USA.
Can you send to Spain?
Thanks for asking. We are sorry that we don't do international shipping.
My mouse stopped working and the orange light below the scroll wheel keeps blinking. I did what they told me to do on the site with no results. Help?
If you haven't downloaded the firmware tool I would get that and get the latest firmware installed. I haven't had good luck with the steel series engine software....but you can run the mouse without that. My mouse misbehaves if I use the steelseries engine software.....may be a bug in the program or my system.
Sensei
One of the best mice I have owned only problem I had was the nylon wrap on the cord came pinched as couldn't fix it and it can unfurled and had to cut it off but mouse functionality works super great
Does this product work on World at War?
yes you can i have play with no problems and many other games great mouse.
Is this essentially a second battery that charges the innate battery without plugging into the wall?
Yes
Does this work with the Energizer 3x Charing station?
No, you have to take it off before put in Energizer charging station. The Uboost changes the dimension of the gamepad...
Just making sure here but, I don't think this can be on with a case right?
No a case doesn't fit well with this. I was able to cut my silicone case enough so that it fit.
How long does this last with the extended battery installed?
It gave it another three hours or so.
So when you charge the gamepad this charges with it? You don't need to charge them seperatly right?
yes one charge. my only complaint is after almost a year I need to buy another the battery simply does not hold a charge any longer
how many mha has this nyko battery?
Sorry to this man but it doesn't say. All I can tell you is that this battery is exceptional and can have you playing on your Wii U for over 15 hours if you can work it right. Its a real great find and I highly recommend it. I promise you won't be disappointed.
does it work for call of duty ghosts
YES
please help me i lost the paper with all of the controlls i was hoping someone could post a picture of it
Please send us a message. We can email a PDF copy to you. Thank you.
does it work for black ops 2
yes it does. but remember that this is not a jitter, so it will not make automatics faster, only make them slower. but single shots fire like lightning, on number 4 setting. pop pop pop goes my 57 on hc and does goes the whole team. :D
Do all the modes work for mw3 but just not as well
Yes
An instruction sheet did not come with the controller. Is there a website or link that has full instructions?
That's made by Lighting Modz for the Xbox 360 sold through Amazon. Go back to the AMAZON page you purchased it on. on the right side of the page it will ask for a rating. below the rating area is a contact section to contact the company. when you do make sure your e-mail address is noted. Explain your problem and ask them to email the instruction sheet. when you get the sheet make copies as the paper gets worn. It's a good product for the Xbox 360. They have one for the Xbox one but it's hard to get.
does it work for advanced warafare?
yes I currently use mines with advanced warfare to
Mode 17 is said to be user reprogrammable, bu what does that mean? Can I apply custom macros to a specific button to create my own mods?
No the mode 17 reprogramable is a bunch of different rapid fire options. just remember if you're playing call of duty they set a fire rate so if you set your mod too high it the gun will freeze.
does it work for Advanced Warfare ??
Yes I'm using it as we speak GT: huge camper
Does this controller work with Halo? (Halo Reach?)
It works, but it doesn't do much for Halo. The only difference is that you can hold the tigger for the weapons that you normally need to keep tapping the trigger.
CAN YOU CHANGE MODS
There are 17 modes you can change.
Does the controller work with the rechargable battery packs ? i have a charging station with battery pack and i put my controller on it to charge it
Yes it does
Will this controller Work with Left for dead?
The controller is reprogramable, so it can work with any game you set it to, but yes it has a mode for left for dead
Will this work for TitanFall?
I have not tried every feature of the controller, but the "Rapid Fire" does work with Titanfall.
does it work for black opps 2
Sorry Alexander we returned the controller because it did not do what they advertised. It was basically just like a regular controller. I hope that helps
does this controller use sync to change mode or is there a separate button thanks
It uses the sync button to change mods, to go back you hold right trigger and press sync
Grand theft auto 5 Compatible?
Idk, I dont have GTA 5. Sorry
is it compatible with black ops 2 and how would you program it to the game if it is possible
Don't buy it, controller broke in less then 2 months. Sticks stopped working to move around. Couldn't get my money back.
does it work with bo2
It kind it does work would be old to buy a lags a lot and some of the features really don't work all that well it's kind of expensive control for what it does a good will be done better
Is there a limit on how many people can file their tax using it?
This response is for the actual software shipped to you and NOT the download which *might* work differently. ~~ In previous years, I have used the software to file my own taxes and then passed it to a friend who also used it for her own taxes, including using the efile. (I never registered the product with H&R Block and she even has a different address than me.) I have not finished my taxes for this year yet, but if the previous years are any indication, then it *should* work again the same way. I find no indication that they have limited the e-files so that only ONE user can use them, i.e., nothing on the box or in the material says that.
Does 2012 Deluxe + state work with Windows 8 ?
Yes, it does.
Does this version include any free files? Can that info be added to the description?
Has 5 free Federal, no free State files. Can print and mail as many as you like. Russ O.
can you transfer saved information from turbotax?
Yes, you can. See http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/100753/H-R-Block-At-Home-2012/ (only one of several ads and reviews that specifically state this).
state filing fee
$19.95 for each state e-file. No filing fee if you print it out and mail it.
Can I install on laptop and desk pc
Yes, provided you have the minimum system requirements as listed on the side of the box. Just insert the disk and it should self install from there.
Does it handle Trad IRA to Roth conversion in TY 2012? I know it did for TY 2010. TurboTax 2012 does not handle Roth conversion
Yes, Roth conversions are definitely supported at the form level. I started using Block 2012 as soon as the first download was available. A big reason was to estimate how much to convert this year. I don't recall that Roth conversion was in the original interview, but I'll check. Also, I bet that the forms are available in Turbo Tax too. Update, conversion is there in the interview too.
I have multiple annuities and unemployment income. My self-employed wife files a Schedule C etc. Does this product handle these?
Schedule C, without a doudt. Unemploryment, any income. Annuities, I'm not 100% sure here, but would say 90% sure it will. It does 1099-d, any long or short stocks, so I see no reason annuities would be left out. FYI. All my Scottrade stuff downloaded into 2011.
will H &amp; R Block at home 2012 Deluve + State work on win xp home sp3?
According to the box, yes it will.
How do I know that the Federal fom did get e-mailed? Didn't see anything in my "sent" e-mail box.
First, I received an e-mail from H&Block that said the IRS received my return. A little while later I received this one saying... "Congratulations! The IRS has accepted your federal return."
does it do both chat and game audio on the xbox one when using the adapter
Yea
Are they wireless
No not at all but still awesome
let me get this straight. cause im not 100% sure. i can plug in the included shorter cable for a phone? the hesh 2's are too bulky for school
Yes, there is a cable that plugs into the headset, then plugs into the device that plugs into your pc/console. Or it can be plugged into a phone or mp3 player, etc. Its long but not too long, about the same length as most earbuds.
What Adaptors would I use to connect this to the Xbox One??
Plug the av cables into the TVs audio out and then plug the USB cable into the Xbox .PS its not wireless spend a couple of dollars more and buy the Plyer 2 scucandy
this product works with Xbox ONE???????
Kinda, you need to buy the adaptor from Microsoft. Then buy a cable for the audio input, which is around $5. But you'll experience issues such as adjusting the mic and volume. I personally won't recommend this for the xbox one. Just get the Skullcandy SLYR for xbox one..
do I need an adapter to use these with xbox 360?
No
does it work on xbxo one
No they only work on the 360 xbox . I have both and use both..
Is this compatible with Xbox one?
The Skullcandy SLYR is compatible with the XBox One. It has adapters specifically for it, in fact.
Would you need to have the USB hooked in for them to work on iPads and such?
No.

with the stereo headset adapter with is not included
Is this compatible with the Xbox One?
I have a ps4 not a One so im not sure but i would think yes
can these headphones be used with a PS4?
Yeah, you have to plug the headset to the controller. Just 1 wire that is about 6 feet long.
How do these headphones connect to the Xbox360 controller?
Yes, you plug one part of a mic control into your Xbox and then plug the included 2.5mm cable into your controller.
Can I use this by connecting it directly into my ps4 controller
Yes that's what I do
how long is the wire?
It is pretty long. Around 6 to 8 feet
How long will these headphones be on sale?
Till black Friday
will the headset itself play audio
If you are asking if it is able to be plugged into a phone to listen to music with, the answer is yes.
do you recomend something else
No, its a good set for its price range.
Will this headset's game and chat audio work with both next gen consoles? (Xbox One and PS4)
Yes but you need purchase adapters to make the audio sound better and like with any console boy a sound processor to enhance audio, the processor makes my skullcandy slayers sound smooth and crisp as well as my turtle beach ear force tangos. I would recommend the Dolby dss sound processor from turtle beach

are these compatible with the wii u?
To be honest, I'm not sure how the chat side works for the Wii U, but my assumption is that any headphone with a standard 3.5mm jack will plug in direct to the Wii U controller. You won't get surround sound or anything, but as a stereo headphone, it should work normally.
How's the overhead band size, and the size of the ear cups? Looking for headset that I can wear for hours and for gaming.
The band is pretty comfortable, as well as the ear cups. I wear this for hours, and I have average is not slightly large ears.
is it wireless
Nope!
Are these the best PS4 headsets in the price range?
I have a ps3, but for the price, you really can't beat them. The only problem with the headset is that it occasionally cuts off vocals and you have to disconnect and reconnect the wires. Other than that, the quality of both sound and vocals are very clear. Of mine ever die on me, I will most likely purchase the SLYRs again.
When you "stash" the mic, does it mute? I would like this to act like PTT during games.
Unfortunately no. No way to mute except using the inline control or via console or pc
How do you set this up to work with a PS4? The PS4 has HDMI connection....
it goes into the controller.......
is it a dual headset connecter of single
Wut
will it work with chat on Xbox one
It will work with the Xbox One, but not right out of the box. You will need to buy the Xbox one adapter that will allow you to use it (I think the adapter goes for 25 dollars, I don't really remember what I paid for it.) The adapter allows any stereo headset to work so the SLYR works nice. You don't need to do anything but plug the headset straight into the xbox one adapter for headsets and you'll immediately get game sound to tell you that it is working. No more long cables running between you and the tv/xbox 360. The adapter even allows you to adjust game sound right from it by simply pressing the +/- controls. The other side has controls for game/person volume with a mute in the middle.
will it work with xbox one
Yes I use mine with Xbox one but you need the adapter from xbox
dose this work with xbox 360 with the mic and such with out trouble
Should work fine if you follow the install instructions that come with it

I have a 12 year old that loves trains. Is this game to complicated for a 12 year old? If so can anyone recommend windows 8 compatible please?
I have a 12 year old boy that loves this game. He's been playing is for a few years, upgrading each time he can. Sometimes children don't want to take the time to read the instructions, but they have an amazing way of figuring it out on the fly. That said, there are instructions if a child should get stuck, so don't let them give up too easily. If your child loves trains, has an imagination, and any sort of engineering or problem-solving skills, this is a good learning and fun game/software to buy for them.
Does this software require an internet connection to run (such as requiring STEAM)? Thank you.
Yes!
Is Steam required just to finalize the Install, or does one need to be connected by internet to Steam the entire time while playing Train Simulator?
you do not need to be connected to steam to play after install. just tried it and was able to play. it will come up with a message saying it can not connect to steam and will give you a button to press "play game" click this and it will launch the game. Happy railing! :-)
is this a game on a disk you can put into a dvd rom
Hi, I got mine through steam but here's a link to amazon where you can buy the disk. http://www.amazon.com/Tri-Synergy-12065-Train-Simulator/dp/B009S4JZKK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407301847&sr=8-1&keywords=train+simulator+2013+pc hope link works.
does this game have the amtrak acela ?
I tried unsuccessfully to find the answer for you, even asking a few others. I googled "Train Simulator 2013 - Amtrak Acela" and found several youtube videos that talk about it. Maybe that will help you.
does this program work on windows 8 .1
Yes it can run on Windows 8.1 However it will need to run on the Steam program which is free unless you desire to buy more engines and more tracks.
can you create your own layout? or world? and is their a website for downloading other yards, engines, and or cars? and can you also upload your world so other can play? what you have created?
I believe you can, but not with the basic software. This product is part of Steam, which is an umbrella for this and many other PC games. I think the cost to do what you want is high. Check out Steam on the web, and contact them.
Does this work on Mac?
I enjoy playing the simulator, but there is a lot of problems I have ran into with both 2013 and also 2014 using Windows 8. Some of the games hang up or lock the computer. I also found that some the scenarios were very hard to complete because of time limit set is to short or the trains need more power in order to keep up the speed in the hills, or just shut down. Another thing. It would be great if they produced a manual to show and explain a lot of the operation. For a beginner like myself. Half the time I am lost and have no ideal of what to do next. Very costly to attempt to purchase add-on to enjoy more of the game.
Does this work in Windows 8?
I believe it does. Syetem requirements are on the box. Also the website "steam" has Q
Whats the difference between the expert version and the essential version?
Hi,David. The only difference between both models its that the essential version has no Green LED backlit keys and the Expert version its fully illuminated with the green backlit keys. If you like the design and the Chiclet style keys go for the Expert version.In my opinion this is a very good keyboard. Maybe at the begining it take some days to get used to it but soon or later you wont regret.This is very good keyboard for the price.
Can i change the keyboard color to blue instead of green?
nope its only green
Is the typing silent
Yes
Are the keys noisy
Not at all.
The keyboard is new sealed 100%? is guaranteed everything ok? never bought on amazon ...
Everything OK !
Can you toggle the backlighting? I think it's a feature that could come in handy, but I want to be able to turn it off.
the lighting on the keyboard is fully customisable, going from off to bright and everywhere in between.
Is this a true Chiclet keyboard with scissor or higher grade switches, or just the style with a membrane layer underneath?
I'm not sure,but I'm not having any problems like this other guy. Some places say it has scissor switches, but I haven't taken any keys off to check. It's a good keyboard IMO.
What do the LED lights C, 1 and S represent?
C = Caps Lock 1 = NumLock S = Scroll Lock I own the keyboard and love it! Perfect for me! xD
How big are the keys? The keys on my current keyboard (regular letter keys) are 1/2 an inch across measuring from left to right on the top surface of the key. Does this at least have 1/2 an inch keys?
They keys measure 1/2 inch
Does it still light up without the use of the synapse software?
Yup!
Would this work on my Macintosh?
Its an audio jack input, not USB, so there is no reason why it wouldn't work on a mac. I use my set with both my PC and my iPod when I am at home, and have no issues.
Does it work on the ps4?
The Audio does, the microphone requires a strange workaround for no particular reason. Razer support insists that it's "not compatible with the PS4" despite the product description "The Razer Kraken's 3.5mm combined audio jack is compatible with any device that accepts a 3.5mm input, allowing use across multiple devices.", but they also directed me to this customer-created workaround: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMiHbMWjF2E
does this on xbox one
No I dont it does. I believe its only for computer.
Does this work with Ninetendo 3ds?
The headphones themselves should work perfectly fine with the 3ds. Not too sure if you'll be able to use the mic with them or not but the sound will come through them for sure
I turned down my sensitivity on my computer, but people can still hear the music I'm listening to through my earphones through the mic, what do I do?
the mic on the headset is crazy sensitive no matter what you do, i for one on applications unlike skype that you can use a push to talk key would help...as far as voice activation applications such as skype, their isnt much you can do, lower the music volume separately from the voice application in order to get the right volume...
i gave this to my son for Xmas and one of the sides just stopped working! There are no tears, cuts, etc. in the wires! How do I fix?
It sounds like you will have to go through Razer's warranty. I think they have a 1 year warranty. I would just go through Razer's official website. Unless you get some heavy duty headphones, most will break if not taken care of properly. I hang mine on a hook when I'm not using mine. Or, it could be a wiring issue when the headphones themselves aren't messed up, but maybe the wires did get messed up. To prevent this issue, I keep my wires twisty-tied together so they don't touch the floor. I've gone through extensive research on how to protect headphones because I've had a few that I've gone through and finally found that if you take good care in protecting them & making sure they're taken care of, you can prevent these damaging issues. But yes, try to redeem their warranty through their official Razer website.
Could this be used on Xbox 360? If not, can I buy an adapter?
With an adapter yes but you life would be easier withhttp://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-tiamat-71 or http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-audio/razer-carcharias-for-xbox-pc but there not as good quality wise
Do I need to buy a splitter for pc gaming?
No. It comes with a Aux to Audio/ Mic cable. So you can plug it into a laptop ( Build in AUX cable) and use it or plug it into your desktop ( Splitter, AUX to Audio/mic cable).
Razer Kraken PRO Over Ear PC and Music Headset - Green. with this model can a computer use the microphone if you plug just it into a headphone jack?
You get a splitter for mic and sound
can this be put into an xbox one adapter
Yes you can

Is this a Wii game
The game can be played on the Wii, as well as other gaming consoles. If your going to buy the starter pack, the one with the actual game, be sure you purchase the right one for the Wii. The figures themselves are not exclusive to any gaming console.
Could giants and original characters and swap force work on the trap team portal
I only bought them as a collectors item.
6yr old nephew only wants Skylanders for Xmas. He tells me is Action Figures (Wii). Is Legendary 3 pack a good choice for starters?
Hello. There is no straight forward answer to this question as its a personal choice. Just be sure what skylanders game he has. There are four games now and each game has different characters for it.
I would like to know if you could send to Puerto Rico?
Yes
do the figures work with all skylanders games?
with the exclusion of Spyro's adventure, yes
Not quite sure what I just ordered...I see there are action figures...but is there a wii game too? Why was it over $400 and now only just over $30?
They are 3 legendary skylander figures that can be played with on the actual game. The game is only in the starter packs which is for all systems. I assume it was $400 because of greed & rarity as people on this site occasionally do that. If it's just over $30 then good the price dropped drastically. Smart move on the seller's part.

My grandsons told me that I sent them the wrong giants. They want the ones that are physically larger. How can I tell by the package.
Where the phrase Skylanders giants is on the package. For the "Giant" characters the name "Skylanders Giants" is towards the bottom of the package on the plastic. While on the smaller packages it's on the cardboard backing above the figure.
Can this be used on the wii?
Yes I believe so. I purchased all of the Skylanders Giants only for my son to play on the Wii. Hopes this helps.
can i play this with 3Ds
Yes. You will need to buy the Skylanders Giants or SwapForce starter kit for the 3DS, and you will be able to use all your Giants action figures.
does this work with iOS trap team starter pack?
Yes the main idea to follow is they all are backwards compatible so any giant is compatible and if you want to research this more look at the SCL web page or Facebook page it has all your questions answered there.

Hello everyone! I'm on the fence is this edition region free on Xbox 360?
Well im in Costa rica and the game runs flawless maybe in Asia or..i dont think so actually ... this game was a worldwide hit so it probabbly is region free , this is definitely a great deal
Does this game come with all of the DLC stuff for the first two games?
Bio:plasmids pack,Challenge rooms pack,Bonus museum level Bio2:Sinclair solutions tester,Rapture metro,Kill'em kindly,The protector trials,Minervas den, collectible stickers (3)
Just asking, if the DLC's are on a disc, does this mean that if I get this used I can still get them?
It is a four disc set with Bioshock, and Add-on Discs plus Bioshock 2 and add on discs I bought the game used and the content loaded. As long as it is on a disc my understanding is that you insert the add-on disc and it will download the content onto your save file. The collectible stickers were missing, however. Thank you for your interest. Vernon Ritchie.
Is the game still worth getting?
YES YES YES VERY MUCH
Is this NTSC version of Bioshock Ultimate Rapture playable on a PAL system (Australian xbox 360)?
Yes it is.

To be honest I have beat this game on and honestly this has a lot of new content on the 2nd disk for both games & it's all good entertainment
Is the DLC on a separate disk or download via codes?
The bonus content is on included discs.

my grandson is 5 - can he do this game?
They came out with farming simulator 2015 which is a lot better. I think once he knows the controls he's in good shape. For games like this, you would need a good processor and graphics cards so the game in simple terms is not choppy, blurry etc. Hope this helps,

Some reviews say you need steam installed on computer to play---What is STEAM ?
Yes, you need Steam to install Farming Simulator 2013 whether you download it from the Internet or from a disk. But you don't need Steam to play Farming Simulator 2013. Steam is the name of a website.
Okay so I've downloaded I think 4 mods for fs 2013 but can't find them during game play how do I find them?

Yes, they will all work with swap force.
Does this giant ree works with wii u?
These Skylanders work on ALL gaming systems as long as you have the portal and game for that system. The only thing you have to do with this guy is, "Be afraid of the bark!!" That's his catch phrase. You should see my five year old daughter jump up, pose and yell it with him when he says it. So fun!!
is this the RED Tree Rex? Not The BLUE one.
Yes this is the Red one :)

My children tell me that all of the sky landers will work on the Xbox 360 also.

No this is just the figurine that comes with the game

No. This is answer is coming from my 7 year old son. I cannot confirm it.

Is this figure for the Wii?
No. This is answer is coming from my 7 year old son. I cannot confirm it.
Can this skylander be used with the new skylanders trap team new traptanium portal?
Yes it can
Does this giant work on the wii?
yes
Are the giant figures compatable with the origional adventure packs?
the giants will not work in Spryro's Advanture. If that's what you are asking.
Does he work with swap force?
Yes, they will all work with swap force.
Does this giant ree works with wii u?
These Skylanders work on ALL gaming systems as long as you have the portal and game for that system. The only thing you have to do with this guy is, "Be afraid of the bark!!" That's his catch phrase. You should see my five year old daughter jump up, pose and yell it with him when he says it. So fun!!
is this the RED Tree Rex? Not The BLUE one.
Yes this is the Red one :)
Is this figure for the -box 360?
My children tell me that all of the sky landers will work on the Xbox 360 also.
Is this the large My Giant Tree Rex that sells indivdually at ToysRUs for $49.99?
No this is just the figurine that comes with the game

I am from europe (germany) it is possible to change y to z not only in the layout but also that u can programm it?
Yes, the key caps pop off easily enough, without damage, to swap the Y and the Z for the German QWERTZ layout. The region keyboard settings however are built into Windows itself. For Windows 7 Users - Region and Language - Keyboards and Languages - Change Keyboard - General - Installed Services - Add - German (Germany) - Keyboard - Germany (Check Box) - Click OK twice
Is it a mechanical keyboard?
No, it is the membrane keyboard
Does it have a mic?
No, it does not have a mic, but it has a mic plug-in port, and it has an microphone app on the eye where you can control the volume.
exist Spanish Keyboard Version?
Hello, The language version on this keyboard can be changed to Spanish. However a Spanish version of the keyboard is not available.
My keyboard keeps pressing random keys once in a while (like once every 1-3 minutes) usually shift or ctrl keys. Is it broken? Is there a known fix?
Might want to make sure you have the most up to date drivers, turn off everything and unplug all of the cables on the keyboard and make sure the ports are clean(use some air duster or whatever) . Or could try reinstalling the drivers and software. Hope that helps! If not you might have a faulty one on your hands.. But that would be surprising.
is the key clicky or silent
I Would say a little clicky it's not annoying loud like when you hear it in an office
Does it have anti-ghosting?
Yes
Will this work with an IMAC?
Yes, but considering how much of a pain it was to install the drivers to make the monitor for this device work on my own computer, your better off spending the same amount of money on a better keyboard. It does look great though.
Is this gaming keyboard wirless?
No, and a ton of wires!
Does it work on windows 8.1 because the 7 did not work with 8.1.
I use it with Windows 7 with excellent response. I do not know about Win. 8.
Does this also work for the Dsi XL
Yes, it runs on DS, DSi, DSi XL, 3DS, 3DS XL, and 2DS.
does it work with Dsi ?
It worked with my Dsi Xl.
does the action replay stop working in 3 months???
surprisingly i got mine from a friend who had it for about 6 months and i've had it over a year now and it still works but i have the old ds one
Will this work with the New Nintendo 3DSXL?
Hey, it's should. I never got mine but the game slot is the same size in the 3Ds and XL.
Does this work for downloaded games? I bought my 2ds with pokemon pre installed so i'm curious
As far as I know...unfortunately no, you need the actual game cartridge in order for it to work.
I bought a used 3DS which did not come with any AR cards and the first thing the section would ask for is a "?" card; would this be included?
Lets not confuse AR Cards with this device they are both two different items but to answer your question that has nothing to do with this AR, those cards are not needed on used 3DS units you can go to http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/618/~/how-to-download-replacement-ar-cards-and-booklet to download replacement AR Cards from Nintendo Inc.
I'm looking to pick up a dsi to use with this for pokemon black/white/black 2/ white 2. Would this work with the Ds lite i currently have?
Absolutely does, that's what I have is a ds lite, and it works like a charm :)
does it work with MAc's/OS?
I'm afraid it doesn't. Datel was planning to release a software compatible with MAC but they canceled it for some reason.
Does it have a place for inserting the cartridge or do you insert the action replay then remove the action replay once the codelist is loaded?
All you have to do is place the game inside the action replay and select your codes for the supported game
does the action replay work with the original DS? (not the DS lite)
Yes it works on DS DSi & DS Lite all 3 connect to the internet the same way to use this product but you have to get a hold of the manufacture for the computer App to download
does this keyboard work with windows xp
Yes. Xp and Windows 7 handle it just fine.
How long is the usb cable?
It's 6 feet with a really nice usb, I loved it and you will too :)
I'm an idiot for asking this but, is this wired or wireless? I can't find out if it is or isn't!
It's Wired.
Is this a quiet keyboard or are the keys noisy when you strike them? Thanks.
It's relatively quiet. It's not a mechanical keyboard so it's not that loud. It's average I'd say.
Are there anti-ghosting keys and if so, how many?
As i can see you can press 6 keys at the same time
is this a mechanical keyboard
no
Does the keyboard light turn off when the computer goes to sleep?
No it does not.
Does this keyboard have stands in the back that will arch it up? I can't really type with the keyboard flat. :c
Yes it does. It doesn't tilt up a lot but its better than flat.
Windows 8 capable?
I am using it now. I had to take it from my desktop to my laptop to try it. I am using Windows 8 with the 8.1 upgrade. The keyboard seems to work fine on my laptop. I like the blue-lighted feature. You can dim the lights or make them brighter. I think you would be very happy with it. I hope this answered your questions. Now, I have to go plug it into my other desktop.
how many colors does it has?
The one I received has three colors, blue red, and purple. Changeable by pressing the fn key and the number pad 5.
Does it include the sensor bar?
I bought one for my son in January. Yes, it comes with the sensor bar and blue one wiimote and nunchuck.
warrenty
i think for 1 yr but not sure we have had ours for a couple of yrs and it is just fine.
Which one is better this Wii or WiiU and what is the different? because the price is almost same
The Wii is the console that would be connected to a TV. The WiiU is the handheld device. Similar to the PSP or the NintendoDS.
how much people can play on skylander at the same time

I'm wanting this to replace the one that is going out. Can I use the remotes from my current wii with this one?
Yes
Does this system have wii motion?
yes, this bundle include wii remote plus. so you no need buy extend motion plus device
can you use this system to watch netflix and/or amazon instant videos?...Is there internet accessibility with this particular system?
Yes you can watch netflix and amazon instant video through your wifi internet. There are some other apps such as weather channel and nintendo shop as well. If you are getting this for that it is great but they are discontinuing making regular wii games now which means you will only be able to buy used games or what wii games they have left in store, no up to date games. The Wii U is the new system that also plays wii games and wii u games. The wii U is also expensive. I bought the wii skylanders giant pack for my 5 year old and he loves it, we find regular wii games at yard sales all the time cheap or at gamestop. Maybe when he is older I will buy him a more expensive game system but not while he is so young.
What is included with this. Does it play all WII games just like regular WII?
Yes, this plays all Wii games. It has the console, antenna, controller and nunchuck. This one also includes the skylander's start up figures and the game. The blue color is specific for this skylander bundle.
Does this bundle come with a 110-220v power supply?
yes i think so
Does this system play Game Cube games? Does this system have the Game Cube controller ports on the side?
no it doesnt, to both
Does it include the sensor bar?

are the leds very bright?
Their brightness can be adjusted, so they can be, but if you don't like them to be that harsh, they can be adjusted to be dimmer. Hope this helps!

play puse, stop, FF, FB and volume keys so yes
I just recently received this keyboard. My F5 key is not lit up when I have it fully lit. Do I have a dead led?
yes, return it
CM Storm QuickFire TK or Corsair Vengeance K70
The k70 is a great buy for most all. The build quality of both the TK and the K70 are pretty close but K70 takes the pot. Your options on the k70 are huge brown, blue, and red switches coming in with either black aluminum or silver; n-key roll over easy-Access Dedicated Multimedia Controls etc. The K70 is sleek and professional looking to the point you can take it to work and use it there. Now, the CM Storm QuickFire TK is minimalistic you get what you get and thats it. Not talking down on the product, the product is great. When put side by side with the K70 though, the K70 is the clear choice. For all the options and great features its hard to go wrong with K70. Plus,(depending on what key switch you're getting) you're not spending that much more, but in the end you know where that little extra is going. To answer your Question: K70 is your choice.
Can I use a ps/2 adaptor with the Quickfire TK?
No
How long is the USB cable?
About 5 feet long
Is it possible to replace switches easily on this keyboard? My S key sticks slightly, thinking about switching it with a function key.
A key puller is supplied with the keyboard.
can I program the numpad keys to work as custom macros?
If you have the right software sure.
How does the '00' key work in numpad mode? Is it a distinct key code, or does it just send '0' twice?
The latter, it sends the "0" digit twice. Not sure how useful this is for you but I rarely use it.
Does the cable attach with USB on both ends like on the Quick Fire Pro?
Yes
Are the Home, End, PageUp, PageDown functions accessed by using the shift key or NumLock? Also, I see tat the default function of the "2" is up arrow
The number pad and arrow/home keys are integrated together. You switch between the number keys and arrow keys with the number lock key. So if you want to use the number pad you hit the number lock key which turns off the arrow/home keys and vise-versa. Makes a full size keyboard more of a ten keyless size which I like.
What do you mean by 'Brown Switches?' Is the key light white and the keyboard black? Thanks!
A "brown" switch refers to the style of mechanical switch used for the keys. The color of the lighting and keyboard aren't brown. This site here: http://www.keyboardco.com/blog/index.php/2012/12/an-introduction-to-cherry-mx-mechanical-switches/ offers a pretty decent guide to what different types of mechanical switches are and do. The key lighting is still white, and the keyboard itself is still black.
Will this version of the CM Storm QuickFire TK ever be restocked?
The Brown switched Quickfire TK in the US comes out mid March...I ordered this exact item and they just sent me a blue switched quickfire TK... ugh the frustration.
Hey was just wondering if there was any way to dim the led's on the keys?
There are several levels of brightness. The function keys at the top let you cycle through the different levels.
Hey guys, I have a laptop, does this just plug right in through usb port?
It plugs in via USB, yes.
Will this keyboard work with a Mac?
It should work as a basic keyboard but I don't think the media keys/shortcuts will work
There have been people having problems with which cherry mx switch they ordered. Did the people that ordered brown cherry mx keys receive that?
No problems with mine -yet-!
Can the keycaps on this keyboard be replaced with other keycaps?
Yes, the keycaps can be easily swapped out with the included keycap removal tool--but it's worth noting that you will have a hard time customizing the bottom row. While most mechanical keyboards have R1 modifier keys (bottom row keys CTRL, SUPER, META, and ALT) that are all 1.25 size-or 1.25 times the width of a standard letter key-and a 6.25 spacebar, the CM Storm QuickFire TK has unconventional sizes for most of them: From left to right, the bottom row sizes on the TK are 1.5 / 1 / 1.25 / 6.5 / 1.25 / 1 / 1 / 1.5. The 1.25's can be easily swapped as they're the standard size, and the 1's can be replaced with any custom printed "ZXCV" key. The 1.5's are trickier: A reprinted Tab key would be the correct width, but as it's much higher up on the keyboard (R3) it won't have the same profile as the other (R1) keys to which it's adjacent. The real problem is the 6.5 spacebar, which is practically unheard of. Only one other keyboard has done it (the Corsair K70), so swapping in a custom version may ultimately prove impossible. Of course, this is all only relevant if you plan on customizing the bottom row--there's nothing inherently wrong with the layout, it simply has non-standard keycap sizes.
Hey guys, I have a laptop, does this just plug right in through usb port?
Yes it does, it is a great buy. Hope this helps
Can the LED lights be turned off?
Yes. You can toggle the light settings by using the function key on your keyboard with f4.
Does this game offer stereoscopic 3D like The Show 11' and 12' do?
Yes it does
My enclosed multiplayer code is invalid, and when I contacted Sony they advised the online servers are no longer active. Is this true?
I honestly don't know. Whey I tried getting online it kept saying I needed to pay something and that I couldn't redeem the code, they may have disabled the online server but idk.
We do not have Move for our PS3. Can we play this game with the regular controllers?
Yes
Does the game get hard? I played like 5 games and I won them all easily. Does this change? It'd be great if it does. I want it to feel realistic
The level of play depends on the level you set it and the amount of control you wish take over your player also as you progress through a carrier the game becomes more challenging as you move up
Lenguage options also in spanish?
Yes
Can u play online against other players
Yeah you can play online against/with other players.
is it a fun game for a 9 year old boy
If he likes baseball and baseball video games then he will love MLB The Show. There are ways to make it easier for beginners or younger players to play via in game options.
How do you view your inbox? I see my inbox flashing on the bottom right of the menu and I can't figure out to get there
you need, press the select button and then you can go into inbox, anything you can ask me again. ; )
How do you stop balk pitching? I'm new to this (still learning baseball) and it shows me red and blue boxes at times when I pitch. When I pitch, the umpire makes the runners advance a base. How do I pitch to not make this happen?
It sounds like you should go into "Pitching" settings and check out your options there. You should be able to turn "Balk" off.
Does it show how many pitches the pitcher threw? I want to be able to see how many pitches threw o I can be ready on when to bring in a new pitcher from the bullpen. I want this game to be realistic. MLB 09 Is what I currently play and it's honestly...
Yes. Though I wish there was more detailed scouting reports of pitchers from other organzations in RTTS.

can it fit the xbox one
yes it does
Does the ps4 fit in the case?
It does indeed.
How bad is the viewable angle? Do I have to tilt the screen back &amp; forth to get a clear point of view?
If your play by yourself you fine but if you play with a friend with co op play then it might be to Good with the angle if so I would recommend the 19 inch vanguard.
Are there any issues with taking this as a carry on when flying?
Not at all
work with xbox 360 e console?
yes it would.
can you use wireless remotes and headphones with this?
My son uses his wireless controller on the XBox 360; don't know about other wireless devices.
Has anyone used a xbox slim when in a car? Will the disk get messed up?
Yes, the Xbox wasn't designed with mobility in mind. unless you set up a custom suspension for everything the disk will get scratched hitting a bump on the road this happened to me.
What's the maximum dimensions for the console for it to fit? I want to use the case with an alienware x51, it's only a bit larger than an xbox/ps3, I need to make sure it fits.
The Xbox 360 fits but its tight.
can I plug this into a car with a DC to AC adapter? If so, which adapter would you recommend?
I honestly wouldn't. It would take a lot of the battery from the car. And/or not get enough to run the system properly which I'll cause shortages soon after or start to run hot because it's pushing itself harder. To go on the safe route go to a truck stop and get a car port that is a wall adapter. I would think you would be ok for the simple fact that it's a portable gaming device but at the same time. If I was meant for a car it would of came with a car charger. Good luck
Does the Xbox One fit in this case?
Yes. my son traveled with his system in this case regularly.
This charger is multivoltage 110-240?
Yes it is !
will this charger work with the original Wii Remotes?
It sure will. I have used the following on it: 1. The Wii-U Tablet. 2. Original Launch Wii Remote 3. Wii Remote with built in Motion+ 4. 3rd party Wii remote with built in Motion+ As long as the battery compartment is in the standard location on the back it works fine. You just put in the energizer battery, and it lines up and charges. If you for example had a Motion+ add-on on the controller, you would have to remove it to allow the remote to sit properly in the charging dock though.
Is it okay to have the GamePad powered on while in the dock?
My kids do sometimes, because they have some regular Wii games they play that only use the remotes, and it has been on while they are playing. It doesn't seem to affect it.
My son damaged the original charger cord for the Wii u pad , the one that comes with the system . Will i have to replace it now that Im buying this?
This comes with its own charger cord, so if your original cord is damaged you can use this to replace it. However, it won't plug into the Gamepad directly, it'll only plug in to the cradle. So you still won't be able to play games on the Gamepad while it's plugged in unless you get a replacement from Nintendo.
I bought this last month and it works great. Can I buy additional batteries/battery covers for two more wiimotes?
Honestly i do not know if you can buy extra battery packs for additional wii motes. I would say contact the seller either online or on the phone and ask. Worst thing they can say is no.
if I leave the sleeve on, does the remote plus controller still fit?
No
when the indicators turn green, does the unit stop charging the controllers?
Yes it does
can you charge the Wiimotes with the wrist strap still on the controller?
Indubitably
I am unable to find any replacement batteries for this kit, Does any one know of another battery type/brand that will charge with this charger?
seems unlikely, have you emailed energizer?
Will the game pad fit in the dock station if you have a silicone cover on it and does it charge ok with it on it.
Ya it will sit and charge just fine.. i was the same way thinking it wouldnt and gave it a shot and worked out good and this charges the pad super fast i love it
Is Motion Control required to Play this?
No. Even though it supports it you can play it with just a regular controller.
Does this also have english subtitles like the Japanese version?
Yes it does
is this a physical copy or is a box with the code inside, i hope its physical?
It is a physical copy with a disk coming in it (a code is also included at the back cover of the game cover, although I'm not sure whether it has expired yet).
will it play on sony ps3 north america?
Yes it will.
Konnichiwa!! Is this copy of the game the first print, or is it the re-release version that has 'the BEST' on the box? Could you e-mail me a photo?
Hello konnichiwa! This is first print version! I can not sent picture. Because Stock is located in the Amazon warehouse.
Is this different than the game Okami HD on the Playstation store?
Not really. It's the Chinese version but the Chinese version is completely in English. So basically this is just the disc version of what's on the Playstation store.
Are the menus put in english too, or just subtitles?
I think the menu's are in english as well. I can't read kanji so otherwise I wouldnt have known where to start the game if it was in kanji
Is it the yellow "best" box or the Black label box as pictured?
Yellow best, amigo.
What does it mean by "DLC valid till 2015,march 31"? Does this game have DLC?
it does have DLC but only if you have a Japanese PSN account.
Can I have Japanese audio and English subtitles, like in Ni No Kuni?
I think so. thank you for your question

If the battery pack sticking out on the 360 controller was annoying, is the same with this controller and its battery pack?
the battery pack looks so much like a xbox controler it may even interchange with one. my only problem is the ps3 thinks the batteries are dead at about half way and i get that popup, also the display with the battery level is NOT reliable, that way you have to go till the controler shuts off to get the fullest out of the battery. that being said this is a great controler i dont know why the reviews are so bad.
Anyone else having trouble getting the customizer software to recognize the controller?
Yes I am I haven't been able to fix the problem either
Anyone have any problems with the buttons failing to register? I had a controller where the left click took a 2 second hold to work.
yes it is true there is a lag. now whether it is the lag natural concurring with wireless and the amount of stuff a company has to put into that small space that cutting corners happens, or occurring because of the device mechanics itself i wasted no time in selling my controller. please note i gave a honest and clean review and Datel refused to post it and blankly told me neither to speak of their products. one may suggest honesty is not their policy. you can clean it with 91% or higher rubbing alcohol and a q-tip. or walk away.
Does the USB port also charge the controller so you can play without batteries?
No, the USB port is just to program the controller using a PC.
mac
Works great on mac. However the configuration program doesn't run on Mac, so if you want to change the settings for the mouse you have to do it on a PC. The mouse remembers the settings after you set them, so you only have to do this once.
Does the scroll wheel click into place as you scroll, or does it roll too smoothly?
It does not click, but the wheel has enough resistance that it doesn't move around too wildly.
How does this feel in the hand? Cheap? Sturdy?
it felt a bit cheap when it isn't loaded with weights, but then again i like heavy mice. The plastic i feel should be less glossy and more of a matte finish. The heat from a persons hand tends to make it feel sticky over time and I'm constantly readjusting so there's a bit more glide between mouse movements. The material on top of the mouse would be a better replacement to the plastic right palm side. The mouse wheel feels a bit odd and stiff to scroll, but i believe it'll go away once it's more broken in. The mouse is pretty nice and is wide enough that my hand can comfortably hold it. I still need some further time with it though to see how it is in the long run of gaming. Still it is a pretty nice mouse though for the price.
I have read so many positive reviews about this so I am wondering can this be used also as a regular mouse besides gaming? Thank you very much to all for your answers, Matt Zieminski,Obi Wan,Matt Hines,dsadnick, RodolfoMonteiro, Jeremy anthony and...
Oh yeah. I use it every day at work because I use a lot of shortcut keys and since there are 9 on the mouse that you can make whatever you want, it works great!
Does the scroll wheel have left,right and middle click on the scroll wheel ? I really like this feature
the mouse wheel clicks but only down not left and right.
How long is the cable?
6 feet long.
Does the mouse have a free scroll (logitech G500 calls it hyper scroll) mode on the scroll wheel, a mode where there is no clicking/resistance?
No it does not.
Can you program one of the buttons (side button preferably) to drop the DPI to a specified level only while being held then back to normal on release?
For some reason I got an email of this question, I bought the 4000 dpi version and you can't set it like you asked. I did read the 4000 has less options in the software that comes with it compared to the more expensive higher dpi versions. Probably doesn't help but the best I can do.
Is this a good mouse for your money, or a good mouse overall? They actually mean two different things and the majority of reviews make it even more co
Great overall mouse that easily compares to others 3-4x its price.
I have very large hands, how will this mouse work out with that? I prefer palm grip, and most mice force me to use claw because they are too small.
From my palm to my index finger is about 6 1/2 inches. I can rest my hand on the mouse with the heel of my palm on the table and my index and middle finger rest comfortably on the 2 mouse buttons. This still allows my thumb to manipulate he three buttons at the thumb rest too.
I'm guessing the mouse isn't 8.7 inches long, that's the box. What is the actual size of this mouse?

How well does this work with Nvidia SHIELD tablet? I've heard of stuttering and lag. should I pick up that $13 BT mouse on Amazon instead?
Yes this works with the Shield Tablet. I've used this and 90% of the time it worked flawlessly, occasionally, when connecting a bluetooth keyboard such as the Logitech K810 they would interfere with each other and cause stuttering. Disconnecting and reconnecting the keyboard would usually solve this issue. You can play games and operate the tablet with this though.
Will this work with windows 8.1?
Yes. You will need to update the software but I do not notice a performance or functionality difference. It works very well.
Can you tilt the mouse wheel to the sides as extra buttons? Just like the logitech mice have.
No, you cannot tilt the mouse wheel. There are two buttons on each side of the mouse, as well as mouse wheel click and scroll, and the normal left/right clicks. All are customizable in Synapse.
will this mouse work with a new Mac Power book?
Yes it works great with my current Mac book pro and Mac Pro both new this year.
Anyone know the difference between the 2013 and the standard edition?
Increased DPI, color changed to green, battery life doubled with the use of the newer bluetooth standard.
If I swapped the batteries with Rechargeable Eneloops, would this be able to charge them over the wire like the Logitech MX Performance mouse can?
No, the USB cable is use for data purposes only and is not directly connected to the battery so it can't charge it.
Is this the 2013 version you are selling??
yes, it is 2013 version
I will use this for running Win VMs through OS X (so I use OS X SteerMouse for prefs) Can I adjust the settings with OUT needing Razer's own software?
It won't allow you to adjust the settings unless you have the software installed. The settings are synced from the "cloud", so whenever the computer boots up and it is set to run on startup, it will gather any settings which may have been adjusted on another computer that has the same account on it.
How do I setup the Orochi with an external bluetooth adapter like the CSL USB Nano Bluetooth-Adapter V4.0 ?
Well I'm not sure, I use mine with a MacBook Pro so I have built in Bluetooth. But I would imagine you would open the Bluetooth settings or where ever you can see what is paired and hold down the four edge buttons and wait for it to show up.
will it fit on a wired controller?
Yes it hug the controller just much sure you put it on tight so you don't get air bubbles.( they're super aggravating)
Will it slip off a chrome controller?
No
does it come with the controller
No it is a separate feature you would have to purchase in addition to the controller. It comes in handy for a little while but eventually the material deteriorates after sometime. Still pretty cool item overall
will these work with xbox one controller?
No my friend it wont fit because is not design for Xbox one!
Is it better than a scuf grip because i have a scuf controller with no grip ? Thanks for any help.
Depends on your play style if your like me and you hold your controller tight and your hands sweat causing you to lose. grip. Then yea they're perfect but if u hold you hold your controller lose and you sweat heavy then no because they grip your hand to tight and you do react slower than usual
Does it interfere with the docking station???
I do not have docking station, but could not attach my keypad with it on. Also, within a week the grips on both controllers had started peeling off and would not stick down again.
does this prevent you from sweating
Truthfully yes it does help with sweaty palms. As of right now I'm trying a full run of the entire mass effect series and it has seriously helped me keeping a good grip on the controller. Don't get me wrong, your palms will still get warm. But not to the point of slippage.
Where can I buy a version of this product that works longer than 3 hours and won't ruin my controller?
I've had mine since April of 2013 and it as only just now started to peel the outer textured cover off. The padding is still intact. If I can get the padding off, I 'll buy another set for it.
can you send me instructions on how to program my controller i didnt get nothing with it
Sorry I got it for my grandson. Did you try googleing it. I'm sure you can find it online
I lost my instructions.. Where can I get a digital copy?
I don't believe you can get a digtal one, but if you need one give me your email and I can type one out for you an send I your email.
Can this controller be used online in Warface and does auto aim and auto scope work on line?
It worked great on ghost and mwf 3 just watch some of the program videos that are on YouTube and you be ready to go
does aimbot work online
Aim bot is for Zombies only.
i dont know how to program my controller it never came with instructions
there should have been a white sheet of paper in the box with codes on it
Does it work with turtle beaches?
Yes . I used x12 on mine. And it was excellent. Don't run tactical setup if you want to drop sho . It won't wor . Run default.
So this works for call of duty black ops 2?
No it works for bo2 and bo1 and IG should work for mw2 and mw3. Hope this helps
does anyone have the paper that came with it?
Yes send me number and I'll send u a screen shot of it
Hdmi carries this console?
If your saying if it comes with a HDMI cable, then no. If your saying can you hook one up to the system, then yes.
does this slim design still have wireless internet and bluetooth
Yes, the version I purchased has both( Slim). I had some little difficulty setting up the wireless network( It isn't that hard, I just didn't know what I was doing). I also established a Bluetooth connection with a Bluetooth keyboard( It was relatively easy.)------ FYI, not backwards compatible with Ps2 games :(
Can you still play the games while it is charging and exactly where and how is it charged using usb cable? Do I need a HDMI cord to play the games?
When you say charging, I'm assuming you mean the dualshock 3, and yes you can definitely play and charge it at the same time. Ps3 wireless controllers, whether 3rd party or not, all have a port for the charger. Essentially that cable goes from the USB port of the PS3, to the controller. And lastly, nope, you don't need an HDMI cord to play, you can play with an AV cord, but you won't get good video quality. If you want to buy an HDMI cord for a super cheap price, check around online. I bought mine for 5 dollars.
does your system has every things in the pictures ?
No it did not. It only had one controller and the console box. No games or cords were in the box. I thought they might come in another shipment, but they never did.
This new design still plays Blu Ray movies right?
Yup :)
Could someone tell me if this system is the original sony ps3 and if it comes with full wifi,and netflix capability
This isn't the original Sony PS3 system that was released in 2006. It is second re-designed PS3 model, but it does come with wifi, Netflix capability, and other functions the first re-designed model have.
Does this come with the Sony Manufacturer warranty of 1 Year?
I'm not certain. You should call a support line Sony may have or a customer service number they may have.
What means redesign
Slimmer, Lighter and a Slide To the side of the Slot where the CD Goes.
does this system come with the A/V wires?
Mine did but it might depend on who is selling the system.
What's the RAM?
256 mb system and 256 mb video. It's plenty for the simple task of running one game. I haven't experienced problems with streaming, videos, games or anything else. I hope this answers your query.
Can you just only get the Nintendo Wii White Console bundle?
We sell this bundle with the game. If you want the system only, you would have to ask each seller if that's what they have. However, the price would probably the same or slightly higher as ours.
that model is?
The newer console
can you play wii u games on this???
Sorry, I purchased this for my daughter and not sure what works with it. I hope someone else knows. Sweetpea
Is this version backwards compatible with GameCube games?
I think so you will need a different control for the game cube
Can I play the earlier version wii games on this unit
Yes
Is this unit HDMI compatible?
yes, we use it on our hdmi tv
Is this an updated version of the old WII? We had a WII a few years back.
The only updated item is that you get the newer Wii Remote Plus controllers. These controllers are so much more comfortable to hold when playing games. You get only one Wii Remote Plus & one Nunchuck.
what is the voltage specification? I need the one with 240 volts
110
Are the game cube ports included on this unit? I see them in the pictures, but then at least one reviewer says that they are missing.
There is no game cube ports included on this unit, because this item is the newest version.
The pictures and the details appear to be contradictory. Are any games included in this bundle? ...gamecube controllers? Is it gamecube compatible?
There is no additional game included in this newest version. This WII is not gamecube compatible.
is this download the full game or a free trial
This is the full game, a demo is available at their website WWW. Eurotrucksimulator. Com
does it drive thru Ireland?
Not in the standard game. It does cover pretty much all of the Isle of Britain. Wish it did include Ireland and I really don't know why they left that out since you have the option of taking the chunnel or a ferry ride to the UK to deliver loads from mainland Europe. I know there is one expansion but I think that adds in some cities/countries in eastern Europe. Shame really that Ireland is not in the game. Course, it is possible that game mods may exist that add it.
do u have to buy it and download it at the same time
No, you can buy it here and click download later. Then, you can go to "Your Games and Software Library" and the key should be there. You can redeem that key through Steam.

Is this a mechanical Keyboard? What type?
It is NOT a mechanical keyboard. However, I can tell you that I have been hardcore PC gaming for 18years and I am very satisfied with the way it feels. If you must have mechanical, wait for their new RYOS series keyboards to come out.
This is labeled as a 901 but does not have the US key layout pictured. If I order it will I receive the proper keyboard?
American here. I ordered this keyboard. Here's what mine looks like (pardon the smudges): http://i.imgur.com/Mn6qVwI.jpg
What do you people mean by this keyboard doesnt have a caps lock key? i see this in some of the lower ratings like 4/5 stars.... care to explain?
It has a caps key but I hate it. Its flimsy keys are cheap feeling and the caps lock does not have a gap between it and the letters, making it hard to not accidentally press, which happens alot...which is why im considering a new keyboard to replace due to this horrible design flaw...
Does your keyboard support Arabic ? The keyboard support it but if i buy it from you will I see Arabic letters ?
no
Will this keyboard work on my iMac Late 2012 Model?
Roccat only has Windows drivers and Linux drivers. There are currently no Mac drivers for it. I know that Razer has Mac drivers for many of their keyboards and mice.
Is it possible to change the color of the profile LED indicator, thumbster keys, and LEDs in the upper right hand corner or are they always blue?
Always blue, drives me crazy!

does this work with skylanders?
It works with Skylanders Spyro's Adventure, and Skylanders Swap Force. It also works with Skylanders Giants but be careful because it only works with the Wii Version and not the Wii U Version (if the disc case is Blue it's the wrong version) All of the toys and all of the portals will work. The only thing to be cautious of is to make sure you have the Wii version of the game and not the Wii U version.
Can you play wii fit with this?
Yes, it's functional w/ all existing Wii accessories and software.
can it play gamecube games?
No, wish it did.
what include this wii? include a game?
Mario Kart
Can the wii mini be used with a balance board? Reviews conflict. I just want to get one so I can use a couple of sports/exercise games.
Yes. Use ours all the time.
what is the difference between a wii and a wii mini?
The wii mini has no internet connection, it's just for playing games. It uses the original Wii games, not the new Wii U games.
WIll I need to purchase any additional remotes so that more than one person can play at a time?
The game system comes with one remote, so yes you will need to purchase additional remotes.
will this wii work with my older games?
Yes, regular Wii games will work on this nice console. But Wii U games won't work.
do the regular wii controllers work with the mini?
Yes, you can use use the same controller.
where is the manuel?
There isn't one, at least mine didn't come with one either. Sadly, those days of the good ol' 30 page NES manuals are long gone.
im just curious when playing any game online like dark souls or any other online game how much is that xbox live a month?
idon't play online to many smucks..but it's 60.00 a year for online for xbox...you can also get 3 months or 6 i beleive
So are there small villages, towns or cities in this game that you can trade, buy potions, etc.? Ex: Oblivion, Skyrim
There is a main hub that people you meet along your journey will also travel to and you can fast travel there from any bonfire you have lit to trade or level up.
Do I have to have X Box live for this game?
No
is it region free or locked on NTSC?
You can decide to have it region lock or worldwide in the in-game settings.
Will this play on the Xbox One?
I would say no because the Xbox One is not backwards compatible.
Can you play as a female character?
Yes. You pick gender, hair, features and build.
The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?
Yes.It does.
do you have to be on xbox live in order to play these dark souls games online?
Yes. It will require an Xbox live gold subscription.
Why does it have a Teen rating vs. Mature?
Well, there really isn't much mature content in the game at all. Very minor coarse language, no smoking/drinking, no sexual themes. There's violence, sure, but no excessive gore or blood.
If I've never played a Fire Emblem game, will I still understand/enjoy this game?
Yes, absolutely. Play it on the easiest difficulty your first time through as you learn the mechanics (normal, classic) and dont be afraid to look up any questions online. I had never played an FE game before and I loved it.
I've heard that in the Fire Emblem series, there is something called PermaDeath. Is that Permanent Death? If it is, can it be turned off?
Yes, it's called Casual Mode, and you can choose whether to play through the game with it or not.
What's so special about Fire Emblem Awakening compared to it's predecessors?
There's a couple things that I feel really help it stand out. For starters there's the relationship system that's in place - which not only gives better bonuses when people with higher relationships are next to one another, but it also unlocks conversations between party members that can be insightful, and entertaining. (I love character development, personally). Relationships that reach an S status can also result in 2nd and 3rd generations entering into the game. Don't fret! this is handled well, and plays in line with some of the other options of the game. It's not as forced as it may sound on the surface. Secondly are the reeking boxes and maps you can download. The boxes are ingame items purchased with ingame currency and let you create random battles to help level up your army and build relationships. These things are invaluable. The maps you can purchase are a lot of fun, and often give you boosts in income or experience, but they don't impact the game itself - you're not missing out on important game stuff if you skip buying these. Lastly, the option of playing casual or old school is nice. Casual removes the finality of death, and it's a great option when you just feel like relaxing and enjoying the story. Old School is great because it's nice to be able to play the game as intended. You can play either of these options on easy or hard settings on top of it all. There's a little more to it than that, but those are the things that I feel stand apart from previous versions. I've gotten pretty deep into the game, and I really can't find anything to complain about so far. I'm enjoying building relationships, and the story is interesting, and the game play smooth. If you've enjoyed past Fire Emblems, chances are high you'll enjoy this one.
Which 3DS region lock does this game have? Does it depend on where it's ordered from?
I would say it's US locked. I live in the US and it works fine on my system.
I understand the 3ds is region locked, does that mean only US-bought 3ds will be able to play this even if you have the physical copy?
Correct U.S game requires a U.S game boy
Once you beat the game/story, can you replay the game at a higher difficulty with your progressed and high level characters?
you can only transfer your "avatar" character to use on other files, but you need to "recruit" him by paying a considerable ammount of gold. Besides that, no, you need to start every difficulty from scratch. thats part of the experience though if you ask me.
IS this appropriate for a 8-9 year old?
I would not recommend it. It is quite violent and can be sexually suggestive at times. You could look into another series i play which is Rune Factory.
does a poster come with the game i see it in the images lol
When I got it, there was no poster. There was only the game box with instructions and the game itself.
Mexican console works?
No. It is region locked to NA Nintendo is well know for this.
My son purchased 3ds in usa but found that the 3ds games purchased here in Australia are not compatible . What 3ds does this game work on?
This game is for the US version of the 3DS
So does this controller register as a Pro Controller or Classic Controller? Is it wireless?
It registers as a pro controller,and yes it is wireless.
Hey guys I'm having trouble with this controller in Wii Mode. Able to sync but the battery is always 0% in Wii Mode after charging. Can anyone help?
Kristin nailed it. Its for the Wii U only. It won't act like a classic controller
How does this compare to the nintendo one?
The right thumbstick is offset like the Xbox Controller, which makes it a more comfortable controller IMO. It's also cheaper. However, I've had 3 of these and the left thumbstick lost tension on all of them after 3 months of moderate use. You can find the Japanese import of the official Wii U controller for $39 on here. I would suggest buying the more reliable controller.
How is the analog stick sensitivity on this? Does it have any dead zones? Do the buttons feel soft or clicky?
The buttons are pretty clicky but the analog sticks do have some dead zone. It's not so much that it gets really annoying but just enough to notice.
About how long is the battery life (those of you who got actually functioning units)? Does it compare to the WiiU Pro's 50+ hours?
For me is very long lasting work more time versus wii u remote
Does this controller work on all Wii U &amp; Wii games? Does it do the job for Mario Kart? Mario Bros.? or Donkey kong? etc.
It does not. Any game that requires the use of the gamepad will not work with the Pro Commander alone. But that often means you have to just use the Wii U Gamepad to power a game on, and then you can use the Pro Commander. Speaking from personal experience, Mario Kart works great with just the PC, but New Super Mario Bros needs a Gamepad to boot.
How would this work for Smash?
It's supposed to be awesome for Smash. That is the reason my son asked for this controller. 1st Item I purchase did not keep a charge. So I had to send it back. I reordered a new one.
Will this controller work with the new Super Smash Bros. Wii U game? Does it register as a pro controller?
Yes, it is actually really good for super smash.
Controller only works when plugged in. Is there a color that indicates when the thing is fully charged? Or did I just receive a bad unit?
A red light appears when it's charging.when it's done it goes away.Your controller should be able to work wireless if it doesn't then it's defective.
Does anyone know how well this holds up in games like Super Smash bros? The responsiveness and durability for example.
I doubt it the buttons on it are pretty crappy. You have to push them very hard to get them to register. Didn't play smash with it but it was pretty bad for mario kart.
Does the disc version still require steam to play?
Yes, you'll have to create an account, or use a previous one. If you dint have stream downloaded, during installation of shogun 2 out will ask you to download it for you. Hope this helps.
when recruiting units is it like Rome 1 that is 1 unit per turn or can it be multiple?
It can be 1 per turn depending on how upgraded the castle and province is. Generally ashigaru (commoners with weapons) units are recruited quickly. (1 turn = 1 season) More skilled units (Samurai, Kisho Ninja, Warrior Monks) will take longer 2-4 turns.
good for windows 8?
I have windows 8 and it runs perfectly for me.
Does this come with an install disk? Yes I have a steam account but cannot buy content for some reason.
It came with multiple install disks. One for Shogun 2, and another for the expansion sets.
Do I need to be connected to the Internet like in Empite or can I play offline?
You can play offline to with ou no problem, online online if you want to play multiplayer
Does the gold edition come with the Clan packs and other DLCs or do I have to buy those separately?
idk but i comes with rise and fall of the samurais and that is it
is it have chinese language?
I look into the resources of the disc and just bring manuals in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian. Sorry but I dont see any chinesse, but you know what maybe when you installed trough steam they give you another lenguage option because that game is WOW
Does it contain the original game? I accidentally buy the part 2 but it does not contain the original game. I can't play it now.
Yeah the one I got came with original case and game with everything in it like instructions and the product key.
why not a windows 8
it works on windows 8 tried it myself
Does this have any copy protection software?
You can install from disk and then activat through Steam or I just pulled the codes out of the box and loaded the latest version from steam. Either way the discs are basically placeholders
The firmware update page says that the PLYR2 allow for 7.1 surround sound on PS4. Is this true, or just a copy-paste of the PLYR1 info?
Just cut and paste. It has no capabilities to do surround sound. All it has is a analog left and right RCA input jacks. Go to Skullcandy's website and check the spec.'s out yourself.
what is the battery life for this product?
I would say I get a good 10-15 hours of runtime on a single charge, and standby time is also pretty good, charges up pretty fast also!
So can you use these with an Aux. cord with you Ipad/Phone?
Yes, if you use the Auxiliary cable port on the wireless base.
My head-phones don't seem to work with I-tunes. They work with Pandora and other cites. Does anyone know how to fix this?
Buy a Droid
are these headsets good for FPS games like Call of Duty and Battlefield
Yeah mate they are called, my little brother and I play call of duty online, they are light and good quality sound for the price, it's worth the money, I use them on PC
compatible with ps4?
No problem, just make sure the power is connected to a wall outlet, not into the USB on a the PS4.
Can I use these on a plane to listen to my iPad music or the free TV they have on the plane?
In fact, no. They require a transmitter to your computer or pod with USB power from a wall socket to it. The headphones are great at home only, or with power and a laptop on a Wifi hotspot.
Will this work on mobile phone?
Yes you need a aux cord to plug in the head phone jack and the receiver needs be plug in in with USB power
Can you use mic and audio on the PC with a 3.5mm AUX cable?
Yes
Will this work on the Xbox one using the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter and a 3.5mm or 2.5mm Jack?
This headset should work for the Xbox One. I have the white version and as far as I know there are no differences. So long as you bought a new Stereo Headset Adapter and this headset was new you won't need to buy any new cables. The Adapter comes with a 3.5mm to 2.5 mm adapter and the headset comes with a 2.5mm cable. Just make sure your controller is updated (instructions come with the adapter).
The firmware update page says that the PLYR2 allow for 7.1 surround sound on PS4. Is this true, or just a copy-paste of the PLYR1 info?
Just cut and paste. It has no capabilities to do surround sound. All it has is a analog left and right RCA input jacks. Go to Skullcandy's website and check the spec.'s out yourself.
what is the battery life for this product?
I would say I get a good 10-15 hours of runtime on a single charge, and standby time is also pretty good, charges up pretty fast also!
So can you use these with an Aux. cord with you Ipad/Phone?
Yes, if you use the Auxiliary cable port on the wireless base.
My head-phones don't seem to work with I-tunes. They work with Pandora and other cites. Does anyone know how to fix this?
Buy a Droid
are these headsets good for FPS games like Call of Duty and Battlefield
Yeah mate they are called, my little brother and I play call of duty online, they are light and good quality sound for the price, it's worth the money, I use them on PC
compatible with ps4?
No problem, just make sure the power is connected to a wall outlet, not into the USB on a the PS4.

Why don't you make a 2014 one at least make a 2015 one
We do not MAKE the games, just sell them. Do you have a question about this version?
So....MLB2k13 is the last in the series? No version for 2014 for xbox 360? Do they at least update rosters for 2013?
no, they pulled the plug on everything.
WILL MLB 2K 12 MLB2K13 WORK ON X BOX 0NE
I don't think so.
Why does the game not allow you to have full control of fielding?
Go to ur settings it should let u cuz I have full control is it not letting u run to catch the ball ? Are throw?
We live in the UK and have bought our x-box here, but this game isn't available in the UK. Will it work on our UK X-box?
As far as I know, only a few specific games on xbox are region free. If you bought your xbox in uk, this might not work. Ps3 is region free, which Mr Delahunty may be thinking of. Good luck.

how long is the mouse cord?
1.8 metre or 6 feet.
Is it compatible with windows 8?
Yes I use it with 8.1 with no problems.
Does the scroll wheel scroll left &amp; right?
Unfortunately, it doesn't. It can only be scrolled up or down, just like other typical mouse.
Which is better M60 or M65? I heard some complaints about M65 acceleration,iso I want to know which one you recommend, especially for gaming?
First off, the two mice are physically similar; except for maybe less than an ounce of weight difference. The button placement is identical, as well as the ergonomics. Aside from the M65's better DPI, I don't see any differences in specs (at least on paper). I haven't felt any acceleration or "floaty" quality with this mouse, though I don't play roles that require absolute pixel-accuracy. This mouse has been great for my lazy grip, which is a half way point between palming and griping the mouse. While it may sound odd, I have another mouse plugged -- a Logitech G502. That is perfect for a claw grip and works best for me when I want to change up how I play. --- ADDITION --- After doing a bit of reading, I found out both the m60 and m65 have 3-5% positive acceleration (and can't be turned off). I suppose I've adapted to it though since it's a common thing in most mice I own, apparently.
How much does the mouse weight without the extra weights? And how much does each individual weight weights? In grams please.
Without weights the mouse weights - 117.9 grams Weight of one weight - 4.1 grams Weight of the mouse with all 3 weights in - 130.1 grams Hope that is what you needed :)
How accurate is the scroll wheel? For ex. I play Garrys Mod and use scroll wheel to jump, is it accurate for jumping and doesnt glitch?
If by accurate you mean "responds to being clicked", I've never had problems. I click, and the action happens. It takes a little bit more force to click than many other mice, though, so it may get annoying if you need the wheel to be easy to press. As for scrolling, there's a tactile little "tick" while scrolling. I.E. it feels bumpy when scrolling, much like many other mice.
What are the dimensions of this mouse? In the product description the dimensions listed make this mouse bigger than my keyboard.
4 1/2 x 3 x 1 1/4 lxwxh roughly measured
is there a wireless version to this?
No, with USB cable. tks.
i have a large hand and palm grip is this mouse big enough?? to do that iam useing a logitech g100s right now
The measurement for this one is:11.8(L)~7.2iWj~3.9iHjcm, for your reference, the Logitech g100s measurement is 11.6~6.0~3.6cm, so I think it is big enough for you. Thank you and best regards, Lenka
is this mouse for right or left hand??
Right. The sniper button is for the thumb.
will this play on win8
Yes, 8.1 I'm unsure of but i run it on 8.
Is this the complete version (just like the one on Steam) that has all DLC? I'm pretty sure the DLC isn't even sold separately anymore for downloads.
Yes the DLC are free this is the last Cod that have new maps with the patchs.
does it work on windows 7?
Yes it does work. If it is extremely laggy(which it shouldn't be) then you have to enable compatibility but you should be good.
does the PC download work on mac
As far as I know it does not
if I buy the PC Download, (I just want to make sure so I get my money's worth), I can download this on steam, im still a bit confused
No, this will not work with steam.
So if I buy this, I can put this code into steam, correct? and then it will be in my games library?
Nope.
Does this have the nazi zombies on it?
Yes...
dose ithave zombies
Zombies is part of the free downloadable patch
Do you know if it is the 1.7 patch?
It is automatically updated. Since it uses Steam.
Will this game work on Win 8.1 64-bit
Trying any game in 8.1 is a toss-up. You can check other sources, but the stability and consistency of 8.1 affects all things. I've heard of some games working on some 8.1 pcs, and then failing on other 8.1 pcs. But you do know that it will always work on win7 :)

Can this be bought/installed/played on a UK Steam account, want to know before purchace?
My guess is Steam is just Steam with no national connection. If you are already downloading from Steam then it should work.
Can you play multiplayer or is there no players online?
Yes, there are a lot of servers still up. Just check you're running the latest patch (1.7). This is most likely why you're not seeing any servers.
does this work on windows 8
Yes it works i am playing it on windows 8
can i buy and download this if i live in Australia??
Worked fine for me in New Zealand
Do you need steam to download this game?
Yes it is a Steam key that you are given.
can you play multiplayer or online?
Yes. Generally both are the same thing
Do you redeem this on Steam?
Well that's the way I did it. On the main steam window, at the bottom left corner, there should be some text that says "add a game". Click on that, and then click on "activate a product on Steam". You should redeem your code there.
Will this game play with the Windows Xbox Wireless controller?
No
do you have to have internet access to play the game once downloaded?
No, you do not need Internet unless you're playing multiplayer.
I downloaded the game COD 4 MW but steam isnt working and i cant get to my game!!!!
You don't have to download this game from Amazon. Download steam from steampowered.com and open your games library then click the "Games" menu then click "Activate a Product on Steam". Follow the wizard to add your product key which you would have received in email from Amazon and the game will work.

What color are the light on top? It looks different in every picture.
It's not a solid color. It cycles through multiple colors
Is this mouse compatible with mac?
It's USB mouse.. So unless your Mac has no USB ports, yes.
Mouse Freezes
Yes the mouse does freeze I bought two of them and both of them freeze. I online game and it is a huge problem. I must return both of the products.
what the design on it called?
The design looks a lot like the contact patterns of a circuit board. The light will change through a sequence of colors. The best part is the fact there is a switch to turn off the light on the bottom of the mouse.
Does it bring an installation cd? I bought one but the box was lost the mouse freeze and I am not able to select dpi options. Thks in advance
No I doesn't. And that is how it is with alot of people who bought this mouse, including me. It freezes because it's cheap. It's a horrible mouse, if anything try and return it.
does it work for minecraft
It works well with any game, really.
can different keystrokes be assigned to the programmable buttons for different programs? How many?
Yes they can. Currently only the amount of buttons can be keybound, without adding shift or cntl. But the amount is almost endless. I have all button bound, and again with holdin shift, and again for holdin cntl just for wow. It's very customizable.
Just ararived and does not work at all. tried several computers, not a problem on my end, the mouse is dead. unless there is some secret magic dance..
mine worked fine had no problems with it
Does this product have a warranty
3 years manufacturer warranty

Once Ticket to Ride has been downloaded, will I be able to play without an internet connection?
Yes. You can play the game with the computer. Obviously, you'd need to have internet in order to play with other (real) people around the world, though.
Will this version play network games with the android version?
I do not think so.
Can two people play a game against each other on the same computer?
Yes, you can. Play modes are: Solo, Online Multiplayer and Play & Pass. All of them with 5 players max. Good game, I recomend it.

Receiving "7-Zip Error" No Archive Found during installation process. Unable to install the program. Solutions?
I would download a copy of Winrar: http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm Use Winrar to extract the zip package to your desktop, and install that way.
Can I add the key to Steam?
I'm honestly not sure as I've never purchased any of my game expansions for FFXI through Steam. However after some searching about I found this website which I believe answers your question: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2292-OAKZ-7524 Just a bit down the page it states: " Note: Retail CD-Keys for this game cannot be registered through Steam. If you wish to create a shortcut to this game under your Library, instructions can be found here: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2219-YDJV-5557" So while it doesn't appear you can add it directly to your library, it seems there may be a way to link a shortcut for yourself in steam to reach the game. I hope that answers your question, and if not then at the very least you've got somewhere you can start to dig a little deeper! :) I wish you the best of luck.
Is this supported by windows 8.1?
Yes it is. You WILL have to make sure to allow it to install directX 9 and whatever else it wants during install. If you do not, it will cause problems as windows 8/8.1 do not have native DX9 support.
I already have the game and part of the expansions on my computer, if I bought this just for the extra expansions, will it install on top ok?
You can select what you want to have installed and once you add your new activation code your account will know you have the ultimate collection for Seekers of Adoulin - no problems.
Are all expansions in this download?
Yes
Is this game downloadable content or would I actually be buying disks to download.
Downloadable. But I wouldn't recommend it. I wasn't able to even get to the character screen.
does it come with register code and buddy key? if so il buy
I don't believe there's a buddy key, it only have me registration key for the entire connection (one key for all) a key to unlock chocobo hat, and another to unlock chocobo shirt. Those two items alone are worth your friend buying the game himself, however. Hat gives auto reraise/regen/refresh to level 31, shirt gives +50 acc/racc/magic accuracy to 31.
Will this run on Windows 8.1?
Yes it will.
Just wondering, does this collection has separate registration codes for the different expansions or just one for the whole package?
Just one for the whole package
When I install it on my bootcamp for windowns 7 It starts to install then nothing happens. I know my computer can run this game. Help Needed!!!
There's a POL viewer bug with windows 7 and beyond. The architecture of windows changed after XP. Your computer can run it! You just have to download the new POL viewer client from: http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/download/media/vista01.html?pageID=media Hope this helps! Happy gaming!

good afternoon, i wanted to know if these games are pal system pal, thanks
If u are wondering if the characters can be used with any system, yes. My children can bring there characters to their cousins house and play them on the playstation 3 even though we have the xbox 360. The game itself doesn't work on other systems but the characters and the power ups can.
multiplayers
The game is fully 2 player local coop, and Toy box mode is 4 player online
Is this version also compatible with XBOX ONE? Thanks.
Not unless it says xbox one. Xbox 360 games can not be played on xbox one.
Will the figures and the stories work with 2.0 since this is 1.0 stuff?
The figures that are 1.0 will only work in the toy box mode for the 2.0
Can 2.0 pieces be played on this version or can this version pieces be played on the 2.0 game?
Unfortunately 2.0 gamepieces and figures do not work in toybox or playset mode of the original game, however figures, pieces, and power discs from the original game are compatible with the 2.0 edition with the exception of playsets, note however that figures and discs themed to these playsets can be used.
Do you need to have Kinect to play this?
Nope, you do not need Kinect, actually, the game does not utilize the Kinect at all, as far as I am concerned. No need for the Kinect!
My daughter is 6 and likes playing Infinity on the iPad. Is she too young to play this on the Xbox 360?
Not at all
Which system is the best to play infinity on ?
We use it with Xbox 360 and it's great!
what is the difference between xbox 360 and xbox one infinity starter packs
Xbox360 and Xbox one are different gaming systems so the software to run it would be different.
If I buy the Lone Ranger figures, can I play the lone ranger story with this Starter Pack? If not, what else I need to buy?
If you want to play the lone ranger story you need to buy the lone ranger play set. It will have 2 figures and an extra piece that is clear. That piece is what you need for the lone ranger story. You can buy the figures by themselves and use them in the toy box but you will not be able to play the story that way.

Is this the 1.0 starter pack?
Yes,1.0
can this be played on the T.V or do you need a special box?
all you need to have is a Playstation 3 hooked up to your TV via HDMI cable or audio video cable then connect the power base to your Playstation and put the action figures on the power base the cd dis goes into the PlayStation 3 and you're set.
Does this included a system as well
It includes the system for Disney infinity, you will need the appropriate gaming system. We have a PS3.
can you play with characters 2.0?
No. 2.0 characters are incompatible with 1.0 game.
Do you have to be online to play this game? I don't have internet connection for my PS3, and I want to make sure I don't need it before I buy this.
You don't have to be connected to the Internet at all! My son has been playing this game for over a year and loves it!
Can I use the figures from marvel super heroes on this base
I have not tested it, but I see no reason why you shouldn't.
can the infinity game be played on the psp 3000 portable gaming console?
No
exist spanish languages?
Yes
Do kids have to know how to read to play this game or is the text said aloud? My 5-year-old wants this badly.
Reading is helpful, however, it is functional without being able to read. I have a 3 year old that LOVES to play and is pretty good at it (to an extent). There is plenty of direction read aloud.
Hi, i'd like to know if with this starter can i play with marvel characters.
This is the original starter and can only play with the 1.0 version characters. All the marvel character must be played on the 2.0 version software. Sorry, no marvel characters for this starter.
Is this the 1.0 starter pack?
Yes,1.0
can this be played on the T.V or do you need a special box?
all you need to have is a Playstation 3 hooked up to your TV via HDMI cable or audio video cable then connect the power base to your Playstation and put the action figures on the power base the cd dis goes into the PlayStation 3 and you're set.
Does this included a system as well
It includes the system for Disney infinity, you will need the appropriate gaming system. We have a PS3.
can you play with characters 2.0?
No. 2.0 characters are incompatible with 1.0 game.

What differences are there between the Wii version and other consoles? Is the Wii version "stripped back"?
you get the same things... just they hook up to the console so you need the right one to hook up to the machine. the infinity needs a controller and a nun chuck.... I don't know what you need for other consoles.
Do all of the characters that you buy seperately work on ALL of the hardware, or are the characters Wii/Xbox etc specific?
The characters and power up disk work for all different hardware. So if you have a Wii U and get an XBOX and buy the play disk, the characters you have will work for the xbox.
My grandkids have a WII it is not a WII U. This starter pack will work on it? and then which characters will work?
We also only have the Wii not the Wii U and the Disney Infinity Starter Pack did work and all the characters were fine. My son finished the game so I haven't bought any in a long time. You should confirm at the store when you purchase but we didn't have a problem.
Do the newer figures (Baymax, Hero, etc.) work on the 1.0? My kids do not know who the Marvel characters are, but want the new figures.
They do not work on the original Wii. My understanding it that it works on all the others Xbox 360. Play Station and W U.
What is the difference between the starter pack for the wii and the infinity 2.0 ? Which would I want to buy - my granddaughter has a wii
I believe that the infinity 2.0 will not work on the Wii. I think you have to have at least the step up on the W to use 2. We ended up buying an Xbox for my 3 grandchildren so they could use the 2.0 - which is the Super Heroes. I still have a Wii and plan to have the old one at my house so they can play with the older one when at my house.
Will Disney Infinity 2.0 figures &amp; power packs work with this version of Disney Infinity or do you need to find 1.0 figures?
The 2.0 will not work with this pack, the 1.0.
We purchased the Infinity Starter pack I have characters that say 2.0 does this mean they will not work?
2.0 characters can only be played on the 2.0 starter pack platform. your better off buying the 2.0 starter pack for this reason or waiting for the new 3.0 starter pack to come out because you wont be able to play the new 3.0 characters on the 2.0 platform. the new 3.0 characters are supposed to be star wars fyi
So is the toy box in the starter set for a wii I got for my grandson and now want to add frozen girls to same system will it work
I don't know. You need to make sure it is compatible with wii. If it is wii u it won't work I don't think.
Do you have to have internet to use this system?
No
can any character work on the starter pack?
If your starter pack is one of the 2.0 versions. if not, then only those characters that are NOT 2.0 will work.

My broke ac remote have this code 6711A90032U, the one you sell will work??
It was replacement for a broken remote for LG air conditioner got it and works the same as the one that broke. So if LG then it should work!
My LG remote No. 6711A20111H has broken and I need a replacement. any ideas?
The one we bought here on Amazon works great. This looks like the same one...no problems so far.
I have a LW1011ER (10,000 BTU) and I'm unsure if this remote is compatible. Can anyone confirm?
yes it will thanks EF and Dime
will this work on a sharp confort touch window a/c
No, only on LG brand
Will this remote work with a LG Window Air Conditioner Model LW1210HR? It looks the same as the original except for missing the Energy Saver button
Yes it definitely will work
lg 103taul00734 heat &amp; air conditioner
sorry it doesn't
work with LG Model 6711A20111L?
I am not sure on that one.
I lost my remote and my LG unit is 9000 BTU'a model number LP0910WNRY2 ...will this one work for that?
by doing a search on the AC unit you will get the serial number of the remote. I would not trust any one person to know which remote works with which AC unit. Then when you get that serial number you can then go to a replacement guide that would recommend which remote to purchase. Do your own research and be successful Cheers!
Will this remote work with the LG LW1012ER model?
it's good.
will it work on a x41
Yes, it will work with an X41.
Will it work for X42's?
It should work as far as I know.
Can I plug one end of this directly into my px4 headset and the other into my controller and have the chat volume and mic mute function properly?
Yes
Will this work with Astro A40s?
i believe it should but you still should check w/mfg
Will this work on Turtle Beach Ear Force M5 Silver Mobile Gaming Headset?
The M5 model is designed for mobile devices and is not compatible with the Xbox 360 console.
Will it work for the phantom model?
Yes, this type of cable can be used for Xbox 360 chat with the Phantom headset.
Does it work with the turtle beach X32s?
it should but I am not 100% sure
will it work with the px5
Yes, the Xbox 360 Talkback Cable will work with the PX5 headset.
Will it work on tritton ax 180?
i don't think so judging by the pictures on the triton website the cable looks like it is permanently fixed into the headset itself, if your having issues i'd say your best bet is to take them back to the store and exchange them. or check out the website http://www.trittonaudio.com/prod/parts.asp
Are the end connectors 2.5 mm or 3.5 mm? My son's X31 uses 2.5 mm and a white talkback cable. Newer X31 models appear to be 3.5mm.
Its 2.5mm. The same size as the xbox controller jack for both ends
is this for titanfall
This item is for any Xbox 360 game that needs to be saved. So yes Titanfall and any other game. Works great and I haven't had any issues with it to date :)
Does it comes in Retail Box or bulk ?
It comes in a white box inside of the box shipped. It is not a x box product but is made to be used in it. Works great. I am very satisfied with this product.
Can you use this for Destiny?
Yes absolutely
Are you able to play original Xbox games on this hard drive?
I haven't tried it
Do I just plug it into the Xbox or do I have to buy a cable to connect it?
It goes right in
My Xbox 360 4GB will not recognize it. What do I do??
You need to return it. It's not a Microsoft HDD and sometimes the xbox wont reconize non-Microsoft branded products. Return and have them send you a replacement
This hardrive can be used on the xbox 360 slim console in black.
Yes, it can be used on the xbox 360 slim console in black.
Hello, send it to chile?
It is possible but there are extra charges involved for long distance courier.
Can you tell me your actual experience about this HDD, ? How many time do you have one ? And, still working ?
It Works perfect. Thanks! but. I got the HDD about a month.
Dead zones? Does it have dead zone areas for the joysticks?
No, works great! The only thing we don't like about it is, it doesn't turn the playstation on like the other controllers do.
does it work with windows 8.1?
Yes
can i use this on pc
Yes you can just put the Dongle in the USB port
does the home button work on this contoller with the PS3? i know it wont turn it on and off but can i still go through the PS menu??
It actually doesn't turn it on but all the other functions work for it
How big is the USB dongle?
About 1 3/16 L x 11/16 W by 3/8 high
how does it connect in the bluetooth setting or do i just plug it in with the usb wire and it automatically syncs?
Just plug it in and it's fine
Is this rechargeable or does it use batteries? If batteries, what size and how many? Thanks!
Hello Bill, yes it is rechargeable I normally get about 7 to 10 days of play from mine. 2 hours a few days during the week and a good 7 to 8 on the weekends.
can I use in mac?
I don't know, I don't have a mac.
DOES IT COME WITH A CHARGING CABLE?
Yes it does, but it's very short.
Does this controller work well with call of duty games
I've played it with ghost, it worked just fine. I'm not sure about the turbo I think it worked but I'm not positive I prefer to do it my self anyway. Ghost has the option to change the triggers so it is similar to other Xbox but they had to be pulled down pretty far to register the shot so I didn't like it much. But it does work
Ok guys I have a very specific question how does this Elite Gaming controller compare to the PowerA Fusion Tournament controller as far as the presicion of the joysticks and their durability? From my experience the presicion on the Fusion Tournament...
it wrecks it
Does it come with the carrying case?
Hi, yes it comes with a fairly good semi hard type carry case, which holds everything you need together securely and offers good travel/ storage protection for everything inside.
can i plug this directly into a computer and still use it successfully?
that's how your supposed to use it.
i have a wireless adapter for my pc. would this controller sync to it so i can play wirelessly on my pc??
Unfortunately it won't as the Sabertooth has no wireless capabilities.
Can I change the mapping of the buttons and/or the analog sticks? Im looking for a way to remap the analog sticks to play bioshock.
On PC you can set the button mappings to whatever you want. You can make the trigger the jump button and b button fire if you want. It depends on the game. On Xbox it will function like an Xbox controller only, but you can assign a button to the extra buttons on the controllers integrated display.
The additional buttons on this controller act like the Scuf Gaming's paddles right?
yes. the rockers and the additional shoulder buttons can be programmed to serves as any other button on the controller. you cant program new functions but you can program the rockers with the axby buttons so your thumb never has to leave the stick, for example.
Does anyone know if there is a wireless version?
There is no wireless version, sorry!
Can you use the hammerhead pro headset with this when playing on the xbox 360?
gaming head sets for xbox have a line for stereo out and a line to the controller for chat. The line for chat that goes to the controller is a 2.5 jack, the headset is a 3.5 jack. better off to contact Razer support to see if a splitter will work before you buy. A proper gaming headset is better if you will be using it for long periods and won't damage your hearing as much in the future. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Is this work for windows 8?
Yes it does work with windows 8
can i use this for pc gaming?
Yes
Is this the stealth version? If not, are you going to be offering the stealth version on Amazon?
All of these people are wrong in some way. This is the non-stealth version with features Cherry MX Blue switches, which are tactile, mechanical switches with a defined break point and "clicky" feedback. The stealth version uses Cherry MX Brown switches, which are also tactile, mechanical switches, but do not have "clicky" feed back and have an actuation force about 10g less than the Cherry MX Blues. I'm not sure why Razer doesn't make one available using MX Blacks, since they are better for gaming then either the MX Blues or Browns. Anyway, Ben is wrong because the Nostromo/Tartarus uses RUBBER DOME MEMBRANE switches, NOT mechanical ones like the Stealth does. Jarlax is wrong because the switches are quite different, the clicky feedback with the Blues is MUCH more pronounced than the Browns. I should mention that while I don't actually own this particular product, I am very familiar with mechanical keyboards and gaming accessories. Hope that was of some help.
So, I gather the D-Pad is more sensitive than that of the nostromo n52. Owners: did you get used to it? I want to use it for WASD.
I've never used the Nostromo, but I can tell you that the D-Pad is very sensitive in my opinion. It has a good solid click to it, and each of the 8 positions can be mapped to whichever keys you like. The only problem I've had is that the 4 diagonal positions are very hard to achieve without first actuating one of the "polar" positions. In other words, say you wanted position 2 which would be between W and D in your case. I've found it's nigh impossible to actuate position 2 without actuating either W or D first on accident. But if you are primarily using it for the polar values, it works pretty well.
DOES A GAMING KEYPAD REPLACE A GAMING KEY BOARD?
Yes and no. It will replace some functions, but not typing. The keypad will replace the left side of the keyboard essentially, but you can map the keys to anything.
Hello, has anyone used the Orbweaver in place of a 3D space navigator like one by 3D Conexxion? I am hoping to use one device for both purposes. ^.^
I own both devices, one is not even remotely like the other. The Orbweaver is wonderful for gaming, but the 3D mouse is an incredible design that allows you to almost feel like you are handling the model you are working on. If you have never used a 3D mouse and do CAD or animation design in 3D, you need to buy the 3D mouse, it is awesome.
Does the razer software allow you to assign the buttons as "direct input buttons (directx)" so I can configure them using another profiling software?
the software allows you to do almost any thing that you can do mechanical, if you set it up to do a function such as ctrl+alt+w and set the function up in the other program it might be possible as you can set a button to switch programs and the macro part is quite extensive if i knew more of what you wanted to do in the software i could give you a more definitive answers.however it also depends on the second set of profiling software that you use and the application e.g some app's might work better then others depending on the amount of gui based controles eg web browsers clicking on a button is not easy but you can thell it to write a sentence where you have clicked.
Wife tried Nostromo and her small hand felt slightly strained to hold in the WASD position. Is this better for smaller hands?
This has an extra row so with smaller hands I'd imagine it would be harder to reach the extra row. It would probably be slightly better to hold in the WASD position due to the adjustable palm rest and the slider all the way closed if she doesn't care to use the extra row.
[Solved] Does the Orbweaver store the active profile on the device like the n52te does? Does it have only the dpad for the thumb buttons?
With the new software it looks like it saves it on your computer BUT it tries to get it from the cloud. The result is that (at least for me) it just kept forgetting which profile to use. In some cases I had to reboot to get it to select my new profile. the thumb has the dpad plus an extra button.
I have small hands and I'm used to three rows of buttons (nostromo). Are 4 rows doable for most people?
I have somewhat smaller hands and I can barely reach the third row. So I am currently just using the bottom 2.
Can you use the joystick to scroll? Ideally I would like it to be able to vertical scroll and horizontal scroll for webpages and excel.
Yes. The joystick comes pre-mapped as the arrow keys. So you could scroll like that. Or you may be able to customize it in some way. You could remap some of the joystick directions as mouse scroll wheel movement. For instance when you press the stick forward it acts as if you rolled the mouse scroll wheel forward, that should be fairly smooth for webpages. Hope this helps
I am looking to hook my computer up to my TV and play on the couch with a lap desk. Will a keypad enable me to do that without needing a keyboard?
This is strictly for gaming, not a replacement for a keyboard
does it work on xbox
Yes, pretty much anything with a component video feed. Isn't the best quality.
can i use it on a computer monitor
I beleive you can if you have RGB and OYR on the monitor so you can stack up dem subs!
whats the recording video type? 720p 1080p ?
My husband and grandson tried to get it to work but didn't. May be the gamecap may not. Don't recommend if you are not tech savvy.
work's in Mac??
Yes it does work in. MACS
so i can record videos with this and upload them to youtube?
That is the idea behind it. But for the price it is not worth it. Poor quality if you can even get it to work. If your serious about making videos get something like an elgato capture card. It's expensive but very high quality. If you just want to test the water and see where it goes get something like a dazzle. Do not buy this one
does it come with a microphone
No it does not. Jenny
Does it works for wii
Didn't work at all. Total waste of money
Does this work on CHROME OS?
Honestly I don't know. it didn't work for me when I got it. It was defective so i sent it back
How good of quality?
The quality is very low and the software has many glitches it is not worth the buy
who delivers it ups or usps or fed ex?
Does it madder?
Is this an expansion pack? do i have to buy sims 3 first before i get this?
yes!!! you MUST get sims 3 before buying this!
Does it come with a code?
yes it do come with a code.
-_- I can't get to it! WOW, what a waste of money.
go into "edit world" and see if there is an incon in the upper left corner for the University. If so click on it and see if you can edit the university world. If not, you need to uninstall it and re-install it. If you can reach the university in "edit world", try switching households and going there with a different Sim (waring everything in your refrigerator will disappear unless you store it in a treasure box).
The installation is not working !!!!!!! It says that you have to have sims 3 installed before? WASTE OF MONEY
Yes, you have to already own the Sims 3 core game. This particular game is a expiation pack.
What's the code
Sign into your amazon Account, hover your mouse over Your Account to get the drop down menu, then close to the bottom is Games and Software Library. All games purchased will be in chronological order, showing the Title, Platform, File Size, and then Product Code. Hope this helps :)
it says that i must download sims 3 do i have to?
yes university life is a expansion
when im downloading the game it says things about my internet connection but my internet connection is working perfectly, so why isnt it downloading?
Try turning off your internet and turning it back on to make sure it is connected, the try red own loading the game. If you are using origin, close it and reopen then try redownloading. If that still doesn't work, restart tour computer. Contact EA if nothing works.
do u need the bais game
Yes you will need the base game.
TS3 tells me that I need to update it and then install University life but I have updated more than 10 times!!! it seems like they do not rlly update
Hello Gloria, I hope you are enjoying The Sims 3 University Life Expansion Pack, as much as I did. - To answer your question, yes, ALL updates are necessary when purchasing a brand new expansion pack. When the game was created, it was created to cater to the game version at THAT point in time. Since The Sims 3 is a game powered by Origin, it gives opportunity to make your game as up to date and fluid as possible; and considering how long ago it was created vs. when you purchased it, there have been many updates for The Sims 3 sense. Thus, your computer needs an opportunity to catch itself up with the newest version of the game so that you have the best utmost experience. I hope that this helps and wish for you to keep this thought in mind when purchasing any additional The Sims 3 Expansion Packs, as you will run into the same situation. Not all updates show immediate, apparent results. Some updates are simply code related and with make your gameplay more fluid / less glitchy. Again, I hope that this has helped. Happy Simming! :-)
If I get the PC download for it, can I download it on a Mac the next time through Origin?
I don't believe so. I'm not 100% sure but I think I tried this with my sisters Mac and discovered that it didn't work.

If i buy the codes online will i be able to play with just this disc?
No, I believe this is just the add on. You're better off finding an all inclusive edition if you dont have the originals already.
If I buy this disc, will I code to add it to my account? Will I get it instant or have to wait?
no you dont have wait your registration code should be on back of the manul you do have to register your code online with square cinx though in order to play the game
i have the 2008 version which does not have the 6 add-ons and the this expansion, if I buy this expansion and the 6 add-on codes what disc will need to be inserted?
Any xbox 360 ffxi disc will work aslong as you have the game installed and the codes registered.
Hello, I ordered this game and when i tried registering for my playonline account it said the Registration code was invalid/used.
If you bought the game used, then yes you would need a new registration code and if you bought the game new, then id file a claim with amazon that the seller misrepresented the item you bought.
What do I need to be able to play this? do I have to buy another game? does it cost monthly?
You need to have the original FFXI game installed. You can get the game with all the expansions on one disc. You also need an internet connection as its an online game. Yes it has a monthly fee.
i have the 2008 version which is missing this expansion plus 6 add-ons, if i buy the codes online will it work by using just this disc?
Yes, you can use any FFXI related gamedisc to launch the game on 360. As long as you register the codes you buy online to your square-enix account you'll be fine. It will download/update any content you're missing automatically.
Will this work on a Mac / OS X and being that the instructions aren't in English, are the buttons programmable without instructions?
Not programmable but compatable.
Can someone please tell me the battery life on this mouse before I buy? (I use the comp 6-8 hrs a day with some Diablo 2 and 3)
Mines still running after a few months so I'd say it's good enough for that
Do the side buttons (page up/page down) work on mac? My keyboard doesn't have page up/down keys?
I don't know but I think you can configure them to.
How do we program the buttons? Is there software we need to download?
As far as I can tell, you can only program them for programs that let you change button configs. You have to go into the button config of the program and set each of the buttons to what you want.
Hey my mouse isn't working. Does anybody know where i can download a driver for it?
That's weird, my mouse worked right when I plugged it in. Make sure its on (switch on the bottom), plugged in (wireless USB reciever), and the light on your mouse is on. If all of those are working, then I have no idea.
Does anyone know is exist a software for this mouse???
Didnt recieve any software with the mouse and could not locate any. Now, having said that, its fairly easy to set the function for each of the buttons. Simply press the key on the keyboard you want a button to use while holding down the button on the mouse.....wait a minute...I think its the other way round...hold down the keyboard then select the mouse button...hmmm.....cant remember now for sure...&lt;laugh&gt; Doesnt matter, just try either way and whichever one will work.
how many clicks does this have?
They mailed me a totally wrong mouse with different name...but mine has 2 clicks.
Can this mouse move back and forward between web pages with the side buttons?
Yes, the side buttons also function as "back" and "forward" buttons on the internet.
Can this mouse move back and forward between web pages with the side buttons?
yes
is the mouse a silent click mouse ?
If your asking if it's like the sound of a mechanical one no. Other than that it has the normal click noise... (Also depends on how hard you hit it)
Does it come with instructions?
no the instructions are on the page you order from .
yes it is a jitter what is it a yy or xyy
I don't know what you mean by that... what's a yy or xyy?

No, it has a little button in the back of the controller that you hold for about 5 sec to shut it off and you just press it to turn it on.

Per grandson: "The jitter mod is pretty good". Nana: "Are there any challenges with it?" Grandson: "Nope. Just the triggers". Hope this helps :)

Have you checked the add on amazon I believe that it says but other than that I don't know

Yup it does
How do u use this control
Press LT & sync at the same time to turn the mod on and again to turn it off. While on press sync to cycle through all 17 mods. Excellent controller if your looking for a good bang for your buck.
Will this work for Halo 4?
It's literally just an xbox 360 controller. It will work for any game on the xbox 360.
would i get banned on cod 2
Yes
can i get banned on mw2 and mw3 for using this controller
Possibly yes , but the chance of that happening is nearly impossible.

Can I use any battery pack for this remote? It's because I have my own rechargeable battery packs,so yea
Yaaa you can I use a rechargeable batter pack too and it works fine
Why the headphones automatically shutdown ten minutes on pc?
It's a feature in the headset not sure why they put it in even go to their website and go for the FAQ for that device you will find a crappy solution for this issue in which they want you to blow into your mic every like 10 minutes or so.
Was the packaging already opened upon arrival?
Not for me. Brand new
Will this headset work on the xbox 360 &amp; the xbox one? Looking for a headset that will work on both.
Yes it does both. In fact it comes with a wireless dangle for the 360 so u can have wireless chat, but u have to buy a adapter for the one but it's like 24$
is this xbox one compatibility
Yes
Do they work with the ps4
Absolutely. For reference, Turtle Beach actually has a useful naming system. If the model has a "P" in the name, it is compatible with Playstation models. An "X" for Xbox 360. An "O" for Xbox One. And so on. Please just make sure to check for and apply any system updates.
do these have 7.1 dolby surround sund
Yes, the XP510 provides surround sound for Xbox 360, PS4 and PS3 consoles. You can also use it with an Xbox One if you add a chat adapter and a talkback cable.
Does this headset have mic monitoring?
Yes, the XP510 has variable mic monitoring. Most of our wireless and amplified wired headsets have mic monitoring. We feel it is an important feature.
Does it have a warranty?
Yes, it has a one year "limited" manufacturer's warranty, which is typical for electronics. However, because of the cost of the headset I would buy the extended warranty, if available. I purchased my headset at Best Buy and paid an additional 89 bucks (?) I think for 2 more years of warranty over the standard warranty.
On Turtle Beach website it says it's compatible with XBOX One via the earforce headset adapter. Are you sure it's not compatible?
I think it's compatible but it only worked once for me. When I tried to change settings it no longer worked.
Is it possible to use one set of headphones with an XBox 360, PS3, PS4, and XBox 1?
If I'm not mistaken, it works with all of them but needs a special connection for the Xbox One.

Just To be clear it can be used with a pc and how would I connect it to my pc?
The transmitter has optical in or rca type inputs if your sound card has those or you can use a usb Bluetooth adapter or the mobile device cable for a wired connection direct to the headset from any mp3,mp4 player,smart phone,tablet or your computer headphone jack. The user manual is available @ http://www.turtlebeach.com/support/entry/830517491/
PS4 users, while playing and chatting, are there any cables connected to/from the headset/controller? or only cables between console/transmitter?
You must use a chat cable between headset and controller.
is this compatible with xbox one
Yes but you will need to buy a turtle beach headset audio controller for chat functionality
When paired by bluetooth to a Vita, do these headphones suffer from the dreaded 0.5-1.0 second audio delay like so many other bluetooth audio devices?
Although I do not know of a delay, I can tell you the bluetooth on these headphones are trash.
What exactly do you need to make this compatible w/ Xbox One (of note--you are talking to a video-game ignorant mom here)? Thanks!
Hope i'm not too late for your question. You actually need an adapter, check http://www.turtlebeach.com/console-compatibility and click on the model.
Can you pair it to multiple devices at the same time?
Yes. The headset's bluetooth port can only channel one bluetooth source at a time, but I frequently connect my laptop via bluetooth and listen to music through that connection, while also listening to a feed I create from the wifi base, which I connect to my PS4 via digital audio.
What's the digital out port on the transmitter used for? Can I plug speakers into it so I can listen either through the headphones or speakers?
The digital out port on the transmitter allows it to act as a digital audio pass thru. So you can daisy chain headsets or other devices. So yes, you could pass the audio from the transmitter out to a stereo system or speakers as long as they had an optical input.
If connected to PS4 with a cable, can you control chat volume and Mute by button which on the headset?
Actually, if you use a cord for PS4 chat you should purchase the PS4 Talkback cable, it has mic mute and mic volume control on the cord itself. The mute and chat volume buttons on the headset only work with wireless bluetooth to the PS3.
My headset keep turning off while in the middle of a game, does anyone else experience this? Happens in the middle of gameplay.
I don't have that problem. It is easy to hit any of the buttons every time you touch them though.
How small/large is the headband? I have a small head, size 6 hat size.
Its not that small, but as with another headsets you can adjust the headband so it rest nicely on you head and hears, and if you think that its going to feel loosely, the headset really trt to push the earpads to your head just enough, so you dont need to worry about going to fall from your head. And its very confortable for long periods of play.

What is the name of the other bonus games?
Girls with secrets, judge dee and night in the opera. There are 3 bonus games
Does anyone know how to get past the point of the downed tree in front of the path? I have started 3 times and keep getting stuck here.
The hint button will give you info about it or you can also google the walk thru for the game and go to that section of instruction.
How does it compare to the Logitech G600? I own a G600 and my fat thumb has a hard time finding the 12 side buttons. I end up only using 3 or 4
I had the g600 before i got this.The buttons take some getting used to when you first get it but the build material and quality is a lot higher than the logitech. The buttons are easier to press on the corsair one once you get used to where they are at also.
I have a SteelSeries 4HD mouse pad,would this work well with a plastic coated pad? I currently have a Naos 5000 that's getting worn out.
Yes, the Corsair M95 will work perfectly on most surfaces. After you download software for the M95 off the Corsair website, you can run a test and the M95 will detect the quality of the mouse mat. That will make the mouse be able to be more accurate on the mouse mat you are using.
Does this mouse have a middle-click function on the scroll wheel separate from the button below it?
Yes, the wheel is also utilized as a button.
is it compatible with windows 8.1
The corsair website say's Win7, Win8, XP, Vista. So I would say it should work with 8.1 http://www.corsair.com/us/gaming-peripherals/gaming-mice/vengeance-m95-performance-mmo-and-rts-laser-gaming-mouse-gunmetal-black.html
Is this mouse comfortable with large hands, i currently have a g600 and it just isn't comfortable for my meaty hands anymore....
yeah, this mouse is perfect for big hands.
can you turn led off
Yes the software lets you turn off the leds
can I set the side buttons as keyboard keys? e.g. side button 1 is " R " , so if I press that, I can reload in games
Yes, yes you can.
Does this mouse have any type of pinky rest? I can't tell by the pictures.
No, it has the buttons on the left, and there's a spot to grip it on the right but no pinky rest
This mouse is 100Hz or 1000Hz? Just wondering if it was a typo or not.
1000Hz max (1ms response time).
When will this become available?
It's available for purchase now.
Is there any option to set this game to Japanese language with English subtitles?
No, but it's still a great game.
Is there an English strategy guide available? I am only seeing the Japanese guides in searches.
Unfortunately, there's no solid copy strategy guide in English. However, there are many excellent strategy guides/walkthroughs available to read online. The ones at gamefaqs stand out above the others, and have in-depth information on characters, storyline, as well as trophy guides. Here's the link: http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps3/616012-tales-of-xillia/faqs. Hope this helps.
I've never played a Tales game before but i tend to adapt to games at a good pace so will i be ok starting with this one?
None of the tales games really go together, except for games like xillia+xillia 2. Any game would be fine.
is this in english
Yes, both text and voice dialogue are in English.
How does this series compare to final fantasy?
This series doesn't take itself quite as seriously as final fantasy does. I would say that besides ff7, ff6, and ff9 this game was much more enjoyable than the rest. I have played through it twice and each time racked up over 100 hours. Give it a try
Have spanish subtittles?
Yes. It has
Is there just the game CD inside the case or mine has something missing?
Hi. Unfortunately only the CD. No booklet with the game nor anything like it :(
Can this game be played co-op?
Yup! Battles only of course and not until you have enough party members.
Is this the official US release? Also, there's 3 different sellers and this one is significantly cheaper. Is this legit? Thanks! :)
Yes, this is the Official States release. But third-party sellers like to list other versions under the NA release sometimes so be careful. You're best bet is to contact the seller directly and ask what region it is. This happened to me once. Good luck.
is it multi player
Yes it is but when you link to a character only one person can use the pair
for those of us who are lousy at game players are there any cheat codes for this version of the game and can you play offline by yourself . just want play the game on my own with infinite ammo etc and not online. like I do rez5 and operation raccoon...
I don't know about cheat codes, but if you get stuck, you can pull up a walk thru online, and find out how to beat a particular spot where you keep getting killed. Probably best to stay at the amateur level. You can play either on or offline, but I don't think you can get infinite ammo.
can you play this game on windows 8
Yes, no problem
can i redeem this on steam
Yea
does this dvd require steam to play the game cause i hate steam and im looking for a non steam ver to mod if you got a non steam ver.
Yes
can you play co-op with someone when one person has it on steam and the other has it as a hard copy (both pc)?
There should be no problem as long as you are both online and logged into Steam. It is the same game regardless of whether you got it from disk or digital download.
is this like a CD and you put it in the computer and all good will be able to play or i have to install program and be online .?thanks
well its easy you only just put it on your computer and Install the game probably it will update something if you have internet connection at the installation process but its easy to install. XD good luck
So, does this work for pc users in the U.S.? UK editions being sold on the bay say PAL.
PC version runs on any computer with Windows (from XP to 8 I guess) and the game minimum requirements. Only console versions could have a region code (pal or ntsc), which could vary in different countries.
How is the game play with using a keyboard and mouse? Does it feel like CoD or MoH?
it's like any shooter at 3rd person, it's a very cool game.
So is this like a steam key? Or a physical disc?
Its a disk that activates a steam game
Does capcom choose the game version or is that done by steam?
if you mean does the game have software updates and patches managed by steam, then yes. or if you are asking about different language options (spoken and text), then that is managed from the steam launcher.
Can this be played offline once downloaded?
Yes it can.
steam
No steam.
will this game work with windows eight?
Yes it will
Are all the DLCs included?
Here's hoping! Well I did find this description, although I have not found this list anywhere else as of yet: Tropico 4: Collectors Bundle combines all the latest Tropico 4 goodness. Bundle Includes: *Tropico 4 *Tropico 4: DLC Modern Times *Tropico 4: DLC Junta *Tropico 4: DLC Plantador *Tropico 4: DLC Quick-Dry-Cement *Tropico 4: DLC Pirate Heaven *Tropico 4: DLC Megalopolis *Tropico 4: DLC Vigilante

Since this is Bluetooth, will it work on a pc or laptop with bluetooth?
Unfortunately I havent been able to get to work.
The controller shows up on my FireTv stick but will not pair. Anyone else run in to this? Anyone figure out how to fix it?
Back in July I've tried most every platform that you could imagine... most probably it'll never work. You should return it to your vendor if you can.
Is it updated to new firmware, to the one it makes it an HID-compatible?
***DO NOT BUY*** The software has been discontinued and it is very hard to hack. I now have a useless controller due to that fact.
Does it work with the OUYA console?
No its not compatable with the OUYA console. On a side note Forbes magazine dubbed the OUYA "basically dead" you should pack it up and wait for it to be worth something for collectors lol
is it for kindle
Yes it is for apps that you can get on kindle
Will it work with kindle fire HDX
It has blue tooth compatibility. I ordered it and had to return because I had original kindle fire. Made the mistake. New hdx should be good to go. I was aiming to use with all my old Roms from n64, the controller is identical to Xbox and just as good quality. Can't guarantee longevity tho. Like I said I returned mine.
Can I use the controller on an nVidia Shield without the Arena app - say in a game like Asphalt or an emulator like n64oid?
The good news Abhinav is that this controller is designed with nVidia powered devices in mind. The bad news, unfortunately the arena app acts in 2 ways, first as a device driver of sorts and second as a market place to limit you to only compatable games that it deems your device powerful enough to play. Don't fret, there is 2 more bits of good news. Once the controller is paired with your device the controller is recognized as an individual device even after app is gone. And, if your device is Android 4.1 or higher it has a built-in XBox 360 controller support for a wired controller, you need a standard USB A to USB Micro adapter to make it work.
Is it updated to new firmware, to the one it makes it an HID-compatible?
Yes, the firmware is updated
will this work on a 2nd generation kindle fire
I am not sure I have only used it with my Fire HD!
after i insert the disk and the game starts installing, it asks for a product code. Where can I find it?
You can find it in your Amazon purchases. Go to Your Orders and then, under the product, it should give you the product code.
Does this work with windows 7
Yes,no problem...
Can you play the PC version 2 player, or is it just single player?
2 players. But bigger monitor but better view.
If I buy the PC DVD, do I need to download anything apart from Steam? If yes, how large is the game download? Limited bandwidth so this is important.
If you purchase the PC DVD, then there should not be any bandwidth required. All of the data should come on the disc to install the game. I'm not sure you need Steam if you purchase a disc, either. I did not purchase a disc. I downloaded it; so, I can only speak based on the information that I have. It will take up approx. 6Gb of hard disk space for the game without any additional DLC. If you choose to purchase a download key, you will need to install Steam (1.5Mb from www.steampowered.com) as well as the Lego Marvel game (6315Mb or ~6Gb). You must register for a Steam account in order to use its services. If you have access to a retailer that has a copy in stock, you may want to read the box for details and see if it answers your questions. I hope this was helpful.
Does this work with windows 8.1?
Yes. Steam required.
How many gigabytes does it use after I buy the disk and insert into my xbox?
Hi Patty. Note that this is for a Windows PC, so I can't say for sure whether or not it will work on an Xbox. Here's the following from the back of the disc case that might help answer your question concerning storage: "Minimum System Requirements - 7GB available space, 1GB RAM for Windows XP, 2GB RAM for Windows Vista/7/8." Also "Recommended System Requirements - 7GB available space and 4GB RAM." I hope this helps.
Any chance I could get this to work in Linux?
I don't think so. However, Steam has a platform they built on Linux that runs games.
Does this game have to be played only when installed previous versions?or buy and play just right away with internet?
buy and play.
does it have to use inernet
Yes. It's a link to the Steam system which actually holds the game. There is no way to play the game without internet.
I bought this used and I can't download it to my daughter's laptop because it says the validation code has been used. What can I do?
I think you should contact the customer support of amazon or steam.
I bought these by accident (Grandmaaaa!) Can you play them on a PS2??
No because it do not work.
how many players
I know for a fact it is up to two players on the same console.
is it two player
Yes, it is two player, just like all the Lego games are.
does this have hawkeye
Yes hawkeye needs to be unlocked
this in Spanish? because I live in Paraguay
This game is in English only and you cannot change the settings in the game to hear/read Spanish. However that is not the main problem for you if it even was one. This game is one of many PlayStation3 games that are region locked. This game is region 1 which means it will only work in North America (Canada, USA, Mexico). You need a Region 4 Lego Marvel Super Heroes game.
What is the diffeence between the game for $19.99 and the one for $39.99? Is it becuase the rating is pending on the $19.99 one?
I think that one might be the "new" version and the other could be a "used" version.
I want to know what language is this game .....
My son who plays this says it's in English.
how many players can play at once?
Two players at the same time
Has anyone had problems with this game locking up? Mine seems to do it about once every mission.
Yes, not quite that often but more than any other Lego game I've played, so annoying
how many players is this game
One player, or two-player co-operative. No online multiplayer.

Yes, it sure does. Even though my 2 young grandsons are the only ones playing, their enthusiasm sounds like every superhero on the planet, is in their room, too! w. young
how many players can play at a time?
2
Is this just for kids or can adults enjoy the game?
Well, I believe it all depends on whether adult enjoys the LEGO video game style or not. I am not precisely a LEGO video games enthusiast but I like video games in general, so if my boy - who loves this video game - calls me in to join him I am pretty sure I will enjoy gaming with him.
How many levels are in the XBox 360 version? Anyone know?
I not sure a bunch though. They have been playing off and on since Christmas and still haven't unlocked all the characters.
Must it be continually connected to the internet, or just once at start-up to run "steam"? PLEASE REPLY! Thanks.
We no longer have any internet/cable other than our cell phones. All of it is connected through the Xbox360 just like a VCR or CD player. They just put on the disc and it plays . Internet is only if its multi-player if you want to play people you don't know. Lego Marvel Superheroes is also disc only. The Xbox-One...you must have internet because most of their games are online. We purchased Xbox 360 for about $30.00 on Craigslist and purchased older TV's 40 inch from thrift stores for about $10.00. Both work fine:-)
Is this the Avengers?
No, it's all the Marvel superheroes. The Avengers are are in it though.
How much free space do you need.
I would recommend having at least 1 gigabyte or less for game saves, if you want to install it you need at least 10 gigabytes of storage.
Do you need a specific amount of free data on your Xbox to play it
Yes
can 3 people play this game together
No... only 1 or 2 people. Bummer.
Hi. I have a US Xbox 360. Will this play or it is locked to some other Zone
I bought my Xbox in Colombia (same USA region). I can not help in this part. What I can tell you is that the game did not work at all.
does it have multiplayer mode
Yes, it sure does. Even though my 2 young grandsons are the only ones playing, their enthusiasm sounds like every superhero on the planet, is in their room, too! w. young

We no longer have any internet/cable other than our cell phones. All of it is connected through the Xbox360 just like a VCR or CD player. They just put on the disc and it plays . Internet is only if its multi-player if you want to play people you don't know. Lego Marvel Superheroes is also disc only. The Xbox-One...you must have internet because most of their games are online. We purchased Xbox 360 for about $30.00 on Craigslist and purchased older TV's 40 inch from thrift stores for about $10.00. Both work fine:-)
Is this the Avengers?
No, it's all the Marvel superheroes. The Avengers are are in it though.
How much free space do you need.
I would recommend having at least 1 gigabyte or less for game saves, if you want to install it you need at least 10 gigabytes of storage.
Do you need a specific amount of free data on your Xbox to play it
Yes
can 3 people play this game together
No... only 1 or 2 people. Bummer.
Hi. I have a US Xbox 360. Will this play or it is locked to some other Zone
I bought my Xbox in Colombia (same USA region). I can not help in this part. What I can tell you is that the game did not work at all.
What age is this game best suitable for? I have a 5 and 4yr old and was wondering if this is a game they could play.
My 7 and 8 year olds do great with it. My 5 year old struggled. He mostly just runs around and hits things. The Lego games are great because they are much like puzzles. You have to try and figure out the sequence of actions are before you can move forward. This proves a little challenging for my 5 year old and I would think most 4-5 year olds would enjoy it for the fact that they can "be Iron Man" or other character but they won't progress much in the game on their own and may get bored after a few minutes and want "help". Hope that helps.
how does the multiplayer work? is it split screen?
When I play with my son and we are close to each other, its 1 screen but as soon as one of us trails off, it goes split screen and when we reconnect, it goes to 1 screen again. Hope that helps.
Do you need a Wii U to play this game or can you play the game on just the Wii?
If it says Wii U, it will NOT work in Wii
Does this game include the DLC characters?
I don't think it does, however, the game comes with roughly 100+ characters right out the box. You have to complete missions to unlock the characters.
is this compatible with a regular wii
no... you would have to get the wii version -- anything with wii u does not work in the wii
have spanish language???
yes it does Jorge Rodriguez
So playing with only one player, you MUST use the gamepad? And if you are playing two player, the 1st player has to use the gamepad?
That is correct and player one must use the gamepad, but just switch controllers for fave characters.
Can you use the pro controller with this game?
Yes, you can use the pad control and the regular control and the nunchuk.
Will this game work on a Wii U sold in Greece???
To be honest....I'm not 100% sure.
Can you do free roam like in lego batman 2???
Yes. I tend to make my way through the levels and then go back and do levels in free play and explore the city, but you can. The nicest thing is that as you complete "city" tasks, new tasks open up. So you're not overwhelmed with tasks and it kind of make the game last longer.

What are the 18 games on this game?
Christmas Carole Chameleon Alice Big Money Show Blast Zone Burnin Love Clover Cash Engine no. 1 Fairy Tales Kilauea Maraschinos Robin Hood Shimmer They Came From Outer Space 3 Witches Tiger' Realm Xerxes
After installation, would I need to have the disc to play?
It has been working for me without the disc in, but I have other WMS games also installed and as long as I have one of their discs in, I can switch to the other games without switching discs.
I installed on my other computer and was able to do something so that I did not have to have the disc in. Can't remember what the secret was. Anyone?
it's been so long I forget. and don;t have the item installed anymore. sorry I couldn't be of more help.
installation?
What did you want to know about the installation?
instructions
What part of the instructions are you having trouble with?
how too install with windows 8 ?
there should have been a small catalog that came with the gameclick start button or emblem click computer or my computer right click on the dvd-rom drive left click open or explore locate file named setup.exe.it should look blue with sail-boats double click setup.exe to start installation follow on screen instructions to install i have windows 8 it asks if i want to put this on my computer i check yes by the way i finished my dvd loved it good luck
Is this mechanical?
No. It isn't.
The back light color, are there other color selections available, or is it stuck in the default blue as shown in the preview pictures?
just the blue
Do the keys stay lit continuously? Or can they be made to?
There is a button on the top right that cycles through high, low, and off and the keyboard stays lit on high and low as long as the computer is sending power to it.
How long is the cord?
It's about 3 feet
Is it possible to program one of the G keys to go to a website? Use as a hot URL? Or only for gaming purposes? {:^(-
If you're using the logitech software that maps all the keys for you then yes, you can map the key to open a website, toggle another program, etc
How loud is this keyboard?
It's not very quiet but I've owned louder.
Clarification of previous question. I am actually interested in programming macro keys at home, then bringing to work. Are macros saved?
Yes. Macros are modified via the software (or use of the M1-3 and MR keys) and saved to the internal memory.
are the keys rubberized?
No
is there a volume control key?
FN + F6 to mute FN + F7 lower FN + F8 higher
How big is it? Some of the gaming keyboards seem to be made for huge hands and mine are probably pretty average woman hands.
It's not easy quantifying this. Assuming you are using for gaming, the WASD keys are a little more the 3/4 of an inch apart, center to center. The G keys are a little more than an inch and a half apart from the left edge of the "a" key to the right edge of the nearest G key (G4 in this case). It may help to know what games you play, how you plan to use the keyboard, and possibly how far you can stretch your pinky comfortably.
what does the button do?
The default setting of it will change the sensor DPI based on settings in the control panel for the mouse. They can range from 250-2500 and you can have 3 preset ranges to cycle through. In addition if you don't want/need the settings changed it can be reassigned for other functions also in the control panel along with being disabled if not needed at all.
Is the scroll wheel stepped or freewheel?
stepped
Win xp compatible?
It should work without problems, at least as a generic mouse.
can programmable buttons be programmed for things like double click, copy, paste? My old mouse does and I find it very convenient.
Yes they can with the Logitech Gaming Mouse software :)
What is the length of the cord?
About 6 feet
Can I use the wheel to click?
yes, very easily too
Does this work on Mac
Yes. It will work on Mac. However some users have reported some issues with Macs, though it should at least be usable.
Might be a stupid question, but is this mouse compatible with OS X software?
Yes it is.
Does this work on glass?
It does not work on glass
How big is the mouse. I don't care about the size of packaging.
Its a slightly larger mouse but it feels great for those who curve grip the mouse
how does its size compare to the G502 Proteus Core which I've seen at Best Buy? My grandson is 14 and wants a little bit smaller mouse than some.
The G400s is larger, but it is very well designed to the form of a hand. It may be more comfortable for your grandson...
I currently have the MX 518. Anyone have a comparison in both use and size? I have smaller hands and have a heck of time finding a gaming mouse.
not sure about mx 518 but the g400s is very narrow an long fits my hands perfectly and I have medium size hands
Is there warranty if you buy it from Amazon? Tried to get my G400 replaced but because the order was fulfilled by CT-X (through amazon) they declined.
did you received a receipt with the purpose? if amazon or CT-X still declined the replacement, contact the manufacture "Logitech". go to http://www.logitech.com and click on the contact us link. just make sure you got the original purchase receipt.
Is the G 400 S the same size as the G400?
It's 1:1 the exact same shape and size. The only thing different is the color and the internals.
Does this have adjustable weights? If not does it feel too heavy or too light in your opinion. Does this come with a warranty in case it breaks?
No it does not have weights. It feels a bit light but the feel is good. Can't remember the warranty, but I'm sure it has one.
I got the free shipping.. i hope it doesnt take weeks to arrive. Anyone else get theirs sooner?
Very fast shipping. I got free shipping and it arrived in 5 days.
Can the "+" and "-" buttons be programmed
+ / - I'm not sure mouse3 (wheel click) mouse4 (back on internet) mouse5 (forward on internet) I know those work. The others might with the Logitech driver stuff installed. I just PnP mine.
Hi, is this mouse blue or grey? Thanks.
Yes, both. It's grey around the outside, the top where you rest your fingers is a dark blue-grey with black stripes.
Does this work with Windows XP?
This mouse does not have native software support for Windows XP; although--aside from possibly the Logitech gaming software--this mouse should still plug and play. This is a best guess based on experiences, but not a guarantee.
How does the backlighting compare to the venerable G11? Dimmer, brighter, same?
BRIGHTER
Are the WASD keys textured or simply just a different shell color?
They are just a different color.
How long does the back light stay on? Can you customize it?
Back light is toggled on/off with a button on the keyboard. As far as I know, there is no way to time it. You can customize the colors and switch them with the profile and macro keys.
Is this wireless? It comes up under a search for wireless, but the pictures seem to show a wire coming out of the top.
Hi James, it's not wireless. Let me know if you have any other questions. :)
Is this keyboard mechanical?
No it is not mechanical.
One picture shows a big palm rest, another shows a little one. Which is it?
The keyboard comes with a hand rest attachment so you can choose which one you want to use. So effectively both :D
Does this keyboard contain a volume button so i can adjust the sound through my keyboard?
Yes
I have an old G15 keyboard and love it, but the keys are way too loud and "clacky". Are he G510's keys loud or quiet?
The G510 is like any normal keyboard, not especially "clacky" on the key strokes (not like mechanical switches).
Can you change the color and/or turn off the key lights for specific keys or is it all or nothing? ie. only light up WASD and a few others in games?
All or Nothing. One color, all the same, on or off.
My kb sets on s slide out tray so over all length is a factor. What's the side to side length of the G510S?
It is difficult to measure, due to the beveled edges, but it measures 20 5/16 inches (20.31").
how do you charge it
You do not charge it. Its USB powered wired headphone. Its not wireless and that's the key point that it conects to every audio-enabled device (mobile, ps3, PC, Xbox)
How durable is this headset? I want one that can last me a few years.
I must have gotten a lemon. Mine broke between the ear cup and the head band after 13-months. It was only ever used at my desk, and I typically handled it with care.
Can this headset be used on desk top computers as well? Also is this set good for listening to music with?
yes it works perfectly with my windows 8.1, and it comes with an attachable amplifier so you can control the musics treble and bass. Music comes out with nice bass and no outside noises.
Whats the difference between frustration free and standard packaging
The frustration free packaging is just the headphones in a plastic sleeve cushioned by foam. You don't need to cut any plastic, just open the box and it is good to go.
Can these be used with the PS4 right out of the box? no adapters or anything?
Don't let the employees of the manufacturer fool you. It is only minimally compatible with the PS4 out of the box. Most of the advertised features, most notably the separate volume controls for the game and chat, require a $35 adapter. Without said adapter, this is a discount headset at a premium headset price.
Will these work for the Xbox ONE?
No it does not work without the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter. Which will run you about another $30 bucks
How long is the cable, is there any way to lengthen it?
The length of unit is over 17.5 feet long. You can extend the length on the headphone side of amp with a male/female 3.5 mm 4-pole extension cable. (Sorry for delay in answer, I was on vacation and just caught up on email)
I understand that I can remove the inline amp and use the headset alone, but what do I lose by removing it? Is it necessary for use on PC?
The Amp is not necessary for PC but you lose the ability to adjust the volume in-line. You would have to use your computer volume instead, plus you lose quite a bit of cord length as the cord from the amp/volume box is only about 3 ft long.
WIIL THESE WORK WITH WII U
Yes! You have two options to make them work: * Unplug them from the box thingy, and plug them right into your GamePad. Control the volume from the gamepad. * Plug them to the box thingy. Use the included adapter to get the audio from your TV's RCA audio output (or use a Component cable, set the audio in your Wii U to _both_ HDMI and component and get the audio from there), and plug the USB to your TV or another power source. Now you can use the box thingy to adjust volume, equalize bass/treble, and also to plug in your phone/tablet (extra cable included) so you can Skype while you Smash!

The length of unit is over 17.5 feet long. You can extend the length on the headphone side of amp with a male/female 3.5 mm 4-pole extension cable. (Sorry for delay in answer, I was on vacation and just caught up on email)
I understand that I can remove the inline amp and use the headset alone, but what do I lose by removing it? Is it necessary for use on PC?
The Amp is not necessary for PC but you lose the ability to adjust the volume in-line. You would have to use your computer volume instead, plus you lose quite a bit of cord length as the cord from the amp/volume box is only about 3 ft long.
WIIL THESE WORK WITH WII U
Yes! You have two options to make them work: * Unplug them from the box thingy, and plug them right into your GamePad. Control the volume from the gamepad. * Plug them to the box thingy. Use the included adapter to get the audio from your TV's RCA audio output (or use a Component cable, set the audio in your Wii U to _both_ HDMI and component and get the audio from there), and plug the USB to your TV or another power source. Now you can use the box thingy to adjust volume, equalize bass/treble, and also to plug in your phone/tablet (extra cable included) so you can Skype while you Smash!

how do you charge it
You do not charge it. Its USB powered wired headphone. Its not wireless and that's the key point that it conects to every audio-enabled device (mobile, ps3, PC, Xbox)
How durable is this headset? I want one that can last me a few years.
I must have gotten a lemon. Mine broke between the ear cup and the head band after 13-months. It was only ever used at my desk, and I typically handled it with care.
Can this headset be used on desk top computers as well? Also is this set good for listening to music with?
yes it works perfectly with my windows 8.1, and it comes with an attachable amplifier so you can control the musics treble and bass. Music comes out with nice bass and no outside noises.
Whats the difference between frustration free and standard packaging
The frustration free packaging is just the headphones in a plastic sleeve cushioned by foam. You don't need to cut any plastic, just open the box and it is good to go.
Can these be used with the PS4 right out of the box? no adapters or anything?
Don't let the employees of the manufacturer fool you. It is only minimally compatible with the PS4 out of the box. Most of the advertised features, most notably the separate volume controls for the game and chat, require a $35 adapter. Without said adapter, this is a discount headset at a premium headset price.
Will these work for the Xbox ONE?
No it does not work without the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter. Which will run you about another $30 bucks

Is it dolby surround sound or stereo?
Stereo
Will it work with Xbox One?
you can hear with them, but the microphone doesn't work with the Xbox One. You'd have to use the Kinect mic to talk.
Can they be used to watch tv?
I have mine hooked up to my TV via the rca cables and on my Sony TV it allows my audio to have multiple audio outputs at once and I can hear anything that will play throught the TV speakers in this set of Headphones. I LOVE them!!! So your answer is YES.
Does this work on Windows 8 PC and is it wireless even for PC's?
I use mine for a Mac and it works wirelessly. I'm not so sure about a PC but I'd assume so.
i just got mine and im not to sure that im happy with it. i don't think it is charging and the users manual isn't exactly to clear. PLEASE CONTACT ME
Dont use them until fully charged
Is there a way to set this up with the ps4?
Yes works on ps4 pc and xbox 360 just fine
What is the product warranty on recertified headsets? Are they backed by the manufacturer or by your company?
I'm not sure but the manufacturer or company should have a warranty.
What is the product warranty for the recertified headset?
One year just like a brand new one
what does recertified mean?
It means that turtle beach as a company, is certifying that this product is up to their standards for resale.
Can they this be used to chat wireless with a PC?
Yes
Can these be used on a cell phone or tablet with standard audio jack?
No, it will not work directly. You need a splitter if you want both audio and mic.
How long is the cable?
It comes with a very long cord, 10 feet(I measured it)...and the cable is not like the plastic ones, it is more like a nylon cord. Great quality for the price
Good Bass Drop?
It's alright. Again, my review stated that you're purchasing a budget gaming headset. You aren't going to get anything stunning for your 30-40 dollar purchase, but you will certainly get more than what is necessary for gaming. You are able to hear environmentals and SFX perfectly. Bass is great for music, not so much environment. If you're looking for a musically dedicated headset, look for those without a mic. Those tend to focus more on the quality of sound and not so much the tandem.
Do they work with Macs?
You will need to purchase a USB adapter. Most recent Macs have a 3.5mm line level input, but the mic will not work without an amplifier or phantom power. The G430 has the adapter included. You can purchase the G430's adapter on an auction site. It will allow you to use the G230 with a USB port.
How can I used the headset for Skype and use the desktop speakers for music at the same time? The headset cuts off the speakers,.
that's not a product question but a technical question related to your operating system and your software/hardware
Whats a good cheap usb sound card to use with this?
I encourage you to ask questions on actual USB sound card products instead.
Should I pay a little extra for G430 surround sound? Is actually worth the extra few bucks in terms of the technology difference?
i personally think this guy's sound really good!! the "surround sound" on the G430 is just the external sound card, the "adapter to convert from 3.5 to USB" and some software tweaks so if you want a headset that can be used on PS3 buy the 430 but if is just for pc then you better buy this one.
Pid and model number
MN#: A-00060 PN#: 881-000215 I think these are correct or very close, it's almost impossible to see. This link tells how to find them, but the sticker is microscopic - http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41626/section/troubleshoot/crid/411/lt_product_id/10786/tabs/1,3,2,4,5/cl/us,en
does the wire get tangled easily?
It does, the wire is pretty long and the method for 'shortening' it is pretty much bunching it up and tying it.
Do the headphones noise cancel? The person I plan on gifting this to lives in a house with a (loud) piano player.
as long as something is playing yes , but if nothing is playing in the headset u can still hear your surroundings but very dim voice

Is bad and you should feel bad.
Does this G700s work on glass? I have the Logitech MX performance, and want more macro keys.
Hmm, I didn't try this until I saw this question. Mine works ok on my glass desk if the desk is slightly dirty from normal use, but after cleaning the desk with Windex the mouse no longer tracks.
Is the scroll wheel free-spinning, has click stops, or switchable (like the MX Revolution)?
It is switchable, similar to the MX Revolution. To switch you press the button just below the wheel instead of pressing the wheel.
Can someone please explain dpi scaling to me? I understand that the higher dpi the easier it is to click on a pixel. Why do people want low dpi?
In comparison a mouse set to a lower dpi will move slower on screen(exp.400dpi will move the pointer 400 pixles for every 1 inch the mouse moves where as 2000dpi can cover a whole 1080i screen with only an inch of mouse movement). Lower dpi can be usefull when an action requires more precise control and higher is great for when the pointer has to travel far and wide.
does the scroll wheel have a page forward, page back left and right thing?
The scroll wheel does have left/right functionality. By default it's "scroll left" and "scroll right" (forward/back are mapped the the buttons by your thumb by default), but you can program them to do whatever you want.
is it unifying
No, it has its own receiver and does not work with Logitech's unifying receiver.
USB 2.0 or 3.0?
The mouse will use any version of usb you have, it doesnt use enough bandwidth to saturate usb 2.0,or 3.0. It preforms the same on any usb version..its not version specific.I have my g700s plugged into my usb 3.o port without any issues at all.
can this be used on a mac?
The logitech software works on Mac. All functions work on Mac.
Does this have an on/off switch?
Yes it has in the down side
Dose this mouse have a "middle click", usually the action of pressing the mouse wheel down? The wheel has left/right, but dose it click down?
Yes, and it's just as audible as the left/right wheel clicks.
What is the difference between the inFamous: Second Son Limited Edition and the Standard Edition?
The limited edition comes with an extra couple missions and a exclusive jacket to be worn by the chracter. If the price is very different I would just buy the standard edition unless you really want those two missions.
if i bought a used copy of this game would i still be able to get all the limited editions features? or is it only redeemable once?
Only redeemable once
Tomb raider, this or watch dogs
INFAMOUS SECOND SON is an exclusive title that you must have as a PS4 owner. Watchdogs is also a good open world sandbox and its also fun too. Tomb raider is more of an adventure and action game. I have all of these titles, personally I choose watchdogs because it gives more play hours and it has a lot of fun extras games that you can play online.
is this infamous really the limited edition?
no I ordered the limited edition and got the Normal version no Code.
Is the limited edition worth it?
Yeah
I had the standard edition edition and beat it so I then sold it, so would it be smart to buy it again for the limited edition?
Almost the same the different is it has free extra mission
is this version an american-EEUU or american-canadian?
dont know
Is Infamous Second Son still factory sealed?
Well it came New (unopened) but I'm unsure what exactly you mean by Factory sealed
Is this game 3rd person only?
It is only 3rd person.
Can i play on my pc with this controller? Need a software?
It can be used to play on a PC but it does need special software. Try this address for software- http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-DS4-To-XInput-Wrapper
CAN BE THE PS4 CONTROLLER USED FOR PS3?
This can now be used wirelessly as of today! http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/02/ps4-controllers-now-work-wirelessly-with-ps3-consoles
Is the Micro USB charging port the same as the DS3?
no
Does it work for pc?
Yes, but you need to find another driver to completely support this controller on PC.
Why doesn't this come with a USB cable to charge it?
I believe the answer to that is to save on cost, and the fact that the PS4 and almost every other device nowadays comes with a USB cord. Personally, I just use my cell phone charger if I'm not using the usb cord that came with the PS4.
I see the blue controller is available Sept 9th, is the red coming too? I thought they both were...?
The red one is out but it looks like Amazon just fulfills it and not actually sells it. Plus, it is a bit more expensive than the rest of these controllers.
DOES DUAL SHOCK 4 WORK ON PS3 AND ON GTA 5
Are you asking if the DS4 will work playing GTA5 on the PS3? http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/02/ps4-controllers-now-work-wirelessly-with-ps3-consoles Good news! The DS4 now works on the PS3 wirelessly. I can only assume that it would work for GTA5 on the PS3 as well, but MAYBE some of the special features with the PS4 version won't work--like the light in the back of the DS4 reflecting the actions of the game. I'm not sure if that would work on the PS3, might, might not, don't know.
Are the sticks confortable to play with? Meaning it won't slide my thumbs by mistake like with the DS3?
I know what you mean with the DS3, that was so annoying. On the ps4 they did a great job fixing that. I've played for hours some days and the thumb sticks stay durable and also they are a lot more comfortable than the ps3. The whole remote is a step up.
Can this be charged with a microUSB phone charger (wall charger) or does it have to be plugged in through a usb?
Wait it does? So unlike the PS3 controller (which will ONLY charge from a charging dock or the console itself or a laptop left on 24/7), when my controller's running low I can plug it into my http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-SurgePlus-3-Outlet-Charger-Protector/dp/B00ATZJ5YS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1401067989&sr=8-3&keywords=belkin+wall+charger WHILE I play with the supplied charge cable (that came with the console)? :D EDIT: June 10th 2014: Well after getting the console, I can confirm that the controller WILL charge from a wall charger, however it HAS to be a 1 amp plug. That belkin one I listed above it 2.1 amp and it will NOT work on that or the other 3 2.1 amp wall chargers I have, and it will NOT work on the like 4 .5 amp chargers I have either. It will however work on my new phone and new portable Bluetooth speaker's wall chargers, which are both 1 Amp. I guess something in the controller won't kick in to charge unless it's receiving exactly 1 Amp. Of course needing to charge one from a wall socket near you while playing becomes a moot point once you get a charging stand and a 2nd controller to swap to.
If I play plugged in 24/7, will it shorten the battery life once I decided to disconnect and use the DS4 Controller wirelessly?
No it wont.. But if u didn't already know. The light bar uses about 80% of the power. So if it seems like ur battery is dyin faster it's because the battery is gettin old & it's time to invest in another controller. Cause the newer the controller the better the battery life... Hope this helps
Is this similar to the Kinnect for the Xbox? How or how not?
in some ways yes in others no. kinect has more voice commands. (for now) also in the future give or take a few years Sony will come out with a VR headset the works with the camera
Is this just an upgraded version of the Playstation Eye? I play the champions game, will this work better than the eye?
This camera is only for PS4. It has motion control with Move and DualShock 4 and works REALLY well. Has head tracking, facial recognition, and voice commands as well. It works much much better than the PS Eye. The only content for it right now is The Playroom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv5uI2vlXE8 Its great for showing your face when streaming games though.
does this have motion gaming like the kinect
SMH! Sadly there are not that many so far (Just Dance), it's useless in my opinion if all you can do as of the moment is use it in the playroom and Just Dance
Which the contents of the pack? Comes with the support?
Comes with a small swivel support, and is very easy to assemble
does this have motion gaming like the kinect
Yeah but limited, playstation doesnt really focus gaming around camera compared to xbox
Is there an extension cord for the camera available?
Not yet, I'm gonna need an extension too. My Ps4 is 10 feet from my TV. I'm gonna wait until there are better games before I purchase one.
Does the camera have the ability to record and store videos directly onto the ps4 hard drive?
Yes
Does the camera come with a mount? I've read and watched reviews and they show a mount included. I just want to make sure it comes with one or not.
Yes it does. It has thin articulated (hinged might be a better word) plates the same with of the camera (like the samsung tv cameras) that can be shaped as a stand or that supports the camera if placed on top of the TV
Can you olny use the playstation eye for 2k face skan, or can u use this as well
I assume you mean face scan technology for NBA 2K15, If so then yes you can use the playstation 4 camera for it
Is there any extention cable available ? The cable cannot reach the playstation. It is too short...
Idk if an extention cable is available. You might want to check with your local Game store or check online
would it work on European PS4 ?
Yes, it doesn't have any problems in Europe :)
Hello. How many players can play?
1 - 2 players
I have two dualshock 4 controllers. But I dont see an option in the game to play two player co-op. can you help me please?
Yes you can play 2 players on knack.
I&acute;ve got two kids. Can they play it together?
Yes. One can play as Knack and the other can play as the little side kick. I played it on super easy mode with my daughter and it was really fun. Not too hard or frustrating.
I have a PS4 and looking for games for my 5 year old son. Would he be able to play this if not do you suggestions?
I feel that it would be a good game for kids. It doesn't have any blood or gore. It's more along the lines of the old fashioned type video games.
does this edition support Korean and Chinese, too?
no it's english only
I'm 36 almost 37. Will I enjoy this game?
It depends. Knack is a difficult game that feels like it came out of the 80s or 90s. Knack has simple controls that are easy to learn but hard to master. It's the super Mario bros of beat'em ups. It's pretty bare bones, but it's really fun despite its jumbled story. If you just started gaming then you could at least do easy mode, but as someone who has been gaming all my life I found the game difficult. If you have ps+ I'd say wait. It is sure to be the first retail game on the service on ps4. If you want a challenge though, this is your game.
Good day, the game has the Spanish language.
Yes, the game itself is in Spanish and has subtitles S, el juego s est en espaol y tambin tiene subttulos
What type of game is this? Is there strategy involved?
It's a platformer. Not a whole lot of strategy. Think of Ratchet & Clank (without guns), or Jak & Daxter. If you liked those two, and you can excuse the overall simplicity of the game, it should be right up your ally.
how are the graphics
pretty much the best way to describe it is it is kind of like a pixar movie. I was impressed.

does this version include the crusader class
Unfortunately no, this new class is appearing in the expansion "The Reaper of Souls" . With a heavy metal salute (devil horns) play on my friend!
Can I continue where I left off in the demo if I buy the physical copy, or do I have to start all over again?
I believe you start over but i would be happy to help you level if you would like my email is jjjwhitefoot@gmail.com
Is it possible to play this game single play without being online and playing game with other people? I know I have to be online with this game which is absolutely ridiculous, but do I have to interact with real people? I play games to escape from real...
yes I play the game by my self but you do go on line but just pick play by your self and pick who you want to be. as always forever young god bless bobby lee 007
Does Diablo III on PS3 allow offline(Local) multiplay? In the other word, can 2 people play D3 on one PS3 at the same time?
Yes. There is a miltiplayer offline mode. U can play 4 players at the same time is really great
this version has spanish language?
From what I have read, Blizzard (who publish Diablo games), have region locked the languages to wherever you bought the game. So, the version bought in America has English only, the version bought in Spain or South America will have Spanish or Portugese.
is there a multiplayer mode
Yes, there is
Is it worth it to buy this if my sole intention is to play the campaign? Have no interest in KZ multiplayer.
It is worth it. I never played the multiplayer one bit. I only played the campaign and it was amazing. I have recently been thinking of getting it again to play thru again. but if your looking for an amazing campaign this game has it. I highly recommend it.
Is this just another graphical showcase like Ryse was for the X1 or is there an actual game hidden in here?
There is an actual storyline that makes sense. It gets pretty intense through the campaign and multiplayer is good once you figure out weapon combos
can you play off line as a single game or is it just multiplay mode. do i need to buy playstation plus?
You can play offline in single player compaign. Multiplayer mode can only be played online.
Does it come with a redeemable code that I need, or need to play online?
You pay for a code redeem to download the game from playstore. After that you can play campaign and play on line if you are a psn plus user.
Is the game a disc or just a digital download
I know is that this only disc
is this game a mutil-language pack of both Chinese and Korean Edtion?
If you buy NTSC/USA version, NO. It's only English/French.
Can 2 people play this game with 2 controllers on one console in co-op mode? If yes and is not too much trouble, please explain how to do that.
unfortunately there is no co-op mode. You can play online matches with other players but not anything local or split screen.
Is there a co-op mode? In other words, can two players play this game locally?
Not for the main story/campaign.
Do I need internet connection even to play single player mode?
Yes
is this game couch co op?
No
Is this game FPS?
No, it's a Third-Person Shooter.
Does this game come with two disc?
Yes it does come with 2 discs
As a mom I am asking... My son is 11. He has a couple of the call of duty games. What do you think? Can he avoid the sex stuff in "free roam"?
I did not know there was any sex related stuff in the free roam. My question to you is, you let him play a game where the point of the game is to "kill" the opponent but a little naked behind is not ok. Sounds a bit skewed doesn't it??
How many gigs is this game and can I install it to a flash drive?
its on 2 disks....you have to store the installation disk (disk 1) completely on the Hard Drive to play (you need atleast 5-7 GB of space). I would not recommend a flash drive.
Will the NTSC thing work in my PAL Xbox system?
The watchdog game i got is NTSC whereas i get my games in PAL mode. Watchdog runs perfectly well on my system
Is This a Digital Download Code ? I don't want media, just code to download from Live.
No
Do you have to have Xbox Live to play this game?
Not for single player. Muliplayer online needs xbox live.
can you block the sexual situations like you can on some m games
No
This game has subtitles in Spanish?
No
My bf likes Assasins creed, gta5, red dead redemption, kinda COD, would he like this?
I'm just like your bf and I love those games as well. I think he would like this game because its similar to those games mentioned. He'll like the game but he wont love it

I am having trouble getting this expansion pack to run on my mac. Can you offer any assistance?
I don't think EA is interested in helping anyone who uses a Mac. I had a Mac and could not play with Pets because of the horse issue, which to my knowledge still isn't fixed. They make the greatest games on earth, but they're glitchy, buggy, and don't work right half the time. I will not be buying Sims 4 either.
I just downloaded sims 3 Island paradise but I cannot run it because it says I need to download Sims 3 first. Does any one know if this is the case?
I brought this for my Granddaughter, but I do believe you need the first one since it is called an expansion pack, sounds like it expands the original version. Elizabeth
if i purchase this game not the (downloa part) but the pc/mac part (which means that i receive cd at home, will i receive an origincode emailed
When we got the cd it had an activation code on a card inside the box. You can use the code on origin to register and play through an origin account.
is the pc/mac version be used for mac and pc, is that what this means? or only the mac version be only for mac
It can be used for both.
I have multiple laptops. Can I work this on both laptops at the same time for both my kids?
Yes
When you 1st get into town do they show how to play it, or you have to know it from the other games?
My daughter said you can use the tutorials to get familiar with the game.
Whne you 1st get into town, do they show you how to play it, like how to pause it and how to go to the menu? or you have to know it from the other sim
Yes they do show the instructions on how to play the game...
Do you have any problems with the Electronic Arts and Origin mix. Crashes, freezing or anything like that with this Sims game?
No, I do not have problems with freezing or anything like that with the Sims 3 game. You might need to download the latest update.
Do you need sims 3 to play expansion packs
Yes. However, be wary of Island Paradise. It freezes often and you have to reset the Sim every time.
Seems like my copy is glitchy-it is freezing temporally (a minute or less before going back to normal). I have supernatural EP and never had a problem until installing this game. Has anyone found a solution?
I have I just uninstalled it and try it again if that doesn't work then just uninstall it for good they had this problem since '11 and they still didn't fix it yet . Hope that helps
I am having trouble getting this expansion pack to run on my mac. Can you offer any assistance?
I don't think EA is interested in helping anyone who uses a Mac. I had a Mac and could not play with Pets because of the horse issue, which to my knowledge still isn't fixed. They make the greatest games on earth, but they're glitchy, buggy, and don't work right half the time. I will not be buying Sims 4 either.
I just downloaded sims 3 Island paradise but I cannot run it because it says I need to download Sims 3 first. Does any one know if this is the case?
I brought this for my Granddaughter, but I do believe you need the first one since it is called an expansion pack, sounds like it expands the original version. Elizabeth
if i purchase this game not the (downloa part) but the pc/mac part (which means that i receive cd at home, will i receive an origincode emailed
When we got the cd it had an activation code on a card inside the box. You can use the code on origin to register and play through an origin account.
is the pc/mac version be used for mac and pc, is that what this means? or only the mac version be only for mac
It can be used for both.
I have multiple laptops. Can I work this on both laptops at the same time for both my kids?
Yes
When you 1st get into town do they show how to play it, or you have to know it from the other games?
My daughter said you can use the tutorials to get familiar with the game.
Whne you 1st get into town, do they show you how to play it, like how to pause it and how to go to the menu? or you have to know it from the other sim
Yes they do show the instructions on how to play the game...
Do you have any problems with the Electronic Arts and Origin mix. Crashes, freezing or anything like that with this Sims game?
No, I do not have problems with freezing or anything like that with the Sims 3 game. You might need to download the latest update.
Do you need sims 3 to play expansion packs
Yes. However, be wary of Island Paradise. It freezes often and you have to reset the Sim every time.

how do i get the 60 min of gameplay
The cover (in the case) of the game has a code. You need to input that code in redeem code either on the PSN store or the game menu. The content is not added by default, but available only to those who purchase a new copy of the game or are lucky enough that the previous owner did not use the code. The missions you should get are CTRL, ALT, DELETE, and SHUT DOWN. These are sequential so don't be surprised if you only see one.
is this for a single player to.
Yes this is for single player
Why was The Signature Shot Pack not included in my copy?
what copy did u get?
how many offline players can play at time?
only one player offline, there is no offline multiplayer.
can i choose chinese in language setting?
I'm sorry but Chinese does not appear to be one of the options. I had my son check.
Ps3 game freezes exchanged got another one and just froze up on me the first time with this copy. Anyone else have this problem?
No
i got a used copy theres no scrathes but wen i play the gamplay is very silent only wen i drive i hear car i meen i turn the sound up it so silent
As far as I know, (I don't play this game, but I did test it out) it is fairly quiet. The one section I tested had a guy walking around. Faint footsteps, no background noises (ie: traffic sounds, etc) There is a set-up menu though. Check that to see if there are 'other settings', they may have included a section to tweak sounds. Sorry I could not be more helpful.
Is the game worth it to buy it new, or is used a better deal? Also, does it have any istallation issues?
Hi Julian, I bought my new for two reasons first the new cost about as much as a used one and second if u buy new u are getting a warrenty I had no probs w/ the installation it's fast and simple
I havnt got this game for my son yet and he wants to know if it's worth it
The game is cool, worth every penny

does this charger have smart charging?
If you mean that It will stop when charging is done, the answer is yes.
Will the Wii pad still fit if it has a silicon jacket/protector on? Thank you!
No
Does this device come with the chargeable backs to the Wii remotes, and how many Wii remotes does it carry?
Yes it has all you need to recharge 2 Wii remotes.
What is the mah rating on the batteries for the Wiimotes? Or if that isn't listed anywhere how do they compare with a regular set of AAs?
Hi. You cannot compare with a regular set of AAs. Constant gameplay time is 4h maybe more if you turn off the vibrations on the wiimote.
Compatible with Will U Remote Plus or the old Wii Remote Controller?
Yeah it is compatible with both the remote plus and the regular/old one.
four batteries?! two for each remote?! or just two batteries for one remote?!
There is only one battery for each Wii mote that it can charge. So two batteries total
will this charge the nokio pro commander controller?
Unfortunately, it does not. Basically the charging port is only made for an exact perfect fit for a regularly licensed Nintendo Pro Controller. I have not found a third party one that will fit. I own the Afterglow and Nyko versions as well. You may want to look around at Toys R US, they have 90% clearance on the Nyko Controller docking station with I believe fits it.
dose this have a console ??
Not sure what you mean...but I love this quad recharger...easy to use and very very helpful....can charge the large controller that comes with the WiiU, and the Pro-Controllers...also the smaller controllers (the quad will charge 2 at a time)...I enjoy so much I'm going to purchase another...has a sound base that it sits on...is very steady...hope this answer helps you if not let me know....AHFerret
Does the dock charge a mini controller?
Mini controller? Not sure what is meant here, but it charges 2x wiimotes, a Wii u gamepad, and a pro controller simultaneously. Hope this helps
will this charge the nyko pro commander controller?
I've never used it with a 3rd party remote but I see no reason why it wouldn't. If you're concerned with compatability, I did see that Nyko makes their own charger base, but only with 2 slots. But the other one should work fine. (Don't take my word as 100% gospel; just personal opinion.) Hope this helps!

Is this mechanical?
No
How is the size compared to say a logictech G15? i like the larger surface area of keys instead of having them crammed together will this be similar?
The Steelseries Apex RAW Gaming Keyboard is slightly larger than the Logictech G15. the logictech G15 is 20.2 x 8.8 x 1.9 inches, while the SteelSeries Apex RAW Gaming Keyboard is around 20.5 x 8.7 x 2 inches but with the keys overall, it is quite spacey In my opinion, and my hands are never lost when I use it for my games that I play.
Can the macro keys activate AutoHotKey scripts?
Absolutely. They can run any file that you link. Just link the script and it works, no problems. I've done this myself :D
Is this keyboard wireless or wired?
It's wired.
Are the macros saved onto the keyboard? i.e. if I move my keyboard to another computer (that already has ss software), will my custom macros work?
Of what I know, they do save. But I haven't moved this keyboard so I really don't know. The reason I think it would save is because of profiles.
I hit the space bar and it double space. Any fix for this? Thanks
Generally have to peel the key off gently and clean the area. If it's under warranty I'd do so first. Breaking it will void the warranty
How does this thing handle dust, Are there any piano glossy black parts? If so I'm not buying it because I live in an EXTREMELY dusty area
I haven't had any problems with dust affecting the functionality, but it's black, and it has gloss black parts, so it shows dust. Any dust.
Approximately how long is the cord?
Approximately 3 ft. I don't have a tape measure handy, so +/-3 inches.
Is the space bar much louder than any other key?
The space bar is louder but still very quiet compared to a mechanical keyboard
volume adjustment
On the RAW, there are no volume/play back buttons.
are you able to switch fans off with this and is it possible to run 2 of these in the same build?
Yes to both questions.
Will this work with the Cooler Master Jetflo 120mm fans? They are PWM fans
Yes
I've got some 2 wire fans that don't register on the controller. Only three wire fans are recognized. Does anyone else have this problem?
Three wire fans have pwm (pulse width modulation), which means there voltage can be controlled digitally. Two wire fans just have positive and negative inputs
Are the blue LED's brighter than the picture, or are they really that dull blue?
They're not blue at all... They are actually white. I wouldn't trust these controllers. I have 2 and both change from auto to manual controls at random.
What's the warrenty on this?
You have the manufacturing warranty only. One year.
is this a 30v 20 v or 10v?
this is 12v, connected to the PSU
Just purchased this unit. My specifications on the product packaging state 30w/channel. What do yours say? On your product packaging? Revision?
My BitFenix Recon (BFA-RCN-KS-RP) product box says 15W Max Watts / Channel. Doesn't have a Rev. #
Is it a 2 or 3 pin fan controller?
3
Is this a ps4 game? Is there any violence in it or is it just about training gaurd dogs? I enjoy training dogs so this looks fun.
As B. Tipton said, no violence and you will learn how to train all breeds of dogs. There is exciting DLC that features Cesar Millan, and you work beside him on 3 intense levels where you try to get this Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever and Treeing Walker Coonhound to not fight while company is over.
Will the single-player gameplay be significantly diminished if you don't have a reliable internet connection?
A couple articles have mentioned there may be some disadvantages to not playing online. When choosing to play offline, a window pops up with the following: "By disabling Online Invasions you will not be available for other players to invade, but you will also not be able to participate in Online Hacking and Tailing. Your Notoriety will be reset to 0 and any Notoriety Skills you have unlocked will be lost."

PS3 &amp; PS4 version cross-play compatible?
No there is no cross gen play
I'm curious if Watch Dogs is meant to be 21st Century Assassin's Creed? Is the play-style similar to Assassin's Creed?
The parkore and player movements give it a Assassins creed feel. Like hurdling over obstacles looks and feels a lot like AC. However the shooting and driving give it a entirely different feeling. Some of the side missions feel like Some AC side missions. Tailing enemies, stealing data - listening in on conversations in AC, linking with CTOS - eagle viewpoints in AC. It has some AC feel but a different feel of something new
Pre-order bonus Question : So for the PS4 version, if I pre-order from Amazon, do I get both pre-order bonuses? The Signature Shot Pack from Amazon, and the PS4 exclusive (60min additional game play plus extra battery slot) bonus as well, or is it only...
It's not a PS 4 exclusive, that 1 hour of content is a Playstation exclusive. Look at the case covers for both the PS3 and PS4 versions, they could've worded that better, as in Playstation instead of PS3 or PS4. Both versions get it (and it's not a pre order bonus), Xbox or PC doesn't.
I was under the impression that games would be able to be delivered to arrive by the release date. Is this correct?
I pre-ordered mine, it's on the UPS truck, and scheduled to deliver on the 27th, as promised.
is blue ray DVD? or to download the code for psn?
Blu Ray dvd
Does this game come with one of those activation code papers inside? I'm considering a used copy.
New copies come with activation papers on the inside cover of the game, I'm not sure if a used copy would have a code that has not been used
If I buy a pre-owned version for PS4 do I need to also buy a pass to play? I'm attempting to avoid giving UPlaysoft any of my money.
there is no pass needed to play the game i think you may need a PS plus sub to play online but thats all (: season pass is optional for DLC
How do you get on the multiplayer free roam where there are other players? (on PS4)
Once you get to the 3rd (I think) mission it unlocks multiplayer. From there you can open the map and switch to the multiplayer map where you choose what you want to do.

The new ps vita slim model fits well in this case????
My slim does not fit in this case. I think if I pushed real hard i could get it in there but not going to do that. I may do a little cutting to make room as it is a great case.
why do half of the people say the vita 2000 fits, and the other half say it doesn't?
I think it's because people have differences in opinions on the words "fits" and "comfortably". I'd also go so far as to say that these people don't take care of their systems properly. If you have to push your Vita in the case hard, and you have to use something to pry it out, that is NOT a comfortable fit. All of these people stating that the Vita 2000 model "fits" in this case are WRONG, and are putting their Vita in danger by putting pressure on it like that. This case is for the older model, simply put. These positive reviews from Vita Slim owners are confusing people, forcing them to buy it for themselves, only to be disappointed.
it is good protection but i afriad it will make damage or breaking ps slim or not because it is very very fit to push push and push even take off also
It's made only for the first ps vita model. Not psp slim or ps vita slim
It's been about 2 years since it was released. Can it now fit the PS Vita Slim comfortably or do you still have to push on it hard?
If you have your PS vita without any protector, it fits perfectly. Yoou can have a screen protector but no more than that. At least in my experience
soooo, my new Vita Slim PCH-2001 won't fit in this case? Thanks.
No. It wont fit
is this water proof
Yes
How many game cards can this case hold?
4
How far back does the case open? Can it only open to the degrees shown in the picture or does it extends further?
180 degrees. You won't be able to play in the case either. But I've dropped mine a couple times on asphalt and it's done great.
Can you put the vita in the case along with the trigger grip on it, I bought the sony PS Vita trigger grip.
No, just the Vita.
Will this case get re-developed for the slim model?
Yes it will. The slimmer model may fit will a little space because the original fits too snug. But they will redesign.
does it have an original HDMI Cable as well ?
no recuerdo creo que si la trae
Does the PS3 250GB Slim console come with the 1 Year Sony manufacturer warranty?
Yes
Is this the PS3 Slim (2nd generation PS3) or the PS3 Super Slim console (3rd generation PS3)?
Super slim
is it 100-240 input voltage??
Yes, your power supply is universal, 100-240V. You just need the right power cord.
does the playstation 3 console works with 3D format?
Yes
Does this bundle have everything needed to play regular ps 3 games. Not just move games. Or do I need another console?
Yes it plays all ps3 games it also plays movies including blue rays
does this version play Madden 25 and NCAA 14?
If Jeff says so, it must be true. Unless Steven says otherwise ;) Woz can provide third party verification along with Morito San. That's about as much as I can tell you for now. Sorry :(
Good day. Does it include also the original PlayStation controller?
Yes it does, just one however
Has Perixx addressed and fixed the liftoff distance, or still a problem with this mouse? It has been marked down a few times which raises concerns.
I haven't had an issue with that personally. That is only going to be an issue if you don't maximize the mouses potential at a higher dpi setting anyways. I usually have right in the middle which I believe is 4200dpi? Anyways one of the best mice I have ever owned especially for the price. Haven't had a single issue with it
does it need batteries? Mine just "Went off" and I don't know what to do
It does not take batteries. If its not responding its most likely that either the mouse itself is broken or that there as an issue with the USB port or PC
Do the mouse LEDs turn off when the computer goes to sleep/turns off?
Yes
Can you customize the +/- buttons for the right thumb? I want them to be customized for certain actions during games, is it possible?
Yes, you can give every button on the mouse programmable commands
The scroll wheel won't scroll back, is there any way to fix that?
Mine stopped working about 2 weeks after I got it; so I had to return the mouse. :\
When someone asks if it's compatible with macs we want to know if the software works with macs to program the buttons?.
Yo I have a bootcamped computer, when i went to use the mouse on my MAC the software is NOT compatible with MAcs. So you can use the mouse but program nothing, other than what is connected to the mouse through the mouse option in the MAc settings.
Can the DPI buttons (+/-) be remappped, such as making them +/- zeroing for a scope?
Yes, Just download the software for the mouse and you can change the "+/-" into whatever action you would like. I've done the same on Battlefield and it works great.
do the colors cycle through -or fade into each diff color automaticly with a setting
The colors are static; you have to change between different colors through the control panel software packaged with the mouse. You can set the frequency at which a color pulses.
Is this mouse compatible with Macs?
Yes.. I think all mice are compatible with all Operating Systems.
is the sexual content strong in this game or mild,
Mild. There is very little sexual content. But the game is full of assassinations...
So, to clarify, this has online gaming with friends, right?
Yes. Also there are achievements and missions that can only be completed online.
For my game once i get to a certain point it keeps going to the pause menu and wont go out of it. Does anyone know how to fix it?
I've never had that happen, but I've had some other strange problems. So far they have all been fixed by rebooting the game player. To do this, hold down the power button on the wii u control pad as if you're turning it off. However, you'll need to hold the button down long enough that the screen goes black before you let go. Wait at least two or three minutes before turning the wii u on again. As another option, you could start a second game and see if you experience the same glitch. If you still have problems, I suggest you contact the software company.
I have read that this gameon PS3 can be made to have less blood and language by using parental controls settings. Is this true also on Wii U?
I have found no parental controls. In the options, under the video heading, there is a a place to turn the blood on or off. When the blood option is off, you still hear the sound of your weapon and your target still makes some disturbing gurgling noises and writhes in pain. By "language, I assume you mean adult language. I haven't seen an option to adjust adult language. You could turn the voice volume to zero, or the language option to French or Spanish, but you would miss some necessary dialog along with a very few "F" bombs.
Why is this so cheap? isn't supposed to cost $59.99?
there is a major sale going on , so the price is no longer 59;99. thank you.
is it 1080p?
Yeah. It looks great.
can i play with the wii plus control like a sword?? i mean if i have to move like if i were figthing??
i havent tryed, but i think you can't. i will try to day.
how many people can play at the same time? does it support the wii remote plus control? is t necesary the nunchuk controller??
This is a single player game. There is multiplayer for online only. It supports the gamepad & classic controller pro.
I ask for the idiom, is multilanguage?
I don't think mine is multilanguage but I haven't looked.
Is PAL version?
No, my disc specifically says for the Americas only, so presumably this is NTSC.
is this game fun? how long is the campaign? is the multiplayer cool?
Its amazing. However the campaign is short compared to some of the other games and. The ending kind of sneaks up on you so for that reason I don't like the story arc as much as the other games but overall it's a great game. the multiplayer hasn't changed much and as always it's worth playing.
Could I free roam this open world map? Like for ex: Skyrim. Or is this a sand box map, ex: Dishonored? Thank you
Yes and no. If you ever played AC games things are blocked off until you finish missions same goes here but there's a lot of exploring to do and collectibles. The good news is after you get your ship and can customize it you can free roam about 90% of the game (hunt for buried treasure, underwater wrecks, hunt animals and get into naval battles). Its not exactly open world like Skyrim.
What kind of gameplay should I expect from this?
If you are familiar with the series then you will have a pretty good idea. Combat mechanics have not changed much. Its a little more fluent. Better weapon selections. As well as armors. Naval combat and exploration is a much improvement over its previous release of AC3. All in all a great buy. If your interested in trophies/achievements there is a lil more of a challenge. I was able to get the platinum trophies on all previous games fairly easy on one play threw. This one took me atleast 2 to obtain all including the platinum.
Do I need internet connection to play this in single player mode?Thanks in advance
No
Can I play the PS4 version using my PS3 save games? Just upgraded to PS4 and don't want to start game over.
No you can't continue on a new console
Are there many sessions going on in MP in general? And how is the support? MP in the PS3 version is dismal at best.
Pretty much the same. I really don't think 3rd person mp can exist in an industry of fps shooters. If it was like gta's mp. I'm sure they'd be better off. Co-op would be a better choice. Mp matches in ac is dismal as well. Hopefully this answers your question
Is it similar to Assassin Creed Unity ? I just finished that find it's fun, not sure if I should buy this too
It's a much better game. But the graphics still look PS3. This is probably the best game in the series after 3.
Is there a big difference in the PS3 and PS4 four versions?
Game play no, graphics yes.
what is the region ?
the Bahamas
I played AS3 It was my first AS game. I loved every thing about it, it litterly amezed me. I Played it on Wii U. do you recommend BF on PS4 or Wii U?
Ps4 is the most recommended, the WII U does not support high graphical games
ITs in spanish?
By default the spoken language is English but you can change it to Spanish, French, or Portuguese on the options .
I'm living in Singapore(asia).Can I play online(multiplayer) and download the DLCs with my asia account or must I set up US psn account?
Psn codes are region sensitive, so you have to have a psn account of the same region of the amazon you get your code from, so form this one you do need a us psn account.
The game is in English or multi language? has any subtitles at least? Which? El juego esta en ingl&eacute;s o tiene m&uacute;ltiples idiomas o subtitulos ? Cuales?
The game is in multi language subtitles also you can read it and hear it while the character speak I use most Spanish

I do not know, bought for someone else
My son is 12 years old and really wants to get this game. Is this game appropriate for his age? Should I wait a year or two? What say you???
I dont think so since this game have violence (guns, swords) and you have/can to murder people...I will not considered for a 12 years old kid.
I played the first assassins creed and stopped because it was so repetitious. Are the later assassins creed games the same way?
My son says the later games are less repetitious and more fleshed out. Hope that helps.
Does the frame rate drop tremendously when in major cities for anyone else. I have a super slim ps3
I too have a suoer slim 500 gb. Playstation 3. I rarely encountered any framerate issues. a couple of times when things got really crazy but not enough to take away from the fun I had playing the game.
the game can change language? There Spanish?
Yes, there is spanish audio and subtitles
i just got this for my windows 8 toshiba and it is lagging so bad that i cant even get through the tutorial. how can i fix it?
Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements. Check to see if you're in power saving mode. Turn off unnecessary programs using your ram. Turn down game graphics.
Does this work at all with windows 8?
It should work just fine on Windows 8. Back of the box says vista/7/8.
can you play the pc version with a 360 controller?
I have a 360 controller running on a Windows 8 machine that was automatically detected as soon as I plugged it into the USB port (it's wired, not wireless). I didn't need to do anything special after installing AC4. When the game first started up and said, "Press any key", I pressed A on the controller and it worked straight away. No button configuring required.
Can I buy the DLC later and have it work with this version?
Yes, just like every other game :)
will this work flawlessly with windows 8.1 and a gamepad?
Absolutely...I have windows 8.1 and work perfectly...
I bought this game and I can not play , I get it already been registered before. I could say I go to play ?
Are you sure that the problem come from the key? It's hard to tell without information how you cannot play. I have problem as well, first I cannot install the game because the disc has some scratches so I try the steam version instead. After I play for a while, my computer got update and I cannot start the game, so I change the graphic setting and it work just fine. If your problem is similar to mine, I suggest changing the game setting to minimum requirement and try to start the game. Hope this help.
is this a steam activation code or uplay?
Uplay
do you have to have internet
Not obligatory, just you can play without conection but if you conect to internet can unblock some facilities.
Why is game in slooow motion and video is like watching old kung fu movies?
That is not normal. Does your PC meet the minimum requirements? If your graphics card and cpu aren't that great, you might wanna lower the graphics settings before playing.
online multi player training works good but regular game play is slooooow motion whats wrong?
We don't play it online, but sometimes it is really slow. Sorry, I don't have a clue. Perhaps your internet speed slowed down? Good luck finding the answer.
Is this ok for a 13 year old? I'm not too concerned with blood or fighting...mostly wondering about language or nudity/sexual content
Yea it's ok it's very rare for it to have sexual or language scenes plus it shows historical events of the pirate era
Do you need xbox live membership to play it on your own? Like to play without xbox live.
You can play through the entire single-player campaign without an Xbox live account or membership
Just out of curiosity, did Edward ever become an Bonafide(real) assassin or is he just wearing the hood?
He does indeed become an Assassin throughout the game he was just a pirate but he grows up and ends up living by a creed instead of living by his own selfish desires
Is there a significant graphical difference between Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions of this game? I am going to upgrade to Xbox One in a few months. I was wondering if I should buy Black Flag on 360 and Unity for Xbox One or get both for Xbox One in a...
I had the opportunity to compare and I think the difference is plotted on XBOX ONE minimally higher compared to XBOX 360. Assassins Creed IV Black Flag is not yet XBOX ONE which should be an eighth generation video game.
The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?? El juego viene en multilenguaje? lo quiero en espa&ntilde;ol
Yes it does
What languages are available with this game? Is there French or Spanish audio (audio, NOT subtitles) available? Thanks!

Yes

It takes up 1.10Gb of space.
does it have any downloadable content?
No it had no downloadable content the first disk is the game and the second disk it to show you how to play it's a great game

There is a multi-player option, yet I have not tried it yet.
Is this item only for the original Xbox or is it compatible with the Xbox 360?
Only the original xbox
How long is the cord, and does it have an extenion to the cord to plug into xbox? &amp; What is the warrenty?
The cord is shorter than the original. At about 6 feet, it's too short for most couch configurations, and there is no extension. Not sure about the warranty, but I ordered 2 and I had to send one back because it was DOA. These are cheaply made, but hey, what do you expect for $8.
how long is the cord?
about 6 feet
Is this the official Xbox controller S (made by microsoft)?
No, they aren't, and mine already broke, so the quality is questionable as well.
Does the PC version on disc also come with a steam code? I'm guessing no because of UPlay but figured wouldn't hurt to ask. Thx! :)
I have the retail version, and it is for Uplay only.
what does the box contains
Installation DVD's and a flyer with the activation code
will the game be installed on steam or at least will you be allowed you to play without the disc ?
You don't need the disk.. and its u play instead of steam! You install it with the disk and after you should not need the disk.
Is Uplay required or steam? i hope steam!
Hello Belinda, this game when you get it and install it forces you to use Uplay to install it again pretty much. If you want it on Steam you have to buy it in the Steam store, however it will still force you to install on Uplay. Hope this helped!
What are the bare minimum PC system requirements?
The bare minimum pc system are ram 4g, windown 7, video card 1g, hard driver 10g
My husband really likes this game. Can someone please suggest a couple of other games that are similar? I'm Christmas shopping.
Assassins creed games, GTA5 (not out yet on PC), just cause 2 (kind of similar)
what is the meaning of online in the top of the box
It means you can play online against other players but you must setup a free account to play online.
will it work on windows vista?
Yes but... It needs to be SP2 64bit and If you're running vista, you likely have an old graphics card. This needs a pretty good card. Read the specs before buying otherwise it won't run and most sellers don't accept returns on PC games.
cn you play this game with an xbox 360/pc controller
Yes, absolutely. This video shows someone playing watch dogs on pc with an xbox one controller and compares it to his experience using an xbox 360 controller on the same game
Is the goods use a cd-rom to install or download online?
I haven't bought a cd rom since 2007. If I was you I would download it

Is the goods use a cd-rom to install or download online?
I haven't bought a cd rom since 2007. If I was you I would download it
are there black people?
....
does this have the greek states as playable factions?
Nope but some faction in greek culture can be playable
how do i patch the pc version?
Look into piratebay or isohunt also because the game is newer you might have to wait for the patch to come out on pc rather than steam
is this a good game to get
Yes it is! The best computer game I have ever played! I have been playing computer games for 18 years!
if i get the rome 2 (not the emperor edition) does it automatically come with campaign from the emperor edition and factions??
I believe so...I have the emperor edition and I think all it offers is a campaign that is more historical.
if i buy Total War: Rome 2 will the Imperator Augustus be add or do i have to buy Total War: Rome II - Emperor's Edition to get it ?
It says that its not on steam, but isn't that the mode where you are rome in three different areas?
i have a windows 7 home premium 64 bit, amd E-300 dual core processor,amd radeon hd 6310 graphics card,500 gb harddrive will i be able to run this?
Yes. You will be able to run the game with those specifications. Although, I do recommend having 4GB or more (8GB ideal) of DDR3 memory to have the game run more smoothly on higher graphics settings.
If I don't have a disc drive and I get the disc version, does it come with a steam activation code in the case so I don't need to use the disc?
Steam activation codes and physical copies are two different things so if you want a steam code you should buy one that specifically states that. Thank you for your inquire.
does this work on mac?
Probably not, Mac is a kinda odd is for pc games, and this says pc on the case, not Mac
if u buy the download can you download it to more than one pc?
well if u want to waste ur money, it might but, my it guy that does repair said that this program is a pc killr of drive space
does this product have a warranty?
Ships from China, I doubt there is any warranty. Mine lasted about a week. Then the mouse would no longer communicate with the bluetooth USB port.
What are the buttons on the side of the mouse for and how do I program them? I would read the instructions... but I don't speak japaneese
I don't remember where I got the driver but I downloaded a zip file. With it there is a button for it on the bottom right row of buttons. Clicking on it brings up a window with a picture of the mouse with each of the mouse's buttons identified. You can program the buttons for any of the functions that are supported or you can disable buttons.
Does it work with an Apple computer?
Yes
How big is the USB dongle?
It's a usb 3.0 so it fits most if not all computer ports
Will this work for Super Smash Bros for the Wii U?
Yes but it will not play exactly like a GameCube Controller would. This adapter causes the Wii U to recognize the controller as a Classic Controller, and some liberties had to be taken in order to make this happen. For example, the shoulder buttons on the Cube Controller are pressure sensitive and the Classic Controller's are not, so this adapter will not read the degree of pressure you're putting on the shoulder buttons. You have to press the GameCube Controller's shoulder buttons all the way down in order for the console to recognize it as a button press. For a more faithful and high quality adapter, I recommend the official adapter (the one with four Controller ports that plugs into the Wii U's USBs). I own both and after using the official one, I'm never going back to using the Mayflash one.
Does this work with the Wireless Wavebird controller? I've seen some ppl say yes, others say no. If you have TRIED YOURSELF, let me know the answer.
I have done this and yes it does work, but I notice that the adapter for the wave bird tends to fall out. So it does work as long as it stays in.
Does anyone know how well this works for competitive Project M players?
Not great. Granted I have a cheap controller. My experience was that it randomly drops inputs. You'll hit a shoulder button or even jump and it wouldn't register leading to you falling to your doom like an idiot. Just wait for the official Nintendo adapter.
If I buy multiple adapters and plug them all into Wii motes, can me and some friends play brawl simultaneously at the same time?
Yes you should be able to, you just need a GC controller for each adaptar
I just got a game with a DANCE MAT, and I want to make sure I am able to connect it to my Wii U. Will this work as well?
I think it's important to remember that the Wii U is not designed to read any GameCube Controller you plug into this adapter (dance mat or otherwise) as an actual GameCube Controller. Instead, this adapter makes the Wii U read GameCube Controllers as if they were Wii Classic Controllers. As far as I know, that's its only function. So if your dance mat has a GameCube plug, AND if the game itself USES the Wii Classic Controller as a control scheme (meaning the game allows you to play songs or do dances with the Classic Controller alone), then it's possible it could work. But I'm not familiar with any game that has that function.
I cannot get the turbo light to stop blinking. This device is useless in Wii U mode. Tried tapping the button twice to erase settings but it wont?
Honestly, the device is wonky sometimes and typically takes a minute to work. Afterwards it'll work without a hitch, though!
will this work on wii mini for outdoor challenge?
No it doesn't. At least I couldn't figure out how to get it to work. I bought this for that particular game and ended up disappointed.
Why does my start button not work when i use this to play super smash bros brawl? Neither the start button on the gamecube controller or the + button.
Double tap start button for proceeding and hold start button for home menu
Will this work while playing Project M?
It works in any situation where you can use the classic controller. So if you can use the classic controller to play Project M, this will work for you.
How many controllers can plug into the adapter
only 1. But dont buy this if you dont own a Wii remote control. It will not connect directly to a Wii U, which is why I had to return mine. False advertisement, and waste of time.

Will it fit a small tablet like a Nexus 7?
Unfortunately no, I have two 5 inch phones it fits perfectly ( galaxy s4 and nexus 5) it will fit anything smaller and maybe even a galaxy note but I have a nexus 7 and it won't fit across the width. Although the controller works great not physically attached to any computer or tablet none the less
I have a Moto G. It's compatible? Does it have to be rooted?
I have a moto x and it works, so it should work. My phone is not rooted
how does it work with ipod touch
it can pair with the ipod but some games gets updated then they dont work will
can the galaxy s5 fit in this gamepad?
I would like to say yes because the gs5 is only marginally wider than the lg g2 (which i use) and i know for a fact that the clamp stretches further than my phones width.
the galaxy note 3 fit on the controler?
I know it fits the Note 2 and i didn't think the 3 was much wider so I'd guess it's gonna be close. If you measure how wide the 3 is you can find out though. The ipega goes just below (maybe 1/32" less than) 3 3/4". I think this thing MIGHT even fit the galaxy mega to tell you the truth.
Will it fit my Droid Turbo 3.6" wide Phone?
With my Galaxy S5 width at 2.85 inches it looks like there's just about another inch of space for a bigger phone.
I have a samsung tab 4, 7 inch tablet, I know it won't fit, but will it work for that?
I don't see why not. As long as your tablet has blue tooth it should work.
how do i connect it to my phone
Push x then home once the light stops blinking its connected
does it work with all android games
No
It works in nintendo emulator?
Yes
Is the Japanese 3DS compatible with an American 3DS charger?
Yes. That's what I am using now.
Is this has English as system language?
No
does this product comes with a charger?
No it does not
is the LL the newest one? and do you have the box for it?
The LL is the Japanese name of our 3ds XL (same size as the American 3dsXL). Yes I still have the box for it. When I had gotten my new 3ds it did not come with a charger (I believe it is stated that it wouldn't in the product description) however any American 3ds charger will work for it. Also just as a warning any 3ds game that you want to play have to be from the Japanese region ds games should be fine from any region though. Hope that helps. Feel free to contact me again if you have any other questions.
is the LL have the same size of game cards as Xl?
Yes

Can you tell me what is the installed system version?
I checked in settings and on the bottom right it says Ver. 7.2.0-17J
Why does this not work with American games?
Because that stupid Nintendo has region lock on all their game consoles. That means different region console can only play that region version games.

Will it make me have a faster trigger finger then now? People say I have a mod?
For me it made my trigger finger faster it just takes time getting used to. Yes it's some what of a mod but the pro's use them
does it make you have a really fast trigger finger in cod black ops 2
Yes it does it works for every call of duty
in the halo games you cant charge your weapon. Do you know how to fix it?
There isn't much you can do if you want to keep the trigger stop in, but an alternative could be to take the trigger stop out of that trigger only, which would still allow you to use it on the other trigger.
does it make you have a really fast trigger finger in cod black ops 2
Yes, it's the fastest way that you can't get banned for. The only thing faster is electronic mods which aren't allowed and you can get banned for.

I personally have used this extension Plugable 10 Meter (32 Foot) USB 2.0 Active Extension Cable Type A Male to A Female http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AGX4YO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It is possible you may need a powered USB hub at the end of the extension but I did not. I have used it for a Logitech unifying receiver and this controller module. This specific extension cable is amplified. It may not work with a webcam or other higher-power peripherals but you should be good to go.
Would this work with a chromebook?
Microsoft does not offer a driver for the chromebook, so ultimately no. You may be able to find a 3rd party driver that could force it to work however that can be risky.
Will this work with Fire TV?
No. I dont think it would work on any version of android. Windows only.
can i connect more then one Xbox 360 controller (2) at the same time??
Yes it supports up to 4
Would this work with windows XP? thank you in advance
The easiest way to set this device up is to install the Microsoft drivers and then manually select the driver in your device manager. With that being said there is an option to download XP drivers from the Microsoft site. I installed it on my laptop that runs XP and it worked fine for me.
how does this work i got this in mail and disc wont read i think its too small
Try this link: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows This video should also be helpful: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY8PIGO_li8
Will this work with windows 8.1?
Yes, I have windows 8.1 and it works just fine...but I did have to look on YouTube in order to learn how to install it correctly since it is a little different then the instructions it come with for older forms of windows, but still really really simple and it works great
How do I get the pic axe in the shed....it won't open...is there a patch for this game? Someone else has the same problem!
I cant remember it has been i while since i completed the game. Did you try googling a walkthrough?
cant get pickaxe shed wont open
I never bought that game-this was just a suggested games they put down that I might be interested in. Sorry.
where are all of the boards needed to repair the bridge?
Sorry - I was never able to get this game to even install - something was wrong with it - try a Google search for "Veil of Mystery walkthrough" - good luck! :)
I have made it to the cellar. Used the hammer to get in but now it is not in my inventory so I can't break the wall with the map. Any ideas how to get the hammer back?
Did you turn left after taking out the nails to the cellar - hidden object scene. Get electical tape and fuses? Then go back to cellar and see if you can pick the hammer back up.
can i use this game in windows 8.1
Yep
if i purchase this (Battlefield 4 [Online Game Code]) will i get the full game to download or only the key ?? if only key, where is the game
you get the key, you then take the key and go to your origin client up in the top left corner by the icon itll say Origin: Friends: Help you click the Origin option then add game then it'll give you an option to either Redeem product code or Unify your collection you click redeem product code. Then you copy the key you got on amazon paste it into the Origin product code bar then viola the game is the placed in your games library and is ready to download.
can &#x131; use in europe ?
I don't see why not since it's a game download, not a physical copy with region restrictions.
is the controller support better than BF3? i rember the controller support being horrible in BF3. i played BF4 on PS4 is the PC version different?
Yep. That issue is resolved. You can toggle your running, and crouch also has toggle support.
can I use this game in Windows 7
I use Win7 64bit and this game runs great.
Played BF3 all the time, and never picked up BF4. What's the best deal to get 'everything'? Looks like $49 + $49 - looking for a better deal
If I remember correctly that is about how much I got my copy for about 3-4 months ago but that was just for BF4 and none of the expansions (that I picked up separately) last I looked Walmart had a good deal that included rising china. I personally picked it up at amazon because it was a direct download and I am a BF superfan who couldn't wait to play it.
Can you activate this via: Steam?
I don't believe so. You are stuck signing up and downloading origin, their version of steam.
After download, we cannot access the game. My son's profile lists 16 years old. I paid $20 for this game. Is there an override?
Contact EA support they should be able to assist.
Is this the full game or just part of it?
Full game
Can I Play Online with the PC Download?
yup. buy it off the origins launcher, though. it's 30$ cheaper.

Does this game work outside of the US
Yea it should since the ps3 isn't region coded.
If i order this, will it comes with the artbook in a new cases or will i be cheated?
The standard edition (currently $39.99) comes with both the Final Fantasy X HD Remaster and Final Fantasy X-2 HD Remaster on one disc. The special edition (currently $39.99) is a limited time upgrade that gives you a book-like casing that includes a vibrant 24 page artbook covering both X and X-2, mostly concept art. The collector's edition (currently $79.99) includes a gorgeous hardcover art book, a 6-hour Final Fantasy X HD Remaster original soundtrack blu-ray music disc, and five lithographs of art from both games. I got the standard version so I don't know for sure but if that is true from what I read on a review from this site then special edition does have it the artbook.
Can I play the PS3 version on the Vita? I know the Vita version could play on the PS3, so I am wondering if it could be done the other way?
The game only supports cross-save but not cross-play. You have to buy both the PS3 and the Vita version if you want to play on both systems. But your saved game on the Vita CAN be used on the PS3 and vice versa.
I see that there is special strategy guide for FFX. Now is that because the game has new content or does the guide itself have something extra?
There is some new stuff in the game you need the guide for
Does this version offer Japanese audio?
no is does not but if you have a ps4 i would recomend you purchase the ps4 version it has better colors and full native 1080p.
i know this is a 2 game pack but when i had final fantasy x2 it had a music video intro which i liked a lot does the hd version of x-2 also have that
Yes. It does. Everything is the same. The only thing that changed is the quality.
whats the difference between the standard edition and limited edition
Limited comes with artbook and different case. Both the limited and the standard are the international version so you wont miss much getting the standard.
Any ideas on what the special edition of the game contains?
Unfortunately, it only contains the game. I feel a little cheated, but at least this version of the game without the extra fluff is cheaper.
What's the difference between the Standard edition, the Special edition, and the Collector's edition? I have an American PS3 and I'm trying to decide
The differences are that the Collector's Edition doesn't come in a game case, like the Limited Edition, but unlike the standard. It is all one huge book. The art book is much bigger than the Limited Edition artbook. Has 40 pages where the LE artbook only has 24 and is smaller. The CE also comes with the soundtrack on blu ray and 5 lithographic art prints that are about the size of a sheet of paper.
does this game come with any dlc or vouchers that you redeem?
I have only played 10 and not 10-2 but as far as i know, both games do not come with any additional content other then what was released on the international version of the games.
do you need the original Civ V to play this?
Yes. This is just an expansion pack.
Will this work with Civ 5: Gods and Kings?
Yes, I have both and it works fine
Can I use this without redeeming it on steam? Will it still unlock on my local computer?
It is a download and because the game uses steam to save to your computer, you will need to use steam in order to download it. Sorry if this is not a good thing for you:(
Is this a steam key? And if not will it work with steam?
It is the actual disc. It worked with steam.
Does this come with the steam download code? My PC doesn't have a CD port and i still want a physical copy.
Yes. You can not download other without steam.
Do you need gods and kings for this to work?
No you do not need the gods and king explanation pack to play it will fine without.
When I look at the system requirements, it asks for 8 gb of hard drive space, is that for both the platform and expansion or just for the expansion?
The expansion rewrites over the game data so the expansion needs all 8 gb. To answer your question it is just for the expansion.
Does the pc dvd work with a mac???
There is an option for Mac. But it is download only. Hope this helps.
my laptop doesn't have a cd drive. Does it have a code inside
You could choose PC Download or the Mac Download (depends on which you have), if you cannot use the disc, it has a online game code.

can you play it on windows 8
Yes you can :D
Is it the disk or is it the online download? Also, does it work on HP Pavilion Chromebook?
It's a disc. If it's running Android, probably not. It is Mac and PC compatible.
Is a good starter for someone who's never played before?
Yes
Is this better then sims 4?
To ME, it is,,,the realism, an detail can't be beat if you want realism for your Sims. If you want a CHEAP CARTOONIE and problematic game, get Sims 4. I won't lie, or sugar coat the fact that Sims 3 also has it's glitches also. Occasionally it will freeze, crash, and lag a bit in creator mode, an buy mode. But if you can accept this, and do as I have recommended by perodically SAVE an continue playing, Sims 3 is FAR SUPERIOR to Sims 4. I belong to one of the MANY Sims fan groups on facebook, an I see an read the horror stories of what goes on with Sims 4. It's not pretty.
Can I add other expansions to the sims 3 starter pack?
Only if the expansion you want to add is an expansion of The Sims 3, otherwise you will have to get the starter version of the expansion you bought
Do you still need to do in app purchases like you do with the free download in order to really play?
Are you talking about the disk starter kit, you just put them in the computer Ahs follow the directions , it might want you to have an origin account Our Sims online account though
Is this the actual sims 3 or just an expansion ?
Actual Sims 3 with 2 expansions &#128522;
What age would you recommend this for?
12 and over
I already own this game and played on windows 8, but I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and it doesn't work. What do I do to continue playing?
You need to go into the origin account you created to play the game and make sure you install all updates before attempting to play or game will have issues. You can access all your sim stuff on origin you may have to enter license code but once it's there you can access it from anywhere.
Can you play the game offline?
Yes, that is the only way you play it.
can you play it on windows 8

My son plays games on his MacBook Air. Are they compatible with a MacBook?
I am sure it is compatible with MacBook or any laptop. But I wouldn't know for sure because mine broke in less than 3 months, before I could use it on other devices.
To chat with this on PS4 does it need to be plugged into the controller?
No you don't. Just plug the optical cable and the usb into the ps4 and configure it in the dashboard. Only in xbox you need to plug the cable into the controller.
does the mic work wirelessly with ps4 or does it need to be connected to the controller?
No I doesnt need to be connected with the control You could do It but that's up to you
Do I need the transmitter to use the headset? In other words, can I listen to music without the transmitter stand from my phone?
No you need the base
does this headset have a 3.5 mm jack for mobile? are they comparable to the a50? better? worse?
The headset is self only has a micro USB port for charging. The wireless base has a 3.5 mm jack. This means the base needs a power source (wall plug), but can be used with a mobile device. Just not very practical for mobile use. I've never used a50, so I can't compare them.
Does this headset work Wirelessly with the xbox one is my question.
From what i can tell it will work with xbox one. I found this video on youtube explaining how to do it. You seem to need an attachment to get voice chat but the headset will get sound by plugging in the optical to the xbox here is the link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8uoAkm9u8g
Does the PS4 allow 7.1 through PS4 dashboard audio out sound settings or does it limit the output to 5.1?
Yes I believe allows 7.1 and I have the same headphones and it works really well. I hope this helps
Can this be hooked up to my Xbox One and PS4 simultaneously?
Probably only with an optical switch, which the manual ones are very cheap
does this headset work with xbox one
Yes
why is mine all crackly? do i need a new audio cord? 2.5mm to 3.5mm? Where do i get it?
It should have came with a 2.5 to a 2.5 if you are having problems I would just get a 2.5 to a 3.5 adapter

Will these work with the playstation 4 in full surround sound?
Yes they do. Completely awesome
How long does the battery last?
I just used mine for 6 straight hours, and 2 hours the day before, still going strong. I would estimate 10 hours full charge to dead.
So far ive read it works on the PS4, Xbox1, PS3, and 360? Is it wireless for all systems? just plug them in the controller for sound and chat?
I have only used it on my xbox one and my computer. Yes it is wireless but you will have to plug a wire from the headset to the controller on the Xbox one.
Does the stand have two optical inputs or is it one in and one out?
It's 1 in 1 out
I plan on using this for PS4, XBONE, and PC. Can I leave the USB for the headphones plugged into my PC and have it still work with the consoles?
Yes the usb is just the power,but your just have to switch the optical cable to the system your going to use.
Does it work for the Xbox 1?
Yes it does
I have a PC and a PS3 on one TV. Can I connect this to the TV via optical and get full surround and mic capabilities, or must it go into the devices?
I had a similar set up it completely work. I have optics out of computer and out to a optical to analog speaker system
Do these break easily, are they worth buying? In a scale of 1-10 how would rate the bass and sound quality of the surround sound?
Joel, these are one of the best headsets I've ever owned. There worth every penny and as for bass and sound quality it is also at there best you can't go wrong. Just try them and see what awaits you!!!
What's the durability? I am very careful with my electronics. How long do these last?
I'm very careful with mine as well, to me I feel like they will last longer if your very careful like you said.
does this headset have blutooth?
No... it doesn't have any bluetooth functionality. Would be nice if it did though.

I just used mine for 6 straight hours, and 2 hours the day before, still going strong. I would estimate 10 hours full charge to dead.
So far ive read it works on the PS4, Xbox1, PS3, and 360? Is it wireless for all systems? just plug them in the controller for sound and chat?
I have only used it on my xbox one and my computer. Yes it is wireless but you will have to plug a wire from the headset to the controller on the Xbox one.
Does the stand have two optical inputs or is it one in and one out?
It's 1 in 1 out
I plan on using this for PS4, XBONE, and PC. Can I leave the USB for the headphones plugged into my PC and have it still work with the consoles?
Yes the usb is just the power,but your just have to switch the optical cable to the system your going to use.
Does it work for the Xbox 1?
Yes it does
I have a PC and a PS3 on one TV. Can I connect this to the TV via optical and get full surround and mic capabilities, or must it go into the devices?
I had a similar set up it completely work. I have optics out of computer and out to a optical to analog speaker system
Do these break easily, are they worth buying? In a scale of 1-10 how would rate the bass and sound quality of the surround sound?
Joel, these are one of the best headsets I've ever owned. There worth every penny and as for bass and sound quality it is also at there best you can't go wrong. Just try them and see what awaits you!!!
What's the durability? I am very careful with my electronics. How long do these last?
I'm very careful with mine as well, to me I feel like they will last longer if your very careful like you said.
does this headset have blutooth?
No... it doesn't have any bluetooth functionality. Would be nice if it did though.
Is it free roam?
Daughter says yes, but have to do missions to beat the game. Hope it helps:)
i sit two player
According to my son, it is not two player, just single player. However, you can play others via the internet. Hope this helps...
do you have the other disk so you can play online with different people or do you just have the campaign disk or do you have both disks
I have both disks.
The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?? El juego viene en multilenguaje? lo quiero en espa&ntilde;ol
It's possible to change the system's settings, I believe.
is the whole game a prequel?
Yes
game freezes since began playing and today all of auto saves disappeared on XBOX360?
That sucks. I've never had any problem with any of the Batman Arkham games.
Does this game allow split screen mode?
Sorry, no, for neither single or multiplayer
Is it free Roam?
Yes
Do I lose any content if I buy this game used?
No you dont.
Have all the glitches been fixed(Nov 2014)? Do I need to download any patch? Or is the game good to go right out of the package? Thank
The game is great...it come with 2 CDs.. The 2 one u have to play it in xbox live ..
Can this game be played by more than one player, offline. I mean, can my two sons play against each other or as a team offline with two controls?
I think yes, just like FIFA & NHL
Can I play it in spanish language?
maybe, if u set ur console language to spanish
can it be played on play station 2 machine ?
No
multiplayer online, Can you four people (friends) in separate locations play together online? and against each other two on one team on two on other?
I'm not sure I hardly play online/multiplayer, however I think it's all random but then again I'm not really sure.
does anyone has this problem: when i play it and then turn off the ps3... and then i try to play it again it doesnt work! it gets stuck. Any help?
no it work fine.. the kids play that game all damn day
Anybody deep into 2k14? Who has the best defense on the game other than the Heat and who is the best match for the Raptors!?
For me it's the lakers. I've played a season and went 82-0 at pro difficulty. You just have to be tenacious on D (get 5 steals a game) and keep the PGs in front of you. You'll also need ball movement and shooters (drain those 3s!). It'd also be great to have one superstar that can forcefully get you out of a funk.

Has anyone gotten this version for PS3 and gotten it on Vita free by Cross-Buy?
I own a Vita version but not the PS3 version of the game. It is not cross-buy because it is not the same game. The Vita isn't powerful enough to run the full game so they made Arkham Origins: Blackgate which from what I remember takes place after the story of Arkham Origins. It is a different game entirely. It is in a 2D/3D mode. It has less fighting and more exploring of buildings and puzzles. It was an ok game.
Have the season pass and/or DLC's been integrated in one single game/CD yet or do you still have purcahse them separately?
You still have to purchase them separately. With as much time that has passed since the game came out I don't think we will get a Complete edition with all the DLC on disc.
Can you play this on PS4?
Nope no game for the ps3 can be played on the ps4 also goes for the xbox 360
Any word coming down the pipes of a special edition that will include all DLC and such, like the last two?
Not sure, it's up to Warner Bros. Games Montral
Do this one comes with the Deathstroke dlc?
The one I got did come with the Deathstroke Challenge Pack.
Have they patched out the bugs that a lot of people were experiencing?
Well not completely sure but I do kniw that some of the bugs people were experiencing was due to the fact that you had to complete certain obstacles a specific way
Hi, I would like to know whether it is the full game or is it the 10 GB version and we have to download the extra 8 GB?
well when i bought it from amazon it was the digital version. they just gave me the code through an email. and when i redeemed it on psn i had to download the game then install it. once i launched the game there was a mandatory data install as well.
i want to buy this game but i want to know if i buy this specific product does it come with the deathstroke dlc?
Haroon, I'm in Brazil and, in my region, the code doesn't work. If you're in America, I guess it does.
So the very weird wrapper I received for this game said that it had exclusive downloadable content. However there was no code with the game to redeem
There should be a code for deathstroke. If there not make sure the one you purchased was not used. If the one you bought is new contact game developer
Can you use remote play with the playstation 3 to the playstation vita slim
Afraid not. Sorry. There is a list of ps3 psp/vita remote play titles on the bottom of the wiki article. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Play
is a controller needed?
Nope, not for the PC version. I do recommend an analog controller to take advantage of the shooting and passing features. (if you use those features)
does nba 2k14 work for mac
As far as i know, no
windows 8?
Windows 7.
Does this game allow split screen mode?
Yes if you have 2 controllers (or someone wants to use mouse and keyboard.) you could easily play play multiplayer (splitscreen).
Does this game work on a Windows 7 computer?
yes
Can you play it on windows 8 a gateway computer
yes you can
is there a mac version because it says there is but you can't buy one.
No, I'm sorry I don't have Mac version.
I can't even open the game. Each time I click on the shortcut on my desktop or try opening it through steam it just goes to a black window than closes
Could be that you need to update your drivers. Or try reinstalling the game.
is a controller needed?
No is not needed, but a cotroller is cheap and i think it enhances the gameplay a lot

VS NBA 2K12??? I have 2k12 and like it. Can someone with experience compare the two?? Thanks
2k 14 is a huge step up, its a most buy. on 2k 14 not only are the players updated but every thing has changed in the game. The player play more realistic and there are more option in career mode.
can you create a player and play with a create a player in frachise mode
My son says you can create a player in career mode.
Can I skip more games in this version in career mode? I have 2k12 and would like to play many games a season but not a key game 3 times a week.
You can't, you have to play the key games at least.... However if I were you I'd get 2k15. It's a lot better. Unless you have the 360 still then this is a better buy. Since 2k14 and 2k15 are basically the same game. But if you have a PS4 or Xbox one, get 2k15. Hope this helps you.
can you play this game on a xbox 360 without a kinect? I purchased this a now I just realized that it has better with connect at the top.
Yes
Does it come in US(NTSC), Asia(NTSCJ), or Europe(PAL)?
I am not sure
Can you please check back of your box to see if it requires HDTV? Nephews have an old TV.
No
is it the best nba 2k game and if not what is the best?
2k14 introduced a couple of new things to the genre of basketball but 2k13 in my opinion was the best 2k ever made for current gen consoles.
Can you update to current or close to current rosters? I heard 2k15 is really lacking on the 360.
No
when does the server go down for nba 2k14
more thank likely a month or 2 after 2k15 comes out
comes in Spanish language.?
Yes.

Is there a "customizable officer" feature?
There is not. There's no mechanic to create your own character (like in Dynasty Warriors 4). I still consider Dynasty Warriors 4 the best game in the series, with 8 being the second best. This is one reason for that.
what type of language does this game have???
English
Does it have cuss words in it?
No I do not remember there any profanity or cussing in this game. I believe it's rated T for Teens
Is it 2 player
I would assume you can do split screen co-op as in the previous games, haven't tested it on 8 though. As far as I know though, there is no online play.
what other languages are available?
English and Japanese. PC had German and something else
Is it Chinese subtitle or English?
It is in english.
How do you pick a color when you order it?
It changes color according to DPI setting. Hitting the DPI plus/- button adjusts the DPI, each DPI level is associated with a certain color.
So does it go up to 2000 DPI or 4000 DPI?
If you download the anker software it's goes up to 4000
Does the scroll wheel click to intervals, or is it completely smooth?
It has pretty soft, but definitely tactile, clicks as you scroll it.
Does this work with Mac computers?
I use mine on my iMac running mountain lion and it works great for me.
How long does this mouse last? (Micro switches, scroll wheel, wheel click etc) I'm an intensive computer user/gamer. How many clicks is it rated at?
It's rated at 5 million clicks for each of the three top buttons and 1 million clicks for the two on the side. Though I'm also a heavy user and it's lasted me well beyond the expected lifetime. As with any technology, it'll last depending on your good/bad luck and how well you treat it.
Is this mouse good for League of Legends?
Literally any mouse is good for League of Legends.. Lol I enjoy it!(: I play League and SC2 with it no problem!
Weight and Size. Is it light and cheap or does it have a nice weight? Is the size big enough to be comfortable for people with large hands?
It's heavier than the standard mice that come with most computers, but I wouldn't necessarily call it 'heavy.' It IS large and ideal for people with large hands.
The mouse information says 5 user profiles bound to specific games but i don't see the list of games. Will this mouse work with World of Warcraft?
I think by specific it means user-defined. So yes, it should, but you need to set it up through their software.
Can you set the two side buttons to Shift or Ctrl? Or can you only set them to the keys that you would usually hit after hitting Shift or Ctrl?
Yes, you can program all the buttons, including the two side buttons, to be any desired keys.
Does the Scroll Wheel also act as a button when you click it?
Yes it does
A key's light already went out after a month. Is this a normal problem or i there a way to get a new one from the warranty?
I had the same thing happen- I opened a ticket on the corsair support website http://corsair.force.com/ You'll need to register first so you can log into your account to request an RMA. I didn't have some of the necessary info but I did have an email of my receipt so that did it. It was super easy, good luck!! : )
On the Silver Cherry MX Red (CH-9000019-NA) Are the backlighting LEDs Blue, Red, switchable? Description says blue, then says red
blue
Does this include a 2 year Limited Warranty offered by Corsair if I buy from amazon?
Yes it will always come with a 2 year limited factory warranty anywhere you buy it.
Does anybody know if this will become available once again? i would love one with blue LEDs instead of the red
No, due to LED failure faults with this model, Corsair has discontinued and moved on to K70 RGB
Why is there two usb cords?
one is for the keyboard and the other one is for the USB port it has in the back
do the keys fade? I have bought several keyboards where the keys scratch easily and the letters fade off revealing a white plastic underneath.
Mine haven't and I've got weeks of total use out of it.
Has anyone owned the silver edition of this keyboard for more than 6 months without LEDs failing?
I'm right around 3 months and they are still great
Is the USB on the back 2.0 or 3.0?
2.0 but i plugged it into 3.0 & it worked too.
It says it's free shipping and global eligible but during check out there is no option for free shipping? Can someone explain the reason?
Order with Free Shipping by Amazon: If your order is $35 or more, you may qualify for free shipping. With free shipping, your order will be delivered 5-8 business days after all of your items are available to ship, including pre-order items. Free shipping is limited to U.S. address. "global eligible" means the item can be shipped international but not for free.
So I've noticed that, despite the good quality build, the LED's fail rather quickly for such an expensive keyboard. Has anyone NOT experienced this?
Yes I have, about twenty four of mine failed after some time...
Anyone using it on Linux (specifically, ubuntu)? If so, maybe you can mention how compatible it is
Volume up down and mute work out of the box. I'm not sure what the other key up to is as I have no need for more keys that the normal ones and volume. (I run arch and volume icon for the controlling of it.)
The only thought that I have for this keyboard is how are the LEDs?
They work great, I see lots of people complaining that they burn out or die quickly but I've had mine for 6 months now with no issues. I keep mine on the lowest setting as it's bright enough.
Is the wrist-rest removeable?
Yes the wrist rest is removable
Are the keys raised? I'm asking because it looks like it's very easy to clean if the keys aren't inside something.
The design of the keys aren't like traditional keyboards where you push down a key, and it goes below some hole. On the K70, the aluminum plate you see IS the bottom plate for all the keys. Not only does this design allow for easy cleaning, but the way the back light LEDS shine will also be reflected off of the aluminum body, giving it a very nice glow under/around each key. I spilled a drop or 2 of orange juice on the keyboard the first day i got it, and it landed not on top of any keys but rather under them. I simply used the included key puller and removed the keys near the spillage, and cleaned it up real easy.
Does this keyboard have the ability to toggle the Windows Key on and off?
Yes
Is this worth it? I've never even considered getting a $100 keyboard before.
Yes yes yes! It's so worth the money! My boyfriend has one and I got one too! He games and plays Battlefield 4 mostly and he has had a lot of keyboards, none compare to this one! I don't even game and I had to have it! I'm very picky with my keyboards & this one is perfect! Volume control, lights up red so it's easy to see even in the dark, amazing quality, etc! Highly recommend!
Does mac support this keyboard???
Most of the keys, yes. There may be a few portions such as the media keys or num/caps/scroll lock LEDs that aren't fully supported though. Edit: As I said, it works under OSX. There are even some of the reviews that confirm this: http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XSK10XCZLS6/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EU5WIDS&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=
Does this board still have the LED Issues? (Them dying off after a month or two)
I too read the reports and was concerned about this. I'm happy to report that after 6 months of use all is still working well. Corsair was aware of the issue and it appears they have adjusted their manufacturing accordingly.
Corsair Vengeance K70 or CM Storm QuickFire TK?
That is a difficult question, since the form factor differs on the two. Not quite comparing apples to apples. I looked up the CM Storm QuickFire TK and I see they incorporated the DLT-PrtScn-Arrow Key section as 2nd Functions into the Numpad area. This smaller form factor decreases the distance between your left and right hand and may be more comfortable for your shoulders, or that's atleast the idea. I haven't owned a smaller form factor keyboard myself. Form factor wise it would be better to compare the K65 with the CM Storm QuickFire TK. The QuickFire TK would win hands down, because of a lack of features on the K65- no wrist rest, back-lighting, etc. The K70 has a very nice volume controller on the keyboard and dedicated media keys, but if you don't use media keys that often or if you do, but don't mind using them as a 2nd Function, it doesn't matter that much not having them as dedicated keys. The K70 has a very nice wrist rest and this may sound stupid, but this wins high points for me with the K70, since when I use a desktop keyboard really alot, I get keyboard wrist inflammation, if that is even a term. I bought a wrist gel (3M make for both my keyboard and mouse) months before I decided on which mechanical keyboard I was going to buy so that I wouldn't prefer one over the other just because of this add-on and so that I would have one if I decided to go with a keyboard without one. I used that gel wrist rest with my mouse, and it worked for a decent amount of months to stop the small frequent friction of my wrist against the mousepad/wooden table, but then I started to get a lasting pain a little higher up in my wrist because of the declining position I had to hold my wrist in to use the mouse with the wrist rest. That said, I have no problems with the K70 wrist rest, and that just shows how well designed it is and how even if you buy a separate wrist rest, it will probably not be as comfortable as the one provided with the K70. Subjectively for me, I would go with the K70 instead of the CM Storm QuickFire TK, since I enjoy the dedicated media keys and volume controller and its wrist rest. At the time I bought my K70, only the cherry mx red version was available. I would advise you to go with the cherry mx brown version out now since it has a little bit of a tactile feedback. Also, get yourself some rubber o-rings from amazon that reduces the key travel by supposedly 2mm and reduces bottoming out noise. I use it myself, trust me, it works very well. You might want to wait if you want more back-light color options on your keyboard since the corsair K70 RGB is almost out (all though only with cherry mx red keys at the moment, I would advise cherry mx browns, like I said). It gives you options to all the colors of the rainbow and more. It cost $40 more than the regular K70 version, so it's up to you if it is worth the cost. If you have to go for a keyboard now, I would say get the corsair K70 cherry mx brown. I also use the textured key-caps W, S and D, not the A since it is curved to the left and for the purposes I use it, I don't find it comfortable. These textured key-caps are quite nice for a little extra tactile feel.
What dose the BIOS switch do on the top of the keyboard?
The BIOS switch both adjusts the polling rate and allows you to turn off advanced keyboard features for compatibility with certain motherboard BIOS and KVM switches. Settings of 1, 2, 4, and 8 are millisecond polling rates (1ms = 1000hz). Switching to BIOS reduces the polling rate and turns off other features for maximum compatibility. By default we ship at 1ms (1000Hz) and most gamers will prefer to just use the setting. from http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=118655
Is there a 2-player mode where my wife and I play on the same screen?
Yeah, I play with my friend everyday. even four people can play, 2 on each team.
Does someone know if this video game come with the Spanish language option? Thank you.
Yes, but this game is terrible, it is not like any other FIFA 14 game. I played it 3 days and then put it away and never played it again. I have every copy of FIFA since FIFA06 and have played hundreds if not thousands of hours. DON"T BUY THIS GAME! NO COMPRE ESTE JUEGO..ES MALISIMO, NO ES NADA COMO LOS OTRO FIFA, MEJOR ESPERAR PARA EL NUEVO FIFA15...ESTE ES MALISIMO, NISIQUIERA LO JUEGO YA.
What about the teams from Argentina, Colombia or Brazil, are there in this game ???
It seems that the Teams that were relegated last year are still in game. IE: Nautico, Ponte Preta, Portuguesa, & Vasco da Gama are still in the Serie A of Brazil in Game. In reality it should be Criciuma, Coritiba, Chapecoense, & Figueirense. I didn't go into dept in Argentina and Colombian Leagues since its not as familiar to me, but it is fair to assume the same will be the case.
Is playing the game with the move controller as enjoyable as playing it with the dualshock?
I don't recommend playing with a move controller
Is Liga BBVA Bancomer MX (Mexico)'s teams included in this edition?
of course my friend
What is the difference between FIFA 14 and 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil?
I'm not sure because my kids don't have the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, but I think the later is a special edition issued little before the 2014 world cup started and updated to include players and teams which were about to participate in that specific tournament.
Does it have Be A Pro Seasons??
Yes
Regarding FIFA 2014, does the game require the MOVE controller or can 1 or 2 players use the standard game controller to play with maximum enjoyment?
This version as well as 2013 version is fully Move compatible. Though I doubt you will be able to execute the full array of moves without a standard controller.
How this year's version compare to the 2013 version? Is the learning curve steep to someone new who hasn/t played fifa before?
This year's version is very similar to previous versions in terms of controls. Small differences like ball physics tweaks are new but are only going to cause issues if you're very familiar with an old FIFA title. But I find this one to be easier than 11 for example and very similar to 13. The learning curve is not steep in my opinion. If you've never played FIFA you might get bugged that not everything is going exactly the way you want right away, but after some practice you'll find you can score in creative ways and really enjoy the game
Im going to buy a fifa game, and dont want to pay a lot. I am an offline mode (franchise type mode) person, so is fifa 14,13, or 12 the best to get?
As a franchise player as well, if you are on a PS3 I would go with Fifa 13.
Is there a 2-player mode where my wife and I play on the same screen?

If you've never played FIFA you might get bugged that not everything is going exactly the way you want right away, but after some practice you'll find you can score in creative ways and really enjoy the game
Im going to buy a fifa game, and dont want to pay a lot. I am an offline mode (franchise type mode) person, so is fifa 14,13, or 12 the best to get?
As a franchise player as well, if you are on a PS3 I would go with Fifa 13.
If I buy this game, will I get to play in the 2014 World Cup Brazil? Is there a way to play the World Cup in the game? Like, experience it?
I think you can play it in the Ultimate team mode but I wanted to play the full game so I got the other game.
If you buy this game, would you get to play an exhibiton, penalties, season, and career, or do you only get to play online matches?
I'm not sure if that's a serious question. The game features multiple game modes. You can play online, start a manager career or a player career, exhibition matches and skill games.
- Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Yes it does. It has a numberof multiplayer options including co-op. It works very well.
I ordered this item, and received the Central/South America version (with Messi, Vidal and Falcao on the cover). Will this work on PAL?
If it's new, u have no problem... U certainly enjoy it... But used u wil regret as I used a used one, which looked like new just for a week
how many players can play at a time?
On one system? You can have up to four people playing. Ultimate online season can only have one person playing though unless you do a single player season instead of online.
Does this come with French language mode?
Yes desire this game come With french language
why is the xbox 1 cheaper than the xbox 360?
Because the xbox 360 version is more popular and has better graphics than xbox one
is this game in spanish language?
Spanish & English
will it work with XBOX One?
It should work. But first you will have to purchase the license for it. You should get the prompts to purchase license after you download the game. It should come up as a pin on your dashboard. Hope this works for you.
Why did EA ruin this game with scripting, handicapping, and momentum?
Very good

This keyboard looks as if it sits in a try. Can it be removed from this tray, sacrificing the media keys above the function keys?
The keyboards near is a solid piece of aluminum. It's not modular.
So could this be a nice replacement for the good old Logitech G15? Or not yet? I hope those 18 keys on the side can be set up just as fast.
It's a perfect replacement, K95 is very neat keyboard. I've switched from G15 to K95. I miss a little screen at first, but I used it as clock most of the time.
Can one easily replace the LED's if one goes out?
No, not to replace. When LED fails complete swap during warranty, afterwards go live with it. LEDs on the Ks seem to fail quite often.
Hey, I'm a programmer and the one thong that really matters to me is: Can you adjust the G-Keys to type text? It would be very cool!
Yes of course, any combination of keys can be pressed for the macros.
Is this the keyboard that has 16.8 million color schemes
No, that one is the K95 MX RGB. It's scheduled for release in August (subject to change without notice). This model is white LEDs.
i have a k70 and a buddy is trading it from me for a k90, should i do it ? is mine better ?
Depends on what you're using the keyboard for, I guess. The k70 had the option to go with cherry red switches (better for gaming), blue switches (balanced for typing and gaming) or brown switches (better for typing, good for gaming)... the k90 comes with the cherry reds, and it has 18 programmable keys. If you use it for gaming, and you'll make use of the programmable keys then the k90 is a better keyboard. If your k70 has cherry reds then the only real difference will be the programmable keys.
Can you record text macros on the 'G" keys?
Yes you can; the macro software available from the Corsair website - http://www.corsair.com/en-us/support/downloads - includes a .pdf manual which shows how to program and edit macros, both on the hardware and software sides.
Is the wrist rest removable?
Yes
how wide is the keyboard?
Around 20'inches
is it compatible with window 8.1
Yes, I upgraded 2 of my machines and MS Windows 8.1 had no issues with my K95 and M95 devices. I did download and install the latest drivers from Corsair in order to have the full set of utilities installed.
Is this game appropriate for a 7 year old boy?
I don't see why not.
does this game work on 2ds?
Yes
Is this game better than Mario and Luigi 'Bowser's Inside Story'?
As a big fan of the previous games, no, it's not, by far. It's twice as long, with charmless writing, padding and backtracking, and endless tutorials.
is it Japanese version or American version&#xFF1F;
American.
Does it come with the PIN for the Nintendo shop? I can't seem to find the code anywhere.
No i did not get one probably the only way to get it is if you get the game brand new unopened
Is the dream world too cheesey? Or is it not?
It's got its moments but it's fun!

Okay what is the difference between the map pack version and the regular black ops two?
You get the map pack that has a 15$ value for 5 cents more than the original version. The map pack has 4 new multiplayer maps, 1 bonus weapon, and 1 zombies map.
How many hours is the campaign ? Is this game worth it if I have no intention of playing online ?
Nope (about 6 hours)
Does this game come as disk media or is it a game case with an online download code inside?
The game is on a disc, while the dlc is a code
Does anyone know the file size of all the updates since launch day to now? Thank you if you do.
No but with black ops 2 you can download it on a xbox compatible usb drive 16 gig recommended.
Can you "turn off the blood" in this version? My nephew wants this feature. (I personally know nothing about the game :-) )
Sorry, I don't know. I purchased this as a gift for my grandson.
Does this come with the nuketown map on it?
Yes
This game is in Spanish language?
Yes
Do you need xbox live to download the dlc
Yes you do.
Is the Map pack included within the game or is there a code included?
How do I find that out? I play multi most of the time and don't play online at all.
how many players is it offline?
In offline you can play split screen or the zombies mode and u can play 4 players
have a question about these recertified headphones. why where they recertified and is there a warrenty on the product?
Unknown as to why they were recertified. But these are factory recertified and do come with a warranty.
Do i need to buy a USB to use these?
I'm....not sure what you are asking. This is a corded usb headset, which means, you can use them on anything that has a USB port.
Does this item completely work for PS3? Including the microphone?
yes
Do these work with the pc and wii U?
Yes they work for wii U, pc, 3ds, ds, ps3, ps4, xbox 360, ipods, and iphones
are these a usb headset
Both they have a standard connector for iPhone iPod ect and a USB converter that connects to PC and gaming consoles but you can solely use the headphones without usb
Does it come with the thingy to play with HDMI and the AV cables for the 360?
It has everything you need to plug into the 360.
Can you get game and chat audio on the Xbox 360
Yes
does it say ps4 on the box
Yes
is the material on the earcups synthetic leather?
Yes, it is some sort of man made leather. The product is worth the price, much better than same priced TB's. Although they can be bothersome to wear for a long period. I hope this helps.

Is there a 2-player mode where my wife and I play on the same screen?
Yeah, I play with my friend everyday. even four people can play, 2 on each team.
Does someone know if this video game come with the Spanish language option? Thank you.
Yes, but this game is terrible, it is not like any other FIFA 14 game. I played it 3 days and then put it away and never played it again. I have every copy of FIFA since FIFA06 and have played hundreds if not thousands of hours. DON"T BUY THIS GAME! NO COMPRE ESTE JUEGO..ES MALISIMO, NO ES NADA COMO LOS OTRO FIFA, MEJOR ESPERAR PARA EL NUEVO FIFA15...ESTE ES MALISIMO, NISIQUIERA LO JUEGO YA.
What about the teams from Argentina, Colombia or Brazil, are there in this game ???
It seems that the Teams that were relegated last year are still in game. IE: Nautico, Ponte Preta, Portuguesa, & Vasco da Gama are still in the Serie A of Brazil in Game. In reality it should be Criciuma, Coritiba, Chapecoense, & Figueirense. I didn't go into dept in Argentina and Colombian Leagues since its not as familiar to me, but it is fair to assume the same will be the case.
Is playing the game with the move controller as enjoyable as playing it with the dualshock?
I don't recommend playing with a move controller
Is Liga BBVA Bancomer MX (Mexico)'s teams included in this edition?
of course my friend
What is the difference between FIFA 14 and 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil?
I'm not sure because my kids don't have the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, but I think the later is a special edition issued little before the 2014 world cup started and updated to include players and teams which were about to participate in that specific tournament.
Does it have Be A Pro Seasons??
Yes
Regarding FIFA 2014, does the game require the MOVE controller or can 1 or 2 players use the standard game controller to play with maximum enjoyment?
This version as well as 2013 version is fully Move compatible. Though I doubt you will be able to execute the full array of moves without a standard controller.
How this year's version compare to the 2013 version? Is the learning curve steep to someone new who hasn/t played fifa before?
This year's version is very similar to previous versions in terms of controls. Small differences like ball physics tweaks are new but are only going to cause issues if you're very familiar with an old FIFA title. But I find this one to be easier than 11 for example and very similar to 13. The learning curve is not steep in my opinion. If you've never played FIFA you might get bugged that not everything is going exactly the way you want right away, but after some practice you'll find you can score in creative ways and really enjoy the game

If I already have Skyrim and just wanted to add the expansions, would I be able to continue with my game if I got this or have to start over?
You would absolutely be able to continue! The DLC comes on the disk and all you do is install it onto your system, it will go right along with your saves.
i have regular skyrim i want to know if you buy it will you get to keep your save?
Absolutely. Your character and progress stay as they are and you can continue through both expansion packs.
Does it require internet?
No.only for updates
Is the DLC in the disc or is it a download code?
Skyrim Legendary edition has all 3 DLCs on the disc. In the PS3 menu, you will see the icon for Skyrim, then just below it will be the icon for the DLCs. Select that icon and it will take you into a menu showing the DLCs and you can choose which ones you want to install, and it also gives you options as to which language version to install. It is best to choose the language that matches the region code of the PS3, such as English version DLC for North American region code PS3. The disc will install the DLCs to the PS3's hard drive, then I believe it will require a restart of the system. Once that is done, you can then play Skyrim as usual. The extra icon for the DLCs will still be there below the Skyrim one, in case for any reason you wish to uninstall a DLC. You can install the DLCs and then play any saved game files that were made before installing the DLCs. If your character in the saved file meets certain criteria for triggering the DLC content, such as having fought the first dragon at the Western Watchtower, then the next time you fast travel you will likely encounter the Cultists. It is possible to have the cultists and Durak approach you at the same time, if you are over level 10 and have completed the quest Dragon Rising. If this occurs, they tend to talk over each other which can be confusing. As for Hearthfire, the sites of the new homes will have changed slightly, usually including a wood chopping block and some landscape like boulders or fallen trees may have been shifted. Also, the stone quarries and clay deposits available across Skyrim will have appeared and you will be able to mine them with a pickaxe. Also, the clothing, armor, and appearance of vampires will have changed if you have Dawnguard installed.
Is there a difference between the game if I buy it new or i can just buy a used?
No difference at all. Make sure if you want all the downloadable content that you buy the LEGENDARY EDITION.
Will this play on a PS4?
No
What is the biggest difference between this legendary edition and the greatest hits version? if I just want to play the game, which version is best?
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Legendary Edition is the best version to get because it comes with all DLC released for the game.
Is there any nudity in this game ? (this is the only problem I have against getting the game) please reply-thank you
Because you are fine with murder but the human form is too filthy.
I want to buy this for a friend who wants to play Skyrim with DLC's but cant access PSN will he be able to use the DLCs? without internet??
Yes, the dlc comes within the game; it's just like downloading the game to your ps3 and the dlc you have to download from your cd to your ps3 seperately.
This version is pal/uk or ntsc/usa?
NTSC
do i need internet connection to download dlc content onto my xbox?
With the legendary edition comes two disks. The first disc is the base game. The second disk contains all the DLC and its own installer, so you will not need an Internet connection. Just the second disk :)
How much space do the DLCs take up on the hard drive once they've been installed?
In all it took 1.5 gigs, so nothing to really worry about taking up space.
Do I have to start a fresh game to play the DLC? I have a level 12 character and I don't want to start from scratch.
No, all of the content can be played going forward. If you were level 40 or above it might not be as fun but that's a low enough level it will be no problem.
What is the difference between the Legendary Edition and the other one?
The Legendary edition has all of the DLC content that was ever released for Skyrim. I would definitely go with this version of the game.
Why the m rating?
If you really explore everything there is to offer in the game, it can get Mature. For an average player just playing the game it shouldn't be a problem. However if you try really hard you can encounter some Gore in battles and in cut scenes, you can experience some really cartoony drug/alcohol use, There is some language, and down right immoral values through out. However, I have played for hours and never seen anything sexual about the game at all.
Are the bugs worked out? Last time I played on the DLC I had duplicate NPCS in my custom house and I'd encounter duplicate mobs
Thats strange, surprisingly this is pretty stable, I haven't had any issues with it, I don't know how long ago you played but they have done some updates to the game to help prevent bugs. I've encountered only one issue and that was my shield literally disappeared, like in the game I still had it and still blocked and moved like I had it but it was not visible and it wouldn't allow me to do any crafting, I restarted my system and booted up my save and it was fine. In any game this massive you will need be a little understanding of bugs. Some things pertaining to the game are hard to navigate like curing vampirism and such...some people just don't know those things so I'd do some googling on that kinda stuff. This is a great game and worth the buy though, I've had many many many hours of fun playing this game through again and still have not completed the DLC storys yet.
If i buy a used version will i still get all the DLC?
As long as it is legendary edition of skyrim, with the 2 discs. 1 disc being the actual game disc and the second disk being the DLC content. Used or new as long as you have those 2 discs
It says "Better with Kinect Sensor" but is it really necessary?
Kinect is problematic, and you do not actually need it.
Do I need to have played Oblivion to understand Skyrim?
Not at all, the game does have some history based on the previous game but that doesn't matter to how you play at all and there it no character carry over like in mass effect. It will take you weeks to play all of the quests and find everything. Have fun!
Should I get the PC version if I don't really care for the Xbox controls?
You can set your PC to use an xbox controller anyway, you can also tweak the console on PC, a big plus if you're really into the game!
can i play this on the pc with an xbox 360 usb controller?
Short answer: Yes. Long Answer: I just tested my Game Stop Brand Xbox 360 controller with usb converter on my Windows 7 64-bit PC, and it worked perfectly. I personally think the game is significantly easier to play with a keyboard and mouse, but yes, you are perfectly capable of playing with the controller. (Other operating systems may or may not work [I have no experience with Windows 8 nor previous versions]). If you have a different operating system, I recommend looking it up on google, or asking another person before you buy the game. P.S. If you need help setting up your controller, just let me know, or there may be tutorials online.
Does this legendary edition have the game on a disc that I can install or is it only a download client? I do not want to spend a week downloading
It has the base game, but it does not have any of the DLC on disk. You need to register the product code with Steam and then you can download the DLC.
if i buy the legendary edition do i need internet conection to activate it? if game needs autentification or updates im screwd
When I installed the game, I had to log into my steam acct and validate. It also had to download updates. After install, you can choose to play offline.
Is this Legendary Edition an actual standalone version of Skyrim, or is it an add-on where I would need to buy the original game as well?
This is the game plus the add-ons. You don't need to buy anything else. Just make sure you have a Steam account.
is it compatible to windows 8?
Yes, I currently run mine on Windows 8.
Could anyone recommend a good/great PC to play Skyrim with mods and such. Thanks!
I'm not a computer wiz, but it'll be hard for anyone to answer without knowing which mods, some are rougher than others.
I want to buy this for my 14 year old son for Christmas. However, I'm confused by the PC download vs. the PC version. Which is the way to go?
PC - Download, its a digital code that you redeem on steam, you will have to then download the whole game. PC - Version it the game itself on DVD.
Does the pc version come on a disk with the DLCs? or are the DLCs on a code? thank you
It comes without the DLCs. The PC version comes with a CD and a code. The game is in the CD, but you'll have to look on the internet on how to install it with no need to download the game from Steam and save time, if your network is crappy. Once downloaded/installed, download the DLCs directly from steam, with the code.
this game is a STEAM game or its a normal game?
You can redeem it on steam. If it takes 14hrs to download, then your internet is way too slow.
Does the PC disc have the code in a paper or in the disk? I don't have DVD reader and the disc version is cheaper than the PC download code. Thanks
Yes, it has the code in a paper! It will also automatically seek out Steam if you have it on your computer to download to your Steam library. I highly recommend going this route.
Can the scroll wheel move left and right?
The wheel clicks left and right so I suppose you could program it to the arrows.
Does this mouse work on Mac? I would assume so, but it only mentions Windows operating systems in the description.
Yes it does now. Logitech released drivers for Mac a little while ago. Works fringe for me on my MBP.
Does this mouse have the same clicking issue as the G500. i.e Sometimes it doesn't register a click, sometimes it double or triple clicks.
The base G500 had problems that the G500s has, in my experience, corrected. Especially regarding the mouse-wheel/middle-mouse button problem. Still not as good as the G5, but it's worked well for me so far.
I ordered this G500 mouse and it is making a high pitched tone that is giving me a headache after 4 hours of use. Return or try to replace?
I'd replace it. If had one for several weeks which I use for about 10 hours per day. It's been great so far with no humming noise!
Odd question but how loud are the button clicks for this mouse? I.e. would it annoy anyone sleeping in the same room as you? Or one room over?
no the button clicks are normal. Be advised though that with any mouse in a high intensity clicking game (Diablo for one) the clicking can become problematic. One thing to be advised about is the mouse wheel. This puppy can spin fast and when you have it do measured option it can get really loud. Without the measured option on though it is noiseless. Side buttons and top buttons are near silent.
Can I use the Logitech G13 keypad with the Logitech G500s mouse? Looking to program keys on G13 and buttons on G500s to be "macros" or keystrokes.
I have that exact setup, and you can program the g-keys individually using Logitech's gaming software across multiple Logitech peripherals. It doesn't matter if you have a G1 on the G13 and a G1 on the mouse, when you program them, they are programmed based on what device the key is physically on. So you can program G1 on the G13 to execute a macro, and G1 on the mouse to emulate a function key, for example.
does the button on the side with the red dot do anything on this one? g500 it was just a dead button
By default it's just a generic programmable button. I set it to act as the mouse wheel click, because I don't like clicking the mouse wheel. You can set it to practically anything you want through the software though, like keystrokes or macros. Hope that helps!
Any weight balance issue? The G500 had a "floating center weight" that shifts and tug the mouse as you glide it, does the G500s suffers this? Thanks.
I dont notice anything like that. The mouse uses a cartridge of weights to adjust the weight. I don't use any of them, as the mouse is fairly heavy compared to my last mouse.
Is there any REAL problems with the mouse right now? because i heard of problems back in early 2013 about this mouse and I want to know if it's fixed.
If you can hear 15kHz frequencies, you may hear a high-pitched whine from the mouse when not moving it. This is due to some engineering problems with the ceramic capacitors used in the mouse.
Would this be a good mouse for playing League of Legends? Looking to purchase it as a gift.
Yes. I think it would be great for playing League of Legends!
Is this game easy enough to pick up and play? My son is 6, loves WWE, but I'm not sure if this is too advanced for him.
This game is easy for anyone to play. I'm sure he will love it once he plays the game.
dose this game as a storymode like the other one's
This doesn't have a story mode where you can create (or choose an existing) wrestler. It has Universe mode, which I am not enthused with. It is like just playing different shows building up to different main events. Different matches with different wrestlers for each card. Of course, it seems to be the same opponents for weeks on end.
Is Ultimate Warrior on this game, and can you play as him? I've read contradictory-sounding things...
Yes, he is an unlock able character when you complete the wrestlemania challenges. There also seems to another ultimate warrior you can purchase
in the storymode do you HAVE TO DO THINGS to move on in the story line
Yes you have to to be able to go on harder levels.
what type of story mode does it have and to go on in the story do you have finsh task to go on
You relive 30 years of wrestlemania & to finish each era you will have different objectives to complete inorder to continue but there are some that are optional. If you're like me that loves to collects trophies/achievements, then you might want to try to every objective because there is a achievement/trophy in doing so. But like i said some are optional while others are mandatory. I hope this answers your question
Will there be a Game of the Year edition released with all DLC included on the disc?
I'm not sure, I haven't heard anything about it
Is there only male Wrestlers?
No
Is the commentary in this game as good as those hereby found in SVR 2006 or better?
The commentary is terrible, plain and simple.
is sheamis on the game
Yup, hes in there.
is it cool
This game was well done and it is cool I think you will love it.
Can you take the fight outside of the wresting ring area into the stands?
You can take the fight outside the wrestling ring but not into the stands.
The game worked at the beginning, then I had to update my xbox for xbox and the game is unrecognized disk. please help other games work fine.
Hey bud, you may need to un install and re install the game. Sometimes updates delete cc files on accident.
Is Cincara on 2k14 or 15?
Sin Cara is in 2k14 most likely 15 as well
can you compete in online battle royals
No
Does this have online VS? Also, can you do 4 player online matches?
Probably, I didn't really play the online yet myself, I'm sure other people know the answer, I just basically reviewed it based on the gameplay, animations, speed, graphics, roster, features, controls etc. based on my opinion, I don't know much about the online aspect even though I do have XBOX Live but the really cool part of this game if you have XBOX Live that I do know is downloading the created wrestlers that people made that aren't in the game, that's pretty awesome and I like that, of course its better if they make them in the game but if they don't you can download peoples creations but I didn't really play online myself and from what I hear about the new WWE 2K15 at least the XBOX 360 version that just came out is that it's really not impressive at all even though people had high hopes for it cause the roster is smaller plus they didn't really make much improvements and they took out other features and only improved on a couple things so 2K15 lost more than it gained this year I have read on the XBOX 360 anyways, the only really good thing about it is the addition of Sting which is awesome of course cause he's a legend and really popular but supposedly they are going to have more improvements for the XBOX ONE and PS4 Versions when those versions come out soon and they want everyone to buy a new system which is kindof sad, in my view if they put out a new game they should make it as good as possible on all systems or not even release it so 2K14 is probably better to buy if you have a 360 and not a XBOX ONE or PS4 in my view plus it's way cheaper now in comparison and you can download created versions of Sting anyways and all the other packs of wrestlers that you can buy so the roster can be really big with a lot of legends and current guys, no game has everyone that you want but 2K14 comes pretty close roster wise, hopefully 2K15 will be better on the new systems cause I heard it's underwhelming on the 360 but 2K14 is alright, good roster, lots of features but the movements of the wrestlers, controls, speed, gameplay etc. TO ME could be a lot better like the N64 games they had a lot better gamplay to me, if they could make modern day versions of wrestling games with a grapple system like No Mercy or Wrestlemania 2000 from the N64 it would be AWESOME!
how many gb do you need to play this game
None all you need is 8 mb to save game
is there a multi-player mode?
Yes and coop
Should I buy WWE 2K14 or WWE 2K15 for the Xbox 360?
2k15
The game worked at the beginning, then I had to update my xbox for xbox and the game is unrecognized disk. please help other games work fine
My son has updated his Xbox and his game still works. I think that you need to contact Xbox Customer Support.
Hi, Can I use this in India?
You certainly can.but only if your in India at the same time.
Does the xbox one only support hdmi?
Yes. It only supports HDMI. Good news for you though. There are adapters out there that might allow you to convert to Component if need be. Just Google search, HDMI to Component(or whatever you want).
How large is the Hard drive for xbox standard system?
The hard drive is 500gb though you will have less space than that to store your items for the system uses some of the memory for its' default items. You will have more than 400gb of space, closer to 425.
Does this come with a controller?
Yes, you will get one wireless controller and Kinect system with the Xbox one.
does it play blue ray
yes it does play Blu-ray but you have to download it first from the app store annoying but worth it
How long until they fix (patch-update) the backwards compatibility to allow xbox 360 discs ?
so far they have not released anything about making the games backwards compatible. Sadly to say I am pretty sure they aren't going to make them backwards compatible.
Can you use the Kinect from Xbox 360 on the Xbox One?
To my knowledge, no. The Xbox One kinect has a proprietary plug and is more advance then the 360 Kinect. The 360 Kinect lack many of the advances of the new Kinect and I don't know what the plug for the 360 Kinect is so I don't even know if you could hook it to the Xbox one if you wanted.
I travel the world working on cruise lines. AKA no constant internet. Can I get a clear answer for offline gaming. Will all disc based games work offline?
The only games that will not play without a internet is online only games like titan fall and plants vs zombies plants warfare. Any game that has to connect to a server will not work. All other games disc based games will work like assassin cred and call of duty those games.
what is smartglass
It is a app that u can download to phone to control or enhance gameplay on console.
Does the Xbox one include any Kinect based game like the Xbox 360 with Kinect did (I believe it had Kinect Adventures)?
Mine did not, that was when they came out though
Does this work on the PC?
The drivers just came out today, so you can now use it too for PC.
if it comes with cable, can we use it when the xb1 controller supports pc?
This controller (via USB for now) can be used with Windows 7 and Windows 8. Divers available here: http://majornelson.com/2014/06/05/pc-drivers-for-the-xbox-one-controller-available-now/
how is the D-pad of xbox one controller as compared to ps3 controller better or equivalent or much better for fighting games like mortal khombat ?
If you're playing a charge character or shoto, xbox control is better, if you're playing a hybrid/rush then the PS3 control is slightly better. The difference in quality for fighting games isn't huge. (Unlike the 360 one which I feel is worthless for fighting games).
So there is an Army base here in Hawaii, why won't it ship here,
I don't know but the listing is just for an XBOX One wireless controller no plug and charge kit.
what size is the cable?
I think the cable is 9 feet
Do we have to have an extra wireless receiver to use on PC like xbox 360 controller
No
what is the best for Forza 5
I'm not sure what your asking, I would definitely get that play n charge kit, I have 2, they are easily worth it, but as for best all controllers are the same so that doesn't matter just as long as new that will more affect your game as opposed to an old one with sticky buttons and such, old triggers and a lot of use got me to buy a new controller. But rechargeable batteries are a no brainer. As for Forza that's my favorite game and still one of my daily drivers, but you should get away from buying actual copies as games are getting cheaper all the time and that's a first you that game that ever came out on Xbox one so pick it up cheap could be good but I prefer to have a digital copy. You can pick up a used copy of the game store for really cheap if you prefer an actual copy as that title is extreamly cheap now, do not buy new.
Can you use the battery pack from an Xbox 360 controller in the Xbox One controller?
No
I'm new to all this, why do I need a play and charge kit?
You don't have to buy batteries for the controller, it's really convinient to have this and charge the controller during downtime.
Does the Controller + Play and Charge kit allow you to charge the battery while unplugged from the controller?
No
what is special about the day one edition?
The Day One Edition includes a code for a "Day One" achievement for your Xbox Live Gamertag. The controller that comes with it also has the words, "DAY ONE 2013" printed in the middle of it (you can see it in the pictures). Other than that it's the same as the regular Xbox One. P.S.: Since it includes a code for an achievement, if you go with the Day One Edition, make sure you get it new as it will probably be redeemed if you get it used.
What games come with the Day One Edition?
None
in the details it said the it doesn't come with the converter do I need that to play to console and what is the converter
If you live in the US and buy from Amazon it will come with everything you need to get up and running in minutes
can it be turned on its side like the xbox 360 can. or does it have to be kept flat like in th pictures
Has to be flat
does it play bluray
Yes.
Does it come with warranty?
Yes it does
Are these Day One Edition just manufactured or are they from Nov. ?
Nov
does it come with warranty? and can you play minecraft the reason im asking is because i saw a message somewhere , someone said that you cannot
The factory warranty is, per Microsoft's page: "Warranty Period" for Xbox One, means 1 year from the date You purchased it; and for Accessories, means 90 days from the date You purchased it. Minecraft for the Xbox One was released on September 5th, 2014.
Hello is this item works with 220 v Electrion or 110 v help pla
110 v
If I was to buy the used like new day one edition will I still be able to get the day one achievement?
Yes, you will still receive the achievement. It's a little QR code that you scan into the Kinect.
Is it possible to use this controller in a PC using the microsoft receptor as previous xbox controller?
Microsoft has just released the official PC drivers for the Xbox One controller. http://majornelson.com/2014/06/05/pc-drivers-for-the-xbox-one-controller-available-now/?linkId=8424381
Does it include a micro usb cable?
No.
Using this for PC, which will require the micro USB to always be connected. Will I have any need for batteries at all?
I just plugged mine in to check, and the answer is no. Mine is powered up and functional with my battery pack out.
Seeing as you can use this for PC now, how is the Xbox One controller vs the 360 controller?
A massive upgrade ergonomically. The buttons feel more mechanical and precise and the joysticks have a really nice texture to the top of them. The triggers are a little bigger and the battery pack no longer sticks out of the controller, everything is internal. Honestly a complete upgrade.
Now that PC support is official, is this compatible with the "Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows"? Using both, will my PC recognize it wirelessly?
The Xbox One controller can only currently be used via Micro USB cable on PC.
if i connect this controller to my pc using a micro usb to usb cable, will it send data or just charge the controller?
Button presses (user inputs) and rumble feedback are examples of data that is sent to and from the controller. Wired controllers inherently have less input latency than wireless. The wireless Xbox 360 controller would only send charge power to the controller over USB and not data. You'd have to get a wired Xbox 360 controller if you wanted to decrease the latency in your gaming experience. As for the Xbox One controller, according the official support page, "When the charge cable is attached, the wireless controller converts to a wired controller." - http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/connect-charge-cable-to-controller And according to the IGN wiki, "When you plug a micro-USB cable into the controller for wired play the internal radio is shut off and all data is transmitted through the wire." - http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/Xbox_One_Controller
does it come with the cable
No
Does this come with rechargable batteries, and if not, which ones should I order?
No it doesn't, I recommend the Nyko brand ones. They're just as good as the Microsoft ones.
what is included in the package? just the controller or there is also the usb cable to connect to PC?
Its just the controller, you have to buy the usb separately :/.
I have some Micro USB's, so do I need to buy a charging pack for this?
Yes you do and you can't use your USB's it must be the USB that the charging pack comes with I just tried myself and it wasn't charging but I guess its kind of good because the one it comes with tells you when it's done charging
Does This include the Expansion
Yes, it has the conquerors expansion
Does this have campaign mode?
Yes this has the campaign mode

As far as free play? Yes. You choose up to I think 6 different nations to be allies or enemies, you chose your starting location and you choose the difficulty. Is that what you mean?

There is a setting on Steam, that allows you to play offline. I think if you choose the game and Polk around on Steam's settings you can find it, plus Steam has that question and answer on their website.
can you download it on two seperate computers and play each other with only one purchase?
No, it only works on 1
Is there a suggested resolution at which to play the game?

I have the old AoE2, but want to play against my wife. If we put the HD version on her computer will we be able to connect or do we need HD on both?
You should be able to connect, Ive played online and I doubt everyone one the people have the HD version

No persistent internet connection DRM for Wolfenstein: The New Order. Bethesda Softworks announced that the game will use Steam DRM. You will need to be online to activate the game and to run the initial setup process the first time you start the game, but you can play the game offline afterward.

Only single player.

http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/01/wolfenstein-the-new-order-pc-system-and-console-space-requirements-announced/ PC System Requirements: - 64-bit Windows 7/Windows 8 - Intel Core i7 or equivalent AMD - 4 GB System RAM - 50 GB free HDD space - GeForce 460, ATI Radeon HD 6850 - High Speed Internet Connection - Steam account and activation required

which of these video cards will run this game? Sapphire Flex AMD Radeon HD 6450, XFX AMD Radeon HD 6450 2GB,Radeon R7 240 2GB or other ones
All these work well as long as you update the drivers. I use a XFX AMD RADEON 6450 2 GB, WORKS GREAT.
This game work in windows xp 32 bits system?
No
Will this game work with a joystick?
I can't say "yes" with absolute authority- SINCE I NEVER GOT THE DAMN GAME TO WORK ON MY COMPUTER- but previous Windows-based versions of Wolfenstein worked with a joystick, so I would guess that this one would, too.

that is what I have and it works beautifully. Just remember the system requirements for this including i7, big graphics card, etc.
THIS WORK WITH WINDOWS XP 32 BITS?

A web site you join to play Wolf and others. You don't het Wolf with this buy.
Is this online multiplayer coop?
The developers have made very clear several months ago that this is a strictly singleplayer story.
is this the full game for this price seems to low of price?
It's the full price and game. It's not entirely terrible if you get for Xbox One or PS4. It's not bad on Xbox 360 or PS3, just the graphics have been severely dumbed down. The story and gameplay are what really matter.
Is this 720p or 1080p resolution?
The game is 720p on the PS3.
Is this an open world game? Like say gta or far cry? Or is it just straight forward missions?
Each level is it's own mission, you have to complete each of the level's to move on to the next.
How much storage space do I need on my PS3 for this?
8 GB Hard Drive Space
How many hours does the campaign take, ballpark
Roughly 24 to 28 hours
is this 1 or 2 player
Game is only single player
Is there any difference between the PS3 version and any other platform?
not that im aware of its the same game for each of the consoles it is on and there is no online multiplayer
How many dics this game has? Heard X-Box 360 has four. Just wondering. . .
I had it for the Playstation 3 only had one disc wad fun game
the doom beta code that comes with the game, do you need the game to play the doom beta?
no
does this game have multiplayer mode?
No
Does this case stack all the games on top of eachother or seperated on "pages"?
The 3 discs are stacked together on a single spindle. All the discs in my copy were in perfect condition, so storing the discs together like this seems to be OK.
Does this come with the Doom Beta? I thought that was only if you pre-ordered the game
I ordered this item twice and both times got NO Beta code!!!
Is there a single player mode that doesn't require an internet connection?
You do not need an internet connection for the single player.
How much HD space does the game need in XBox 360?
Hello Himasagar :) You need 16GBs. You can also buy a flash drive and extend the memory that you currently have in your Xbox 360. That's what my husband did. Good luck! Jessica.
System specs for PC?
According to the information, this game requires an Intel 7 series or better to operate. I purchased the game without know the required equipment. I wasn't prepared to spend the additional monies to bring my system up to par...( in excess of 400.00) so, I plan on selling it back to Amazon since places like Game Stop etc. do not buy PC games anymore.
Which disc do I load first or all 4
Start with disc 1 and then follow the instructions on the screen
What is the area code for the game? Is there a PAL region code?
Mine is the nsta USA version. I've heard the one in Germany removed all references to Nazi's. I think that's a PAL region. But mine is for the US and think it has regional restrictions.
the game is in Spanish language version ?
No, it's in English
Why is it rated M?
There are a few sex scenes that don't show private parts, and cursing.
I have a feeling its a really dumb question to ask, but does it come in the original box of the headset or another box? Im just kinda curious
I bought mine clearly marked as "manufacturer refurbished" and they came in a white box (non descriptive). All of the instructions, cables, and parts were included and each were in plastic bags, but there was nothing that was branded, as far as the packaging goes.
is there a warranty on these? and also how do i know if these are authentic headsets?
Refurbished products carry a 90 day warranty. These are authentic headphones that have been refurbished.
Does this come with the bluetooth wireless chat adapter as shown in the photo?
Yes it come a with a wireless adapter for an Xbox 360 controller.
How well would this work with an iPhone? Call answer/end/siri button? Track forward/back buttons? Stereo for music, mono(both ears) for calls?
The xp 400's do not allow music over bluetooth, only calls. You can pair the head set with your phone. You can answer calls and end them from the head set. The calls do come through on both ears, and I have never found ay way to use siri
Will this work with bluetooth on Alienware Alpha console while playing WOW's or on PC while Skyping?
It might work with Bluetooth but is designed for Xbox not PC gaming
How would I connect the xp400 transmitter to the XBOX 360 e console since it does not have an optical audio port?
You can run the audio through your TV..use the optical out on the TV.
Would it work on a Xbox One?
I think you need to buy an Xbox one adapter. I only used this for my xbox 360.
Is there anyway to disable the auto shutoff"feature"? It's my biggest gripe with this headset.
Yeah - get the cable and forgo true wireless - LOL! Wish there was something else, but that little puck shuts off whenever it feels like it. It isn't just when there is no voice activity like TB will try to tell you, mine used to shut off in the middle of me speaking - before I said to heck with it and started using the cable from my old x32s
My wife and i both game, can i connect two of these to one Xbox one?
I'm pretty sure the Xbox One only has 1 optical port in the back of the Xbox. But I think you can daisy chain them. Plug the Optical cable from the "in" port of one transmitter into the "out" port of the 2nd transmitter. Then plug the Optical cable from the "in" port of the 2nd transmitter into the optical port of the Xbox One. You guys both should get surround sound with no problems. Have fun wreckin noobs.
What's the difference between this one and the black one that says "Pro"? Is this for American cartriges?
You get to create your own power saves on the pro version. The bad part is that they both don't play a lot of games unless try were update recently. I tried pokemon x, animal crossing new leaf, and donkey kong. Only donkey kong workerd.
Does this work on 3ds games on the 2ds system?
Yes, all games that the 2ds can play are compatible with the 3ds, thus it will edit if the game is supported.
What's the difference between this one and the black one that says "Pro"? Is this for American cartriges?
They are the same! Action replay simply rebranded the same device for USA with the word PRO. This device is TRULY awesome. Saving 700 hour play file of Animal Crossing to my PC was a relief!
Does it work on pokemon omega ruby/alpha sapphire?
A little late, but absolutely. Just make sure to make use of the back-up save feature included and listen to any notes listed on individual codes, such as the TM/HM one.
will it work for samurai warriors chronicles?
it works in all the games if not update xD
Does this allow to clone pokemon?
Yes, it does, but there is a process. If you don't know already it's best to youtube it.
Is this article compatible with eurozone games...?
Yes, once I bought one and it was from Us so it didn't match with my Gamecard because I'm from Europe so I asked datel so switch to European and they did it. I hope I could help.
Can you get legendary pokemon like mew in Pokemon y
There is a way with this device but there is a trick to it. First you need to use the code for 999 maser balls. Next you need to use the code wondercard pokemon modifier or wondercard shiny pokemon modifier if you want the pokemon to be shiny. Next when you are in game you have to throw away the number of master balls equal to the national dex number of the pokemon you want. For example if you wanted a bulbasaur then you would throw away 1 masterball, or if you wanted Mew then you would throw away 151 masterballs. After that you talk to the lady inside the pokemon center and she will give you your wondercard pokemon.
does this device allow you to use cheats in a traditional sense? as in like the kind that modifies the raw code and memory address and stuff?
No, this is only for modifying saves, and only what is available from the codejunkies website.
Is there a mac version?
No dear customer
Do you need to have Windows programming as well on your Mac? It won't let me download Origin because I don't have Windows...
You don't need windows. The game has Mac version. Go and download Origin, then find your game and type in your key number. The game will be installed automatically.
I've seen a disturbing amount of negative reviews for this. Is there any common denominator like older computers/operating systems...
The biggest problem is that their downloading instructions are super unclear and outdated. After hours I was able to download the game on to my computer which is a brand new Mac. (I don't know if pc has less problems with it) however I will also tell you that once I finally got it downloaded, I could only get the base game to play. Neither of the expansion packs work because I have the "wrong code" I have to say that personally for me (while I love the game) downloading it was very difficult... I have a brand new laptop so I don't think it is that... Hope that helps!
Did anyone else only have trouble downloading Late Night? If so, did you ever get it to download properly?
The whole download did not work for me
If I brought this game first can will I be able to download the sims 3 generations?
Yes! That is exactly what I did!(:
do you need to already have original sims 3 before downloading this ?
No
After updating my system's software on my macbook pro, The Sims game I had downloaded disappeared. How do I re-download it?
Contact Origin directly for assistance. When downloading you had to 1st register with them, so they have all your games saved. Give it a try, hope this helps.
How can i download it? I can't see it in the game library.
Make sure you have an Origin account. When you open up Origin you look on the top left of your Mac screen and you should see where it says "Games" when you click on it you will see where it says "Redeem product code". Type in the code that they provided you with after buying the game on Amazon. Then you'll find it under the "My Games" section on Origin click on the game and it should give you the option to download. Hope this helps.
After I buy this will I be able to add expansion packs to it?
Yes, my daughter has added 3 expansion packs without a issue or glitch. Happy Gaming (:
How do you open it so you can actually play it?
You have to have Origin - EA's game launcher.
Is this the original one you need to have installed for the other versions of sims3?
Yes.
Do you need to have Windows programming as well on your Mac? It won't let me download Origin because I don't have Windows...
You don't need windows. The game has Mac version. Go and download Origin, then find your game and type in your key number. The game will be installed automatically.
I've seen a disturbing amount of negative reviews for this. Is there any common denominator like older computers/operating systems...
The biggest problem is that their downloading instructions are super unclear and outdated. After hours I was able to download the game on to my computer which is a brand new Mac. (I don't know if pc has less problems with it) however I will also tell you that once I finally got it downloaded, I could only get the base game to play. Neither of the expansion packs work because I have the "wrong code" I have to say that personally for me (while I love the game) downloading it was very difficult... I have a brand new laptop so I don't think it is that... Hope that helps!
Did anyone else only have trouble downloading Late Night? If so, did you ever get it to download properly?
The whole download did not work for me
If I brought this game first can will I be able to download the sims 3 generations?
Yes! That is exactly what I did!(:
do you need to already have original sims 3 before downloading this ?
No
After updating my system's software on my macbook pro, The Sims game I had downloaded disappeared. How do I re-download it?
Contact Origin directly for assistance. When downloading you had to 1st register with them, so they have all your games saved. Give it a try, hope this helps.
How can i download it? I can't see it in the game library.
Make sure you have an Origin account. When you open up Origin you look on the top left of your Mac screen and you should see where it says "Games" when you click on it you will see where it says "Redeem product code". Type in the code that they provided you with after buying the game on Amazon. Then you'll find it under the "My Games" section on Origin click on the game and it should give you the option to download. Hope this helps.
After I buy this will I be able to add expansion packs to it?
Yes, my daughter has added 3 expansion packs without a issue or glitch. Happy Gaming (:
How do you open it so you can actually play it?
You have to have Origin - EA's game launcher.

I recently had to give my GT5 disc back to my friend and was wondering if GT6 was worth the extra 20 bucks. And is it more realistic then GT5?
Play Station has stopped supporting the on line races that they used to provide every month in GT5. I would buy a used GT6 game if you like the time trials. GT6 did not provide any extra races on the online part like GT5 did other than stupid time trials. I thought it was easier to tune your cars in GT5 and had over 700 cars that I owned. GT6 is harder to earn lots of money and there isn't many cars that you can win. (maybe 20) I haven't played it in several months as I got bored with it, something that didn't happen with GT5. If you have a large garage full of cars with GT5 then it would be good to own it again if you can buy it at a decent price. The racing dynamics are not noticeably better with GT6 and some think it is actually worse than GT5. I know Sony is still tweaking it to make it better like they did with GT5. It might be worth while to get it if you can buy it cheap. Certainly not $50 like I paid for it when it came out. Maybe 25 to 30 dollars would be reasonable. Hope this helped you.
Is this NTSC or PAL?
This particular one is NTSC. Most, if not all U.S releases use NTSC. Here is a link to a handy list http://shop.sandbag.uk.com/OneGiantLeap/PALNTSCInfo.html
cAN i USE THIS GAME ON A PLAYSTATION 4?
No you cannot. No backwards compatibility
cAN i USE THIS GAME ON A PLAYSTATION 4?
No
If I install GT6, can I still play GT5 on the same machine? I'd still like to race the awesome cars I earned in GT5 even if only in GT5.
yes, they are independent games
Are there more cars in it than Gran Turismo 5?
Yes
Does this version offer wheel support, specifically the Driving Force Wireless Wheel?
Here are the supported racing wheels for this game: THRUSTMASTER T500 RS THRUSTMASTER T300 RS Driving Force GTG27 Racing Wheel G25 Racing Wheel Driving Force ProGT FORCE Driving ForceDriving Force EX
I have GT5 and want to use my GT5 garage full of cars on GT6. Is that possible? Will I be able to do on line "Seasonal" races to rack up credits?
You can not transfer your cars from GT5 to GT6. The physics between the two games is different making it implausible to transfer your cars. They would not work correctly.
can it be played in offline single player mode??
No. This game is the worst. I can't do anything with it.
is it better than GT5??does it has too much difference??please help me to choose..thnx
Well it's more of the same. Same format, but better cars graphics! And Yes it's better!

Well it's more of the same. Same format, but better cars graphics! And Yes it's better!
it really has all of the mgs games from mgs1 to mgs4? including snake eater?
Yes it has all of them. The game has a digital code for MGS1 that you can download from the PSN, it has the HD versions of MGS2, MGS3, and MGS: Peace Walker. The MGS3: HD edition also includes the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake for the MSX. And, finally...the collection includes MGS4. The only games that are not here are MGS: Portable Ops, the MGS Ac!d games, and the NES versions of Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2.
Does it include MGS: Twin Snakes?
It does include MGS 1 which is what twin snakes is a remake of, but not the actual twin snakes game. So to answer your question, no.
I thought that older games, such as MGS2, were not backward compatible with the PS3. Will ALL these games work on the PS3 Super Slim?
It is made to be used for ps3
If I buy this game today, will I be able to download the content or did the codes expire?
I believe the codes wont expire, they are codes for the PSN Network and will let you download Metal Gear Solid 1 and some extra's, but problem is if you aren't using an american account it wont work, so if you need to, make an american account and then go onto the PSN Network and input the code :) It will let you download it onto your american account user on PS3 :)
I see it has MGS 3 HD. Is that snake eater or subsistence?
It is Subsistence as per other reviews with the fully controllable camera but does not come with Snake vs Monkey minigame. Plus you get the downloadable camos, MG 1 and 2 Solid Snake from the Famicom, and other extras.
Which region is this game in? R1?
Yes, it is. As most games sold for North America.
Does this Have MGS VR Missions?
Yes
which to buy, Legacy or HD Collection? do I need both? differences? thanks in advance ~ from: a noob.
Legacy has the HD Collection in it. The HD Collection is Metal Gear Solid 2, 3 and Peace Walker. Legacy also has 1 and 4, extra content and a neat art book thing. Legacy is a lot harder to find too, so it might be extra valuable in a few years, who knows.
Would this game work on my PS3 (I live in the UK)? Not sure if it would be region locked or not.
According to an article on Kotaku published in 2012, "the PS3 is usually entirely region-free [for games]...any publisher to region-block a PS3 game is a strange decision;" (http://kotaku.com/5923821/meet-the-first-ever-region-locked-ps3-game). Also, the Wikipedia page for region locked PS3 games only lists two games: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Region-locked_PlayStation_3_games. There IS a catch, though: it's possible you might have NTSC/PAL TV incompatibilities (see http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/07/ps3-is-region-free-but-theres-a-hi-def-catch/). The solution is to use an HDMI cable and play in at least 720p.
Do you need to download patches for both of the included discs?
im not sure. the game has been tested and it does work.
Does it come with a HDMI cable
No it does not. It comes with one wire control, av cables, and the ps3.
ship internationally?
We unfortunately cannot ship internationally.
Does it come with a controller?
Yup it did white one been playing diablo 3 r.o.s. like crazy.
What is included in the box?
The consule, controller which was white also, and the power cable. Also there is a home cable. It was used so when I got it there was dirt around some parts of the outside. It only took 5 Seconds to clean it off. But besides that the consule works perfectly and never overheated. So I recommend it. :)
Is This a Japanese,American, or European Model?
American I wish I could put photos up to show you it run great and it's 500GB just like the PS4 I love mine
does it come with its original box?
Mine did, I don't know if this was a retailer or private owner.
The game is dubbed and subtitled in Portuguese ?. It's what I want to send my son in Brazil
Yes. It has an option for Portugese audio. Being Brazil dominates most classes in mma it would be very disappointing if it didn't.
So I preordered this game but I never received a code or anything to unlock Bruce Lee. Any suggestions??
check your email that you gave amazon. I just got mine earlier.
Can you create your own fighter for the campaign
Yes
is this the one with Bruce Lee?
Yes u have to buy him in the dlc
does this game allow two players (in the same room) to play each other with two controllers on your local xbox. like the orginal xbox did.
Yes it does
Does this game work with Kinect, I haven't seen any comments about it.
Nope not yet at least I'm sure in the next installment they will somehow use gameface with connect that would be sick
This is my first time pre-ordering online. I live in Hawaii, will I get my game on the exact date of release or will you ship it on that date?
You will not get it on release day. From Amazon release day shipping info "Note: Release-Date Delivery isn't available to Amazon Lockers, Alaska, Hawaii, international destinations, P.O. Boxes, or APO/FPO addresses." Link -
Can you jump in this game?
No jumping. Hurdling over objects.
Is this game appropriate for my 12 yo son? Haven't looked into it yet.
My answer is always, "Would you take your child to this if it was a movie?" The content description is: "Blood, Intense Violence, Nudity, Strong Language, Strong Sexual Content, Use of Drugs and Alcohol". If you wouldn't sit through a movie with your child and that sort of content, then don't buy them a 40+ hour game with that content. Personally, I would not purchase this game for any child under 16, and not even all 16 year olds (some are immature). If it's helpful, the store policy and most major video game stores would prohibit your son from buying this game on his own without you present. (M Rated games require 17 yrs old to buy independently)
Can you play with your friends in co op on a private server?? or is it open world PvP ( Player V Player ) only?
There is no Coop mode in Watchdogs. After you complete Act 1, Mission 4, you unlock the ability to use the PvP function. This enables you to play several different types of side missions against other people online. I will say that it can be kind of distracting when you are playing a mission then all of a sudden you realize you are being hacked by someone who has jumped on your game but it offers a challenge unlike other games out there. Here is a link to an IGN article about the multiplayer experience on Watch Dogs which should give you a better understanding of the types of multiplayer missions there are. http://www.ign.com/wikis/watch-dogs/Multiplayer
So you can just play straight campaign even if you have an Xbox live membership? Or are you forced to play online?
You can just play campaign if you wish. You can turn off the online aspects.
the game is digital download?
I bought the disc you'd have to check the Xbox store. It's likely there.
Is this watch dogs a disk or download
Hi leo, it's both.... you can buy the disk or download for Xbox One and also Xbox 360. http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/watchdogs#fbid=-nNsNr5aBkK
Is there anything included in the box that would discourage buying it used (Xbox One version)?
No. The box includes a pamphlet that has information about uplay but nothing important.
I own the 360 version; is there any new material on the Xbox One version, or is it pretty the same except for improved graphics? Thanks!
It's pretty the same except for improved graphics
Does this game require a xbox gold membership or can I still play the game fully with out the membership?
It has the campaign which is single which you dot need live but the multiplayer you do. You do need live to get updates on the game though. So to get the best experience while playing this game, I would get Xbox live but you don't need it for the campaign part.
This is my first time pre-ordering online. I live in Hawaii, will I get my game on the exact date of release or will you ship it on that date?

Is this game as good on Xbox one as it was on the 360?
Better! Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag is an amazing open world game, especially on the Xbox one.
Should i buy this game? I honestly suck at games, I give up easily on timed stuff or too difficult, but this game looks interesting
I'm 66 years old and find Xbox games a great reality escape. I started Assassins Creed with Assassins Creed II and worked my way up. I love the "Black Flag" edition, but it can be challenging at first. The graphics are breath taking and game play a real challenge. Although, I'm not a youngster with razor sharp reflexes, I do enjoy the Assassins Creed franchise and hope you will also. Good luck and have fun!
does this game have local co-op or couch co-op? which ever means 2 players for you guys thats its not online...thanks
There is no co-op.
Can you turn off the strong language? Other words, censor it to play in front of younger kids.
No. There is one dialog, but you can turn the voice audio off, and use subtitles. There are also seven available languages in case you speak another (english, french, spanish, german, italian, russian and portugese). The other option would be to use headphones. The dialog is quite important for the story, but also for the purposes of gameplay, as advice from the other characters is important - for instance, advice from crew when sailing can be very useful !
The game is multi language?
Yeah, the in game menu has several spoken language options as well as subtitle options...
Can I play this on the PS4?
this one is for Xbox one but you can get it for PlayStation 4.
is the sexual content strong in this game or mild,
no, it is just suggested adult theme behind it. The language can be rough though. There are a few 'F" bombs scattered throughout it.
Should I buy this game? I honestly suck at games, I just give up very easy. This game looks interesting though but I don't want to waste money
Yes
Is this a digital code or the actual game disk?
Game disk
Hello, I own both systems xb1&amp;ps4 does anyone have a suggestion what system looks better or runs smoothly or are they both the same ? Please
They are both pretty much the same; just purchase it for the system with the more comfortable controller, or the one you have more friends playing on.
What does the PC Download Collector's Edition come with? I purchased it and I don't see any of the in-game exclusives, nor do I see anything sent .
Comes with the Baby Behemoth minion, Coeurl mount, Helm of Light, and Behemoth Barding, as well as a Moogle Minion and a Fat Chocobo mount which were recently released. You'll get in game mail, which you have to pick up at a mail moogle that has each item attached.
Is the collectors edition worth the extra $20? Does the helm exp bonus work whenever you want to create a new job or is it only good for a 1-time use?
The helm is level related I believe, so it works with any jobs under the level cap listed on the helmet description. Aside from that, the extra $20 is mainly cosmetic.
Does this include the base game, or do I have to purchase that seperately?
Yes its the complete base. After you dl the game and go to Square Enix and create an account and go to log in the game it dls the patches for any and all updates!
Does this come with the game itself? Or do you have to purchase the game and the CE to get it's benefits?
The CE comes with a copy of the game and the benefits. You donr have to buy the game and the CE to get the benefits. Hope this helps.
i have it for pc but would like to play on ps4. will on characters be on both or will i have to start new ones
Your character will be on both. It's tied to an account not PC/ps4
this game does require a subscription. and i went to the moogle and still can't access any of the deluxe content. not sure why, or how.
the collector edition items are adquire in game via the moggle messge. go to any place where there is a moggle message serivice, it appears at the map like a tegami or a mail sign. youy pick it then use it. presto.
I have a question, even if this is an MMO, does this have a universal goal?
Well yeah it have its own many story line. A lots of sidequest. Best of all. It will never be pay to win. Got to put some effort to get the best things.
Does buying this come with a subscription?
Purchasing the game comes with a 30 day free trial. Or at least it did when I bought the game. After that its about 15.00 dollars a month give or take. I believe you can also do a "pay as you go" using Crysta purchased on the Square Enix site but I dont know how that works.

hi, this game is free region, can i use it in a playstation from usa? thanks
You can
if i buy fifa from usa would it work in uk ps4 console
Yes, it will work. PS4 games aren't region locked.
How many simultaneous players can you play locally? 3? 4?
You can play up to 8 I'm pretty sure, however, playing more than two people is difficult and annoying because one player for each team is usually optimal.
Can you play it also in the german language?
Only English French and Spanish
Is this a NEW game? Is it sealed?
Yesss!!!!!
i 'd like to know about the wight of this ps4 ?
I don't understand your question! If you mean about the weight of the PS4, its weight is about 2.8 kg.

Does this game work with one play4 bought in canada?
I believe it does.
I've never played soccer games and don't know the current players IRL. Will I still enjoy?

Nope.

Yes
Is this 2 players or more?
Online yes, but not split screen

Hello, Is it possible to play with brazilian portuguese audio? tks...
Yes, in 'Gameplay Settings' the bottom option allows you to select your audio language between English, French, German, Mexican Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.
Does this game require an online pass to play online like previous UFC games? Also does it come with any other codes?
No. It does NOT require online play pass
Can I play this game with someone else not online? like with a second controller (ex. Fifa, COD, NHL)
Yes its two players locally
Can you watch simmed CPU vs CPU matches with this game (like in Undisputed)?
Yes
Can you play tag team? or do you have to fight against your local player 2?
There is no tag team, its only a 1v1 scenario but there is online as well
In multiplayer mode, not online, the game finishes very quickly. It is very easy to beat your opponent or to be beaten. Any solutions for this?
It depends in the difficulty playing it with a friends is a must have game ,
does this game let you play with another person offline ?? if you add another control and the other person is next to you
I believe so. I've never played against another person offline, but I believe you can as long as you have two controllers, it should work.
Does this need to be connected to internet or can I play offline.?
I don't believe you need to be connected to the internet to play.
can more than one person play this game on the same system at th e same time? thx in advance
Yes
Is this Mouse for palm handed grips or Claw handed grips?
CLAW grip mouse
Can you remap the DPI buttons to something else? I don't have a need for DPI switching.
You can! You have to install the Corsair M40 Mouse configuration program (available on their website) but you can remap it to another prebuilt command or to emulate a keystroke.
Is this a smaller mouse or is it the same size as a regular mouse?
regula size mouse.
does it work for windows 8?
The website system requirements state that it works in Windows 8. I plugged it into my surface tablet for a test, worked immediately.
is the scroll wheel free-scrolling?
If free-scrolling is the kind you can flick and it keeps spinning, then no - it's an incremental click scroll.
can i turn off the led all of THEM
Nope
Can you choose the DPI levels (I play at 750 and 1100 DPI) or are you locked into pre-set DPI levels (like 500, 1000, 2000, 4000)?
There's only 3 levels and they're preset, no granular control. The buttons right below the mouse wheel is what controls the DPI. I can't remember what the numbers were but the highest was over 1k.
My son says while playing Minecraft PVP the side buttons have like a 5 second delay that is screwing him up..any suggestions? Thanks!
Try contacting Corsair customer support if your warranty is still valid, and try another mouse and see if you have similar problems. I don't believe it's a design flaw with the mouse itself, it's either a defective unit or something is wrong with the settings on your computer, or the computer/internet is just lagging.
Does the logo glow all the time, or can it be shut off?
Yes, you are able to turn the Corsair glow off if you want through the software that you download from their website.
Is it possible to turn both the logo LED and the LED under the scroll wheel off so there are no glowing red lights?
just the logo
Is this two discs?
Yes, there are two discs. Disc 1 is the installation disc. Disc 2 is the "play" disc, meaning you have to have it in the X-Box while you are playing the game.
Is it safe to order a used one or better to buy a new one?
I've always bought new games but if I did buy a preowned game I would make sure they had a great review from them positive feed hope this helps
I have an 8 and 9 year old who has been begging for this game. As a parent I have many concerns about the content....can anyone on the forum recommend a game similar without the adult content? Thanks in advance!!
I would say no, I really didn't know how bad it was until I started playing it. The language and sexual references and actual sexual content, I feel make this game much worse than a rated R movie. The game itself and free play world are amazing, I wish you could edit the other stuff out.
is it fun?
Yes
I have two questions. 1: how much storage is required to play the game. 2: Would you get this for a person that is turning 11
8gb is required to play the game. I would get this for a 11yr old. My daughter is 13 and I just bought it for her. I think as long as the children who play this game knows right from wrong and is respectful, then it should be okay. I would buy the game from Xbox store instead of amazon. My daughters game only worked 1 day. Now I have to buy her another one. I could of returned it for an exchange of a new one but she threw away the box and label.
Say i have borrowed the game from a friend and have already downloaded the 8 gb. Would i have to download it again if i bought it here??
Hello! Thanks for your question. The best that I can tell is that you need the disc in order to play the game. So I think that as long as you download it once, you shouldn't have to re-download the game again. All you would need is the disc to play the game. Again, I am not 100% sure about this but from experience that is how it's always been. Sorry if I could not provide you with a better answer.
Is Assassin's Creed 4 a better choice than Grand Auto Theft V?
No because, there is less to do on Assassin's creed. It also has a smaller area than GTA V where as GTA V has a huge world with variety of gameplay. But this is just my opinion and I feel that kids and young teenagers should buy Assassin's creed due to GTA V having a lot of profanity in it. If GTA could tone that down then GTA V is for me a 100% fun time.
Why it is only 29$?
I don't know seems pretty cheap when I bought it I thought it was fake or something but I took a risk and everything seems pretty good works great runs great I've had no problems good game and good deal
Is this o.k. for asia region (vs u.s.a / canada
This is made for USA made consoles. So it probably wouldn't work for any other country.
Would you let a MATURE 13 year old boy play this game?
I would think of it this way. You should play it with your boy and explain things along the way. Just like would you let them watch Road warriors the movie by them selves or with you watching it with them.
the game is in Spanish?? or has this game in Spanish??
Not to my knowledge but you can google it. I saw some youtube videos where you can change the language, so do some digging.
is nuketown on it
Yes nuke town is on it. Also come with a free map pack down loan that adds 4 more multiplayer levels and a zombie level. Its a great buy.
I just bought this new, did the download on PS3 then installed it. When I go to play,only have 3 maps town/farm..where is the dlc at?thanks
DLC has to be redeemed through the psn store, even if it's the gotye. You should receive a 12 digit code to redeem for dlc, or purchase it separately in the store
Did the DLC code expire yet for the PS3 copy of Call of Duty Black Ops 2 GOTY Edition?
when i bought it the code worked so you shouldnt have a problem
Hello , Does it include the original game + A free map pack ?
It includes the game, with a code for the digital download. Yes.
Unlike the launch version, does this version include a separate code for the 1st DLC or is it included the PS3 disc? Expiration date for code?
Yea there's actually a paper and on the back comes a code for the first DLC Map pack
Will you ship to APO addresses
Yes, Thanks
Is this game in spanish? Can I change the language?
I don't know if you can change the language but I don't believe it's in Spanish. The one I got wasn't.
Is this an add-on, or the entire game WITH the add-on? In other words, do I have to buy the original game to play this?
No
Is nuke town map and extra zombie map included on the standard version or is it only on the other versions like the hardened or deluxe pack?
I think nuke town is included also
Does this game have multiplayer mode
YES , you can play this game OFF LINE , these people don't know what they are talking about. The game has game save issues , but if you disconnect your console from the internet and play it like you would any other game your game saves will work because its not going through EA's servers then to cloud saving. All of your saves will go directly to the hard drive like they are supposed to. If you get busted by a cop or just wreck your car to much and are automatically sent back to the garage , make sure you exit the garage and come back in again because the game does not save when those two things happen. Always visit a garage before shuting down your console because that is the only way to save. Just play off line to avoid losing you save game data. Also don't listed to anyone that tells you there is no off line play because there is and the game functions the exact same way as it does online except you don't have live players running around it is just the game AI drivers which is all I need because the game is still tons of fun even without the online feature. Everything you can do online , you can do off line Except race live players.
Are there more bugs with the Xbox One version Vs PS4 for the price to be cheaper? If nothing is wrong I will of course get the Xbox One version.
Hmmm I can't say anything for the ps4 version cause I only have the xbone, but the only bug I've encountered that's rather annoying is the start menu opening by itself while I'm free driving or in a race, other than that it's been pretty good and fun!
Do you need a hear drive
Not sure what a "Hear" drive is. All i have is an Xbox1 with no Kinect and it works as it should.
Have the bugs been fixed yet?
No. There have been no know patches. Unfortunately, it appears that this may not see a patch.
Can two kids play this split screen at home off line
Yes, great game. Very kid friendly also.
Is it open world?
Yes
I see there is a new version of this game which is more expensive. I wanted to get this for my 6 year old, would the original version be sufficient?
I think the original would be ok as long as your 6 year old isn't going to be devastated by the loss of an earned vehicle. The open road and easy controls do provide an excellent means of entertainment.
Does this game require the kinect to play?
This game do not require Kinect so if you don't have Kinect you will be able to use it without a problem :)
could i play offline and does it allow split screen?
Yes

No. One player or multiplayer online only.
Is this game like Hot Pursuit?
Yes. In this game you can play either as cops or the racer. Each side has their own cars and challenges.
may I use a game bought in Europe on this console? Is there any country code?
No there isn't. Its region free. However, my console abs game are from US
Does this game have a online code inside required for online play?
No, I rented it through GameFly and there was no code. Just pop the disc in and play :)
I like the structure of Hot Pursuit. Will I like this game? I'm not sure I like free roam...
It's less like the original hot pursuit from 1998 and more like the hot pursuit from 2010, whichever one it is you're referring to. While you're not consistantly selecting tracks to race on, it's more like having all the tracks combined into one seemingly cohesive environment, which you can either drive to yourself or "jump" to from your Hideout/Command Post. To be honest, it is what you want it to be; if you like more arcade-style racing where you go race to race, do that. If you want to just drive around until you find something you fancy, you can do that too. The nice thing that makes Rivals so compatable with different player types is that it allows you to make the game what you will. Don't like free roam? Don't free roam. Want to drive around challenging other racers head-to-head or messing with cops because you can? You can do that too.
Is this game open world?
Yes it is.
Is Need For Speed Rivals like Need For Speed Rivals Complete Edition?
It's the same game , just has some bonus cars added by online download.That's the only difference that i saw.
can this game only be played online? or it offline enabled too ? can i change the audio to spanish ?
Some of the game can be played offline but it requires an internet connection for a good portion as for the audio I am not sure never tried
Direction of car can be controlled by motion of joy stick ??
Do you mean the controller? No it is not controlled by the motion of your hands, and I could not find a setting for it. Controls are easy to use with the analog joystick/moveable pad on the controller yes.
Hi .Does this game(ps4 edition) support track 5.1
yes my friend I have my ps4 connected to a home theatre and it sounds amazing

what is the rating?
I don't know the official rating, but I can say from playing that the game has no foul language, nudity, or adult situations. It doesn't have blood either, though it does have cartoon-like violence (your character dies often and generally goes around eating animals). If you get it for a kid you might consider adjusting the settings to make it easier, since it can be pretty hard.
Is this the Steam version or not? Thanks!
Hi, yes :) Under the name of the game, on the top of the page -&gt; "DRM: Steam DRM"

The multiplayer is in beta right now. You can buy the beta separately to access online now, or wait until it's released for free to everyone.

Of course
Hello , good afternoon , the game that sold you sell in physical or digital ?
physical
It has language chinese?
I don't think so
have this game a espa&ntilde;ol version?
No we don't. Sorry
why does it lag so much on multyplayer? its like the ps4 cant handle the memory requirements for the size of the map?
I have noticed it lagging a lot more lately. It didnt do that before Advanced Warfare came out. It may be because of the lack of people playing it now which would result in the lack of good connections.
on the PC version you can see how many people are online and on each MP mode, can you see that on ps4?
no you cannot
Is this ps4 game supported or compatible on a 720 HD LCD TV???
Yes, mine is 720
Does this game includes the season pass to download the 4 new maps?
No
Will this version run on windows 8?
Yes, I have it running on both 8.0 and 8.1 and it runs fine!
Does it have a suggested move function like chessmaster x?
In the Train mode, on the left panel, there are seven choices for the player. The bottom one is "Show best move". It is the best move for you, the player. Houdini will then make the best choice for your computer opponent. I have tried this choice for many chess puzzles and it is correct every time.
Is there a version for the Mac in the works?
We haven't been told if there is. At some point in the future there should be, but we just don't know when. This is supposed to work with a Mac if you have Windows-emulator software. VMWare Fusion (which I believe can be downloaded online) is supposed to allow you to use Windows products on a Mac computer. You might want to research that.
Can I install the software in several computers ?
I am not sure because I only have one PC but I do know where you can find the answer. You can email Chess King support. The email address: support@chess-king.com I hope that helps! Mike :-)
will it work on windows 8?
According to the Chess King web page; all software is compatible with the Windows systems - XP thru win8. (see Paul Edvalson's comment)
will this work with windows 7
Yes it does
Does the used version of this bundle guaranteed come with the model depicted in the picture? Also, will all accessories come with it for sure?
My console came with an already used PS+ membership but Amazon replaced. Everything else was Good.
My PS3 has recently stopped working and I bought it less than a year ago. What is the warranty on this product?
The Sony warranty is 1 year. Sony offers an extended warranty for 36 months at $40 for standard or $50 for accident protection.
How do you activate the plus feature for this product?
You just have to write the code in the "Redeem codes" section of Playstation Store.
How many people can play
I believe 2.
Does the SWAP force starter pack for wii work with wii u?
Yes
What language is this game in? I recently purchased a differnt one in Spanish accidentally and I need an English version.
This one came to us as the English version. Our kids love this.
Can I use Skylanders Giants figures with this portal and game? Please answer...
You can use the figures from any skylanders game that came out before swap force did.
Does this pack come with everything I need? Do I have to purchase any extra cable, USB, portals. I'm new to sky landers so trying to understand thanks
Yes
Does the portal &amp; the usb connection cable come with the starter pack?
Yes. The portal platform with USB comes with this set.
Can you use the Swap force with the Trap team?
Dear value Amazon Customer, Thank you for your question Unfortunately, the Trap Team will not work with the Swap Force. The Trap Team only works with the new portal, however all Skylanders figures will work in the new portal Thank you for your interest and we wish this information help you.
Do you need extra fighures to finish the game?
To get from beginning to end in a linear fashion you could do it with just a hand full of figures, but there are side areas and alternate paths that would require a full compliment skylanders to take full advantage of the game.
will other skylanders work with it(as in normal skylanders and skylanders giants)?
The Skylanders from Giants and Spyros Adventure will work on the portal. The only ones that won't work are from the newest game Trap Team, it has a new portal. You can also use the old games with the Swap Force portal. I also read the portal will work on a Wii or a PlayStation, although we haven't tried it yet.
Does this work on an ipad mini?
Nope. There is a separate set.

I want to buy this bundle for Mac, but my disc drive has failed. Does the cable bundle come with a digital download option along with the disc?
I bought the disk version with the cable when it was on sale at a deep discount. All you need is the license key from the box by which you can log into your Steam account and activate the new game by entering the license key after which the latest edition (all patches included) will proceed to download to your games library. if you did use the disk, you wouldn't have all the patches and the game would patch after activation. Just using the code through steam, no drive is necessary.
Has anyone learned to play guitar proficiently with no instruction other than this game?
Yes, this will get you there. There are a bunch of videos included with it starting with the absolute basics of holding and stringing the guitar. Most people don't watch many of them, like me, and just can pick it up and go from there. You can get to be pretty decent just by working through the songs. This has more than what you need to get proficient, aka able to play but not like a pro necessarily
is this have activation key?
Activation key does come with the DVD version. It is inside the DVD case.
Is the cable supposed to be a little loose? If I open AcidMusicStudio9 and play my bass on there I kinda have to hold it to my bass so it sounds clear
No, you shouldn't have to hold it. Your female connector (spring steel clips) are probably stretched out a little.
Does it work on a macbook air?
As long as your version meets the minimum Requirements.
When you use Rocksmith, is the guitar plugged into the amp at all, or just the computere?
In order to use your guitar with Rocksmith, you do not use an amp at all. You plug the guitar to the computer with the Ubisoft Rocksmith Real Tone Cable.
Can I install the PC version on multiple computers ? I spend weekdays at my home and weekends at my girlfriends. Will I have to buy a separate licence to run on my pc and also on hers ?
Not if you have steam. Just activate it on there and you can download steam to your GFs computer. JUst bring your cable.
Does the cable plug into USB? My laptop does not have audio-in
The cable is 1/4" male jack at one end and USB at the other end.
I am not a 'gamer' &amp; a lot of the phrasing and language here is over my head, but I want to learn guitar. Is RS an option for someone over (ahem) 50?
Absolutely. I loath video games and am by no means a gamer, but I love playing Rocksmith. You can set the level for absolute beginner or advanced player. One great feature is that you have the option of picking a song and playing it over and over. With each pass, the game will get just a little more difficult and pull you closer to mastery. A second great feature is the simple arcade type game feature. Here you can play simple games that will focus on a number of technique elements including chords, scales, picking, sliding, etc. As a music student enrolled in a guitar program, I can't recommend this game highly enough.
Will this enable a person to read music and play other pieces, or do you only learn the songs included?
This game actually teaches you the cords so you could pick up other songs and play them after you get good at this game. It won't really help with "Sheet music" and music theory as much though.
I am a beginner at guitar and recently bought this game. Does anyone know if there is a tutorial section on finger posturing?
Yes there is. I knew nothing when I started with the original Rocksmith and this version is much improved. In both they show you everything even down to the names of each part of the guitar. They also have lessons on basic stuff that'll be useful in many songs you play later. I highly recommend this. You'll see results ONLY if you put in time every week. Every day would be even better.
rocksmith 2012 or 2014, $40 price difference. Is it worth the cash to get the newer version?
Honestly yes it is worth it. You get ALOT more content on the new one and the second one is more of an upgrade to the Rocksmith product rather than just a sequel. Definitely get the new one you won't regret it
Could someone suggest a good guitar to use this with? Something cheap yet not horrible and sold on Amazon? Thanks!
Epiphone SG junior is a good beginner guitar and can be bought for about $110 shipped on amazon. It's a simple light guitar with a single humbucker pickup and an easy to play low action neck.
Does it come with the guitar?
The actual game will only come with an air guitar, this guitar will only exist in your imagination and does not plug into any systems but your mind (advantage is calibration is not required and neither is tuning). For a physical guitar you can either buy the guitar and video game bundle or purchase the game and guitar separately.
how long is the cable?
7-8 foot you can get a double female and another guitar cable from a music store and go all over the house
When I am playing with my friend (on the same console but with 2 cables) can I play left handed while they play right?
Yes you can just change your settings before playing on multiplayer as long as you have it on the same console and 2 cables you should be good to go
is it lead only or can it teach me bass aswell?
It does have bass.
Is easier to use the interface on PC or is it the same with a PS3?
Its pretty easy to use on the PS3, never tried it on a PC.
Does it work in a PS4?
No as per my knowledge, but some ubisoft PS3 can be upgraded by purchasing some activation code like Assassin Creed IV, pleas see the link below http://youtu.be/q2_G6Pthje4 I hope that helped enjoy
Is this a single player only game, or can two people plug in and play together?
From what I understand two people can plug in and play on the same system. Two cables are required to do so and you cannot play online with someone.
Is there a Rocksmith 2015 Edition coming out soon? Details PLEASE!
No forseeability plans to make a 2015 Edition.
Do you have to have kinect on your xbox to use this lesson game?
No you do not have to have Kinect. However if you do it allows you to use voice to navigate the menus. I personally do not use it I just use my controller and is does not affect any of my gameplay experience.
Do I need to have a hard drive installed on my Xbox 360 to run this game? I have a version of the Xbox without the hard drive.
If your cloud has space then a hard drive would not be needed. I so far have only saved progress so that would be handled by the cloud system. If you do not wish to get a hard drive and want a physical copy of the files then saving to a flash drive inserted into the console is possible.
Can I use the front USB ports for the cables?
Yes you can
Does anyone have both the original and 2014 versions know if the Lessons are better in the 2014 than the original?
We bought my son in law both. He likes this one a lot better
Is there a left mode? I'm left-handed and have been itching to learn guitar but don't know how to go about it.
Yes, you're asked if you wasn't too play left or right handed. I'm left handed and it works perfectly fine
What elements of the game does Kinect enhance? It says it is better but not required to play with Kinect. How?
When I tried using the Kinect I found that it picked up hand motions only causing confusion. I'm sure it works better for some and I was looking forward to never having to take my hands off the guitar but it didn't work out for me.
Does the game help you tune your guitar?
Only when you're playing it. Once it's in tune, based on the quality of your guitar, it should stay tuned. To that key anyway. When I change key in the game it automatically prompts me to tune it and the tuning feature is actually quite helpful. Usually takes less than a minute with my guitar. Hope that helped.
Aside from the game and guitar is there anything else you need to purchase? I know nothing about guitars and this is a gift... is an amp required?
No amp is required, you do, however, need the cable, the cable is hooked up from guitar to xbox and the sound comes thru whatever you have hooked up to the tv, be it the speaker system or tv itself.
I have an xbox360 with only 4gb of hard drive. Can this game be played directly from the Disc without requiring game installation in the hard drive?
Yes it can. At least I never installed it. You will need memory to save of course.
What kind of switches does this keyboard use?
It's a membrane styled board. It's a great board though. Highly suggest unless you just have to get a mechanical board. You'll need to get into the Corsair Vengeance product line if you're looking mechanical.
Is this keyboard Mac compatible?
Yes
Do the keys have the tactile click? My K95 with cherry red switches don't have the click and I hate it. I need the click for my typing style.
No they do not. If you have any cheap keyboard sitting around (rubber dome), the key press feels the same.
Does anyone suffer LED backlighting outage issues, like owners of the K70 do? It's an issue with the K70, so is it an issue with the K50?
Up until now I have had no problems with setting up or transitioning with the less. They stay as bright as you set them constantly.
do the different color WASD keys, and directional keys have different textures than the other keys?
No, the texture is the same on all the keys.
my son wants a gaming keyboard for avid minecraft use. Is this over the top, or useful, and awesome for this sort of 'gamer' thanks!
This is one of the more customizablly comfortable keyboards that I've used. There isn't really any noticeable insufficienties with it, but it is a little high for just to play minecraft. I recommend a steelseries Gv mechanical keyboard at the most if you're adamant on a mechanical keyboard.
Does this keyboard require you to plug it into two USB ports, or just one?
The K50 Has two I believe. I would recommend to look at unboxings
I am hoping to map additional language keys to the G-keys, is this possible? (i.e. I need some additional keys to type in German, like &auml;, etc.)
I would think so. I use mine for mapping keystrokes as a sizzle button and works great. As long as you can input the characters its should work fine. :D
Is the palm rest removeable?
Yeah it is, but I found it to be quite a bit more comfortable with it on.
How high is the back of the keyboard raised with legs fully extended? Measure please? {:^)-{{{----[
About an inch.
Are the lyrics appropriate for kids?
I'm shocked people answered yes. Check out the lyrics to "blurred lines" and "c'mon" just to name 2. They are both very sexual...I wouldn't consider that appropriate for kids.
What the system game, PAL or NTSC?
Regular wii gaming system, I am unfamiliar with what PAL or NTSC terms.
Will this work on a Wii from Europe PAL ?
The United States version of just dance wii game will not work on Wii console purchased in Europe. Also wii console purchased in the US can work in Europe only with a converter because of the voltage. Most plasma TV especially the ones with wifi sold in the recent time can play pal or NTSC without any problem. So I bought my wii console and all the games in the US, works perfectly in Europe with a converter and the tv bought in Europe.
Is this game and dance moves age appropriate for a 6 year old girl?
No
Just Dance Nintendo is Ok to use with regulat TV?
Yes as long as all of the wires fit into that specific t.v it's fine. Enjoy!
is this good for a five year old
Yes, My 3 yr old daughter loves it! If they love music and love to dance they will enjoy this. It also has music for their age which is a plus.
will this play on a Wii mini?
I wish I knew, but I'm not sure. I bought it for the original Nintendo Wii, so I have a feeling it is not compatible.
Is the Cupid Shuffle in the song list. I have been searching for a Just Dance that contains this song.
No it's not.
are all the songs kid appropriate?
Hi Mandy, Unfortunately, I don't recall any curse words but they are the actual songs word for word. If you don't feel comfortable with purchasing this specific one, purchase "Just Dance for Kids 2014". I'm sure its just as good.
Does this game support Motion Plus?
Yes

Best Buy says the depth of the New 3DS XL is 5.12 inches. This says the depth is 120 mm (4.72 inches). Has anyone tried it to confirm it fits?
I've taken my pouch to gamestop to when they had n3ds xl to demo. It fit perfectly fine, even with a bit of wiggle room. I was able to put the n3dsxl into a felt pouch and still fit it in the case. You should have no issues.
I have a question will this fit a 3ds xl and a AC adapter in it?
Yes, there is plenty of room for both the 3DS XL and the AC adapter! There's also two slots for games too.
is this a belt pouch?
No it can be attached to a belt using a carabineer but on its own only has a small metal hoop attaches to the back of the pouch
How many games can you fit in this with the 3DS XL?
The case has two sleeves inside that will hold two games. From how I have used it, I put the 3ds in the big pouch and there is plenty of room in the middle of the case for other items, such as cleaning cloths, the charger, or another small case for more games. It's up to you. I hope this helps : )
How would this fit a normal 3DS? The original, non-XL one. Will it rattle around inside this case?
There is a small elastic pouch inside the case where the DS sits. It should be held snug enough in the pouch so it might slide up and down inside but be protected by the cloth inside.
Would this case fit a New Nintendo 3ds, this would be great for my new MH4 3ds if it does!
I had the same question, so I poked around and looked for the actual dimensions of the case and of the New 3DS XL. If I'm reading the dimensions right, there's still plenty of room. The New 3DS is slightly bigger than the regular one, but there still should be room.
Is this real leather?
It's pleather.
Which section of the case is best suited to carry the 3DS XL, the large middle pouch or the more snug fitting inner pouch?
I would say this case has 3 sections - the 'back' and the 'front'. The back one is the snug one and fits the 3DS XL perfectly without a strap on it. The front section is exposed a bit more and currently holds my MH4 Card case perfectly. It can also hold the charger, headphones and other items of you choose to have a smaller card care (or don't take one at all). Hope this helps.
Will the New Nintendo 3DS XL fit inside this?
Yes
Does this fit New 3ds xl?
As far as I know it does.
Do I need Kinect to use this game?
Yes you do. You can control the menu and things with the controller but the actual gameplay is all about your own movements.
is it like dance central
The kids say its better!
Is this disc compatible on X-box 360 PAL (european) ?
Hi Asam Unfortunately, I bought NTSC and it did not work. But I have bought before PAL and it worked fine .. So make sure it reads PAL on the cover compatible.
Can I play this on an xbox 360 with 4GB of storage?
well... yes. I suppose you have kinect; because you must have to play
Does the DLC from JD4 work with JD2014?
No I that will not work but they have been putting up some DLC from that on Just Dance2014. So yes and no I guess. I'm sure they'll put more from the past JD4 on this one as time goes on.
will this disc work on a PAL console?
Not work!
Good morning, What kinda do you have to sell? I wanna it but I d like to know if you have others game. Thanks
We have 100's of different games on amazon.
How do you get the Karaoke to work?

Is there a port mic jack wher I can plug my mp3 up to it and play music while I game..Thanks??
yes there is a port mic jack on it so you can listen to music while you game. There is also Bluetooth if you wanted to use that to listen to music through your phone.
I have had this headset for almost a year now, but all of a sudden i cannot talk through my mic, is something broken??
Check your headset controls. Update console AND the headset by going to Turtle Beach website.
Does this come with ALL original cables and accessories?
yes comes with alll the leads ect all id advise is to buy a better optical cable as the 1 it comes with is really flimsy :)
can this unit be substituted for comuter headset
Yes with a blue tooth adapter
IT WORK FOR PC
Yes, it does
IT WORK DOR PC
Yes it does if your PC's sound card has a digital output (toslink/optical) a line out analog output (RCA).
This or the Tangos?
They are actually pretty similar. The Phantom is newer and should have slightly better specifications, like the processor is much faster, but you are unlikely to notice too much difference. It may come down to which color scheme you prefer. They are both compatible with an Xbox One if you get an adapter, and with the PS4, but you need to purchase a talkback cable for the Tango while that cable comes with the Phantom. That is $17 you don't need to spend if you get the Phantom.
Does it come with OEM Box?
Mine did, factory sealed
will this work with xbox one
Diane, you would also need to purchase an Xbox One Headset Adapter made by Microsoft to use this with an Xbox One. With the adapter it willwork perfectly with the Xbox One.
What cables do I need if I want them to work on ps4
Not sure about PS4, everything needed was included for my XBox 360.
Is this headset also compatible with the Xbox 360?
No. The Xbox one sends audio via wireless to the controller, then to the headset. Xbox 360 does not provide audio to the controller except voice chat.
Does this headset require batteries or charging? It's not wireless, right? So if it's wired I don't need to worry? Ugh, sorry :(
It is wired into the controller. It does not require battery's and will run off the controllers rechargeable battery's
Can you hear yourself chat through the headset?
unfortunately no you can not hear your self through the headset
Is there a way to listen through game audio through headset and tv at the same time?? Alsois there anoption toonly listen tochat ordoes ithave2beboth?
Yes, you can listen to game and TV at same time, when the tv is "snapped", and you can also listed to your xbox live party at the same time. One word of caution: the controller currently converts game audio to stereo (NOT surround sound). There may be a patch to fix this in the future, but who knows. There are 2 icons on the left of the adapter...the top is the controller icon that controls the game volume, the bottom is a person icon that controls the chat party volume. If you hold the chat icon for a couple seconds, it will mute the game volume; if you just tap one or the other, you can volume up or down the selected line.
Does this headset have mic monitoring?
You need to get the new version, the XO SEVEN Pro, to get mic monitoring. We just added it to the newer models of the XO ONE, XO SEVEN Pro, and XO FOUR Stealth.
i can use it for listening for music in iphone 5 ?
You can with the second cable provided. You can also use that cable on a computer too. It is just like any normal headphone jack.
I recently got the XO Four Turtle Beach and the only major issue I have is how it's very uncomfortable on my head. Is this one better?
Yeah, very comftarble and excellent quality, I as a gamer I highly recommend them.
Is the xbox one stereo headset adapter included?
Yes it is
How Do I go about being able to hear the game play and the chat at the same time? it seems like I'm only hearing one or the other?
Make sure your controller is updated ...
Will the headset work? Im using a monitor (HDMI-DVI) instead of a TV and I'm getting sound from pc speakers through S/PDIF rather than from a TV.
It should. The headset doesn't plug into the console/TV at all. It's a regular stereo headset, and it comes with an adapter for the Xbox One controller. The only cables plug into the controller, and there's a spare more suited to another device like a phone or laptop.
can this be used wirelessly to watch movies from my xbox 360? thanks
Unfortunately no. Need to run the cord at all times. But this is a great headset has alot of uses
Will this work for xbox one chat
Yes. You just have to buy this...
will these work with a pc
Yup. I use them frequently with my PC. Just plug the USB and microphone jack in and you are good to go.
What size is the Plug? I'm looking to use this with a cordless phone handset.
The headset has a 3.5mm "4-pole" plug hardwired to it. It is not designed for use with cordless landline handsets, but will connect to most smartphones and tablets.
HI.Any one know where i can purchase a mike boom for a turtle beach spectre headset
eBay or Amazon. This headset is not all that anyway. Not surround sound and the speakers are only so so. I would invest in a true surround sound headset to hear footstep and vehicle direction better.
as soon as you get it, is it ready to go and use on the xbox 360?
Yes....you can use it with your phone ...or with xbox 360 or xbox one...
are they wireless
No..
is this compatible with the new xbox 1
Neil, you would also need an Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter made by Microsoft to use this with an Xbox One. With that adapter it is fully compatible.
Will they work on an xbox one?
Yes
if i use this for my xbox one. Will the adapter replace the amplifier that comes with the headset?
I am use with XBOX 360 and noew we are connected to TV.

how would i set it up for hdmi?
The same way you set up any turtle beaches, just put the red & white component cables from your console into the turtle beach ports & you'll be fine, the HDMI is from your console to your TV, that has nothing to do with the beaches. :D
Where can I get an extra audio cable that comes with this headset (the one with the green end)
amazon
Does this Call of Duty Turtle Beach Headset work with the PS4 out of the box with nothing extra?
Yes it's ps4 compatible
I have a Mac Air, and wondering what the connector/cable options are... is it USB, classic speaker/mic?
Play On Anything Go from a console player on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 to a PC or Mac gamer to playing on your phone, tablet or mobile gaming device and back again with a quick switch of wires. 3.5mm, 4-pole auxillary cable, RCA splitter cable
do you have to get the xbox 360 adaptor or whatever
If you mean the voice cable for the 360 then yes other than that I do not know
will it work for a iMac computer out of the box?
Yes it will.
Can I listen to in-game sound and my mp3 player simultaneously? Like, if I turn off the in game music and leave on in game sfx and then play my mp3?
Yes indeed. The inline amp has an input where you can connect any source using a 3.5mm jack. So you can plug in your phone, tablet, or anything else you just need the right cable. Fortunately it also comes with a 3.5mm mobile adapter cord and a 3.5mm to RCA plug adapter cord.
Is the wire just covered in the rubber coating or is it the higher end cloth/braid wrap?
The Shadow uses a thick rubber coated cable. The next version up in this line, the Spectre, uses the braided cloth.
how many cords do you have to hook up to actually listen , and how long are the cords
That depends upon what you are connecting it to. The user guide has diagrams for each possible configuration (http://cdn-assets.turtlebeach.com/products/396/shadow_usermanual_en_101713.pdf). I believe the cord on the inline amp is 16 ft. long, as it runs to the back of the console, and the others are all shorter.
can i connect to my iphone 5c
Yes

Yes
Does this headset come with the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter?
Yes, it comes with the adapter.
Can you hear your voice in the headphones during chat, so you do not begin to shout?
If you are referring to the voice monitoring system where the headset plays your voice back through the speakers like on the x12, then no. This was a big disappointment, as I loved that feature on my x12's (my wife loved it more:) You can hear yourself if you talk loud enough, but that defeats the purpose. This was one huge letdown for me with this headset, as the playback feature on the x12's was perhaps the best feature of the headset.
Is this headset wireless?
No, it plugs into an adapter that plugs into the Xbox controller
What's the difference between this model &amp; the Ear Force XO Four Stealth?
The XO FOUR Stealth has a new chat adapter made by Turtle Beach that repalces the one made by Microsoft that ships with the XO FOUR. It adds more features. like mic monitoring, Bass Boost, and others ... you can read about it here ... http://www.turtlebeach.com/product-detail/pc-accessories/ear-force-headset-audio-controller/644
How exactly does the headset connect to the console? What kind of connection is it?
The headset connects to the included Xbox One audio adapter, which is then plugged Into the bottom of the controller. The headset itself uses a common 'headphone' plug.
Is the mic detachable?
Yes but leave it in a safe place so you dont lose it
Does it play game sound through the headset?
Yes but it plays volume through TV also, have not figured out a way to mute TV sound and keep sound only in headset. It's a great headset though!
How good is the headset adapter? Is it the official xbox headset adapter or Turtle Beach's version?
The XO FOUR comes with the original Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter made by Microsoft. If you want one of the Turtle Beach adapters, which add features like mic monitoring and Bass Boost and other presets you should look at the XO ONE, XO SEVEN Pro, or the Call of Duty Sentinel Task Force or Call of Duty Sentinel Prestige. Those headsets were all launched after Microsoft decided that headset manufacturers needed to make their own adapters. Up until the summer of 2014 Microsoft mandated that manufacturers use the adapter made by Microsoft.
This product brings Stereo Headset Adapter?
Yes, It has the adapter for the controller.
can i use with iphone
Yes
playstation 3
Yes it can be used with the PS3. The chat function (voice only) works through the USB but if you want in game audio you'll need either a jack input or the component cable from your PS3. I just used a jack input so that I wouldn't have to lose my HDMI. It is the same method for the PS4 and PC if you are interested in those as well. In my opinion this headset is the best choice at its price.
Could I hear in game sound?
I am not certain on all games, but a few I have played yes and some no. Thanks
Will these work with the ps4? If so, how do I set it up?
Technically, yes, and it is very simple to set up. You must plug the USB into the PS4 and the headphone jack into the controller, then go to settings and change all sounds to go to the headset. The issue with this is that you must sit directly in front of your tv because the split in the cord is so short. I mostly use them with my laptop. I have been meaning to test if it is necessary to plug the jack into the controller. If it does work without that, then these work great with the PS4!
Does this work on the Wii U?
Yes, if you use it without the inline amp it will work fine
Is there an option that let's you change your voice?
Not that I know of, no.
Anyone knows if it works on a wii u?
Yes it will work on a Wii U. Just unplug the headset from the inline amp and plug it directly into the Wii U's 3.5mm audio port. Easy Peasy. The Marvel Seven is a great headset, I actually use one at my desk every day for phone calls and video chat.
What adaptor do I need to purchase to be able to use these on an xBox one?
At the moment, I believe the only adapter on the market is sold by Microsoft. http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00OIPOTYG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416942895&sr=8-2&keywords=xbox+one+chat+adapter&pebp=1416942902749 The Marvel Headset is really nice, I use it every day at the office.
Is the audio cable connected to the ear cup removable? I would like to be able to use the headset with a different audio cable.
No it's not removable.
PX22 or this?
definitely this
How comfortable is this headset? What about the sound quality?
Comfort is good you just have to break them in first. They were tight on me out of the box but after a few nights of leaving them extended on a box that wasn't an issue. But comfort is really dependent on your opinion and preference. Sound is very good in my opinion these are better than the more pricey headsets out right now. The mixer is a bit of a pain to use though depending on what platform you'll be using these on. I got these for the PC and have to change some settings to get them to work properly. Lately I have been using them on the PS4 except the mixer will not work at all for me. Just the headset itself plugged into the controller works fine though.
playstation 3
Yes it can be used with the PS3. The chat function (voice only) works through the USB but if you want in game audio you'll need either a jack input or the component cable from your PS3. I just used a jack input so that I wouldn't have to lose my HDMI. It is the same method for the PS4 and PC if you are interested in those as well. In my opinion this headset is the best choice at its price.
Could I hear in game sound?
I am not certain on all games, but a few I have played yes and some no. Thanks
Will these work with the ps4? If so, how do I set it up?
Technically, yes, and it is very simple to set up. You must plug the USB into the PS4 and the headphone jack into the controller, then go to settings and change all sounds to go to the headset. The issue with this is that you must sit directly in front of your tv because the split in the cord is so short. I mostly use them with my laptop. I have been meaning to test if it is necessary to plug the jack into the controller. If it does work without that, then these work great with the PS4!
Does this work on the Wii U?
Yes, if you use it without the inline amp it will work fine
Is there an option that let's you change your voice?
Not that I know of, no.
Anyone knows if it works on a wii u?
Yes it will work on a Wii U. Just unplug the headset from the inline amp and plug it directly into the Wii U's 3.5mm audio port. Easy Peasy. The Marvel Seven is a great headset, I actually use one at my desk every day for phone calls and video chat.
What adaptor do I need to purchase to be able to use these on an xBox one?
At the moment, I believe the only adapter on the market is sold by Microsoft. http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00OIPOTYG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1416942895&sr=8-2&keywords=xbox+one+chat+adapter&pebp=1416942902749 The Marvel Headset is really nice, I use it every day at the office.
Is the audio cable connected to the ear cup removable? I would like to be able to use the headset with a different audio cable.
No it's not removable.
PX22 or this?
definitely this

Can this xbox connect to the internet via a wired connection?
yes
So, DOES it have hdmi output? (The Xbod itself is not a monitor so I can't "watch movies right on it." I still have to connect to a screen)
Yes, it has HDMI output.
will the 320GB hard drives for the XBOX 360 slim fit in this model? are they the same?
Yes, we replaced the 4 gb with a 320 gb in 3 systems for my boys..all three work great
if all I want is to play games, is 4GB good enough, I dont need or want all the bells and whistles, just gameplay
As long as you're going to play games of the actual discs, then yes 4 gigabytes is plenty good. If you are wanting to download games from xbox live and run them off a hard drive, then 4 gigs will not get you very far.
This console is compatible with kinectic?
Yes
can i add a hard drive
You don't need a proprietary Microsoft one. I ordered this Hausbell one, which was the cheapest available at Amazon, at the time: http://www.amazon.com/Hausbell-320G-Hard-Drive-Microsoft/dp/B00B0QONB0/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1417195335&sr=8-16&keywords=xbox+hard+drive -it installed very easily and automatically, and has worked perfectly. There are larger ones now available, and I'd guess other brands are just as good. In fact, my drive had nothing that identified it as a "Hausbell" drive -the drive looked totally generic. Note that this and other drives advertised and/or labeled as for the Slim, work fine on the 360E because the octagonal slots are identical.
do you have to pay for internet?
As of this past summer, you are no longer required to subscribe to Xbox Live to use apps such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and HBOGo. The only thing you need the subscription for now is multiplayer gaming.
Can i play dvds from it?
Yes you lost certainly can but not Blu Ray ones. Only Playstation 3 and 4 does that. And you can do Netflix and Hulu also.
how many controllers can be used with this systm? at the same time.
4
How do I know which memory upgrade to buy??? See some comments about some of the upgrades not fitting this unit???
I bought this one here at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Hausbell-320G-Hard-Drive-Microsoft/dp/B00B0QONB0/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&qid=1417195335&sr=8-16&keywords=xbox+hard+drive, but today I'd get this bigger one that is now available: http://www.amazon.com/500GB-Hard-Drive-Internal-Black/dp/B00JJIJNB6/ref=pd_cp_pc_3. Mine installed easily and automatically, and works fine. Any hexagonal drive designed for the Xbox will work, and any that are supposed to be for the Slim (like mine) will work perfectly on the 360E.
if i buy this used does it come with cords?
Depends on the seller. If it's used... But it should.
does this come with any cords
It comes with the basic cords. If you like games in HD you gotta buy your own
Should i buy the used xbox you have 250 gigs or should i buy another hardrive Why i ask is i bought a xbox 20 gig but it was refurbished and only 13 g
I return this xbox because of the Region, mine is Pal because im in Europe. If you want to install games on your console you should go for more gigs otherwise buy one that you thinks its best for you!
Would I be better off buying the 250g Elite (the older, black model) or this newer version? I use my Xbox solely for FPS/Netflix
This one for sure , better system for the $ the elite made noises and always messed up so get this
is there a headset included with the new xbox
If you buy it brand new yes or you could just buy the headset seperately.
is there a headset included
Unfortunately no.
Will tthe headphones work with the X box 360 E witch is without a digital output on the console ? Is there some kind of adaptor you can buy ?
This is worded kind of difficult for me to understand, but if you are talking about the simple headset that plugs into the controller, there is no need for an adapter. But if your wanting to use Turtle Beaches or other fancy ones, you'll need to buy the adapter from their company.
Does this "updated" model fix the constant red ring of death of the older model?
I haven't had the red ring since using this model. It has worked great for me. As to fixing things with this one, I am sure they have updated some things.
what is ntsc
Ntsc is a video standard used in the usa Othet countries like brazil use pal format for video Any device for video like any type of playback device or even movies like dvds or actual games need to be of the correct format for your country and the device they have to match each other Ntsc player = ntsc dvd or ntsc game this will make them compatible. Hope this helps
Can you add the purchased hard drive on the side like the arcade model? My son had the arcade model and the hard drive on the side?
This unit uses a hardrive configuration that goes in a slot. The hard drive is not on the side like the white xbox 360 models. The harddrive for this model is different than the sidemounted ones
I keep reading about a monthly fee... if I'm just looking to play games bought from the store, is there a monthly fee involved?
The fee is for the Microsoft service. You can play games without paying for the service. But, you will not get full functionality available on the the xbox (video streaming, etc.)
do I need an internet connection to use this?
No only for updates but not for playing watching movies listing to music you download from a music
Can this play my old Xbox games pre 360?
The older model of xbox 360 you can but this one I don't know never tried it
Is blu-ray drive present with the console? if yes, can I play blu ray movies using this?
Unfortunately there is no Blu-ray drive present with the console, so you will not be able to play Blu-ray movies with this particular console.
Is this console compatible with the preconfigured xbox 360 flash drives you plug into the usb port?
I would have to a yes maybe since it's also a xbox 360 but do I know for sure no so for now buy it and try it if it's work then it's a yes if not sorry
Can I put in my XBOX 360 slim hard drive?
Yes, you can use a generic hard drive (with case and correct xbox 360 format) or original hard drive, both are on sale in amazon.com
if you have an xbox and use it only for games on a disc... do you have to pay the monthly fee for the xbox LIVE?
No- that what I do. I don't pay anything
what is the electricity voltage. is it 110v or 220v. Thanks
110 but it goes into transformer. Don't know transformer output.
do I need internet to play games at home? or I can buy a cd game and play and home without any problem
You should be able to play games without internet, simply playing discs you've purchased. But you'd miss out on any updates your system may need.
Is it possible to ship this item to India ?
No. Sorry I don't do international shipping.
Does this have singleplayer?
No, it does not... it's the first that I've ever experienced a game like this - everything you do is online/multiplayer; however, there are the following features that give you the 'single player' experience. 1) Small Squads - the online players make up about 10 of the soldiers that are fighting on the field; there are dozens of 'grunts' and 'spectres' which are part of the program (much easier to kill like in traditional single player modes). They balance it out with the 'live players' so it's a good mix. 2) There is a traditional 'campaign' mode that you can play from start to finish, but again, it's always online and there's always 'live' players mixed in with the computer enemies. 3) The developer rolled out their new enhanced 'match making' algorithm which takes the learning curve frustrations out of the way, i.e. as you get better, they match you with better players and visa versa. There's a 'training' section but that's super basic stuff. The game is just awesome... your pilots are outfitted with special jump kits so, in addition to walking, running, sprinting, etc. you can jump and get these little jet powered boosts... and there's the ability to perform special wall running/jumping moves that changes the shooter landscape completely.. Hope that helps...
Is it possible to send it to Brazil?
It should be, I live in Germany and it made it here.
Is this and Dead Rising 3 worth an xbox one?
I honestly think so, but I use my Xbox for all the apps and watch my TV thru it as well. I also heard that titanfall 2 will be available for ps4
Does the game support two people with gold memberships playing on the same console, ie splitscreen?
Sorry, no splitscreen.
How big is the download update for this game if I buy the disc version (Xbox one)?
Doesn't hardly take any at all. I can't tell you exact amount but since there isn't any campaign it's drastically cut down
Does anyone play this game online anymore?
Barely any people play at all now
Do you need a "chat headset" and a "Kinect" in order to play Titanfall?
No, you definitely do not need either. You will need a headset if you want to talk to other players online. What you do need is a subscription to Xbox Live Gold because this game is 100% online.
do titanfall has a competitive/ranked gametype ?? like halo arenas, csgo competitive mode or CoD ranked games ? or is it just normal games like BF4 ?
No ranked matches are available at this time. However, there are updates made to the game all the time (they just recently added private matches) and I expect that to be a gamerype added at a future time.
It states rated for M -- my son is 10 and loves that his friends play this game online with classmates -- how concerned should I be about the content?
I'm 18, and I've been playing this game for a while now. In my opinion it does not have really graphic content or strong obscene language, just a fun sci-if game.
Does this game offer two-person co-op?
This game does not offer co-op of any kind. You can only play on Xbox Live together from different consoles.
Does the hi def make it worth buying
Yes
It says "a new save system". I loved the save for the original xbox where they had slots &amp; an autosave. Is this version like that or like Fable 2/3?
It has three save slots, autosave and you can save to the slots anytime you want.
do you have to be online to play this game?
No, you do not need to be online. As far as I can tell there's no online element. The only thing going online will do for you is update the game with any bug patches or fixes. It's not necessary to play.
Did they add an option to play as a female (like in Fable II and III)?
No, it's just a remake of Fable 1.
Is Fable Anniversary like the original Fable or is it more like Fable: The Lost Chapters?
It's a direct port of The Lost Chapters version of the game, only with updated visuals and sound + tweaked controls.
Did they add the ability to have children in this revamp?
Yes
A question - is gameplay for Fable Anniversary similar to games like Oblivion, with first-person perspective and all?
you don't get to look through eyes just from behind
I believe I had read a little while ago that the original Fable game used hands-free gameplay. This game being a remake of that first Fable, is it also a hand's Free game, or would the player be using a controller?
The original Fable was not hands free, so this game is not either. That would be cool though!
is this just the fist game converted to 360 or a completly new game that takes place after fable 3
It's a remastered version of the first game. New graphics, old game.
does this game have multiplayer mode?
Nope
How long is the cable?
According to the official Xbox website, this product contains the following: "Contents: Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery Pack and Charging Cable (9 foot USB to Micro-USB)." Hope this helps.
Anyone know how many mAh this battery is? The Energizer battery is 1200 but I do not see it anywhere on the product description for this one.
1400MAH
Can it charge when Xbox One is turned off?
Other posters are completely incorrect. It does charge with Xbox off (assuming Xbox is plugged in), just as it advertises.
Can the cable connect to -and the battery be charged by- a usb wall charging unit instead of connecting it to the box?
Scott is wrong you can charge this with a wall charger as long as the wall charger puts out enough amps, i.e. my iPad charger allows me to charge it but the smaller iPhone does not. hope this helps. I know you posted this a while ago and you probably already know the answer.
does it work for pc ?
It does not, sorry! But you plug it right into your Xbox and can play while charging
Can you use the cable to connect to a windows PC?
Microsoft promised controller support for Windows 8 in late 2014. So keep trying and it will eventually work. http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controller-pc-compatibility If you can't get it to work try the drivers from the link.
how long is the cord
Roughly 8 feet. If that's not long enough try monoprice, but it wont have the fancy charging/charged light.
The description claims 30 hours of battery life, but how much did you get out of it before having to charge it?
Definitely around that amount. I usually charge around once a week and it charges in about 1 to 2 hours.
Is this product essentially the same as putting 2 aa rechargeable batteries into the controller and just plugging a micro usb until charged?
No. I'm not sure what kind of rechargeable batteries you have, but I have tried this before with the energizer rechargeable batteries and it doesn't work because you can only charge them with the charger case thing that comes with the batteries. I'm guessing this can be applied to all rechargeable batteries. For some reason the usb charger won't recognize the batteries, and if they do charge it is a lie! Maybe this didn't work for just me, byt it's better if you just buy the battery pack. Much longer battery life.
Is there any type of warranty? I bought one barely 5 months ago and the cord isn't charging the controller anymore.
No warranty. But check to make sure it isn't the weather or anything bothering the current of electricity
its slim or super slim
Super slim

Its a disk& no you don't need internet to play the game . you need the internet for Netflix or to go online and things like that
will this ship to delhi,india on cash on delivery????????????
Probably not. Refer to Amazon's customer service department for more detailed information on shipping and payment method.

Hello friend, I would like to know that quality is the PS3 has a defect ?
No defect that I know of. Since buying this system it has been a champ!
If bundle is purchased do you have to purchase seperate items to work. I did when i got a xbox 360
I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but the system comes with everything, and the gta v disc is the full game.
this console has bluray?
Yes. The PS3 plays PS3 Blu-Ray games, DVDs, PS1 Games, Blu-Ray movies, and CDs.
Do you shipping to Israel ? ?
Yeah it may take a while but that should be ok. You'd have to buy the expedited shipping option.
Can you play the single player offline or do you have to be online to play? Thanks for any info! Have a great day!
5 V. 5, yes. MyGM, no. MyCareer, yes but it takes longer to level up your player without VC.
what difficulty mode is best to play on?
I'm playing on All-Star difficulty with 6 or 7 mins per quarter. I highly advise to try tuning the User and CPU sliders for best experience in singleplayer mode, mainly toning down CPU's superhuman abilities like high % of made FGs, and offensive rbs etc etc. If you want, you can check out this great website www.operationsports.com for more info about NBA 2K sliders settings in the site's forum section.
Can 1 player play this game?
Yes, you can
i can play in spanish?
Yes, you need to change your language system to spanish
is there the slam dunk contest and 3 point shooting contest in this game?
The dunk contest and three point shootout are in the myCareer and myGM modes. In myCareer you can only do the shootout because of some weird glitch. Not sure about myGM.
According to what iam reading you can't create a new team and create players and put them on it,is that correct?can someone answer this queation for me.
I'm not sure I've only gotten nba 2k games because of my player mode
Can I create players and teams outside of MyPlayer and MyTeam mode?
no but you can on 2k15
Can I play this game with my cousin on the same screen on the same system? 2 players?
Yes you can. I think 4 players, if not more, can play on the same system.

yes it can be if you choose. very fun game for kids, men and even family time for father and son. hope you enjoy it
If i use the Wii-motes to play, do I NEED the nunchuck thing, if so then would it be better to just get the pro controller?
Nope, you just play with the Wii Remote sideways like an NES controller. Of course if you want, you could get the Pro Controller too.
does it work on wii
No. Is only for Wii U
Do you need a 3d tv
Nope, just an HD TV, the higher quality the better but you don't need it
We just ordered the Wii U... what extra controllers will we need for multiplayer use?
You can literally use any controller: the old Wii controllers work as well as the standard one that comes with the Wii U. I prefer the Wii U wireless controllers they made for the system
is it worth 50 bucks?
This is certainly worth $50. You can buy it used for cheaper, too. This is just my opinion, though.
Does this game have the limited/simple player 2 option like on Mario Galaxy that makes it easier for younger kids to play along?
I never played Mario Galaxy. Mario 3D World has a multiplayer where the players who fall behind will automatically be put in a bubble to catch up with the player or players in the lead. I play with my nieces (3-5 yrs) all the time. They don't even notice the bubble bringing them along. Great family game.
is this game any fun for single players?
This game is plenty of fun single player, the way mario games are made is that there seems to be a natural flow of running and jumping that is inherent in your very nature. This makes it seem natural to jump around as you get better and more used to the game. It is definitely a worthy purchase for any Wii U owner.
Do you have to use the gamepad if you are playing single player?
Some areas of the game require the gamepad. When you encounter those areas, the game will tell you how to switch controllers.
Can I use the wheel accessory in this game?
No. One person can use the GamePad, and up to three others can use a wiimote, classic controller, pro controller, or wii+nunchuck.
Can you play the campaign with two players? Or is it just one..?
You can play the campaign with up to four players

is yoshis new island suitable for 6 year old
Most definitely !!!
How bad is the music?
Like others have said, it's subjective. The music that people use to deter others from playing only appear in the early stages of the game and only once, yet they continue to ignorantly dismiss the rest of the soundtrack and thus the entire game itself in some sort of backwards thinking. The music is remixed like the usual fashion of Mario World and the original Yoshi's Island, it's very cheery, calming, or exciting depending on the level. The only way to know for sure how the music is, is to play the games itself because the music is all made to accompany the levels and they flow quite nicely together.
can this be played on regular DS?
I'm sorry, Becky - no. Yoshi's New Island is only for 3DS and 2DS.
Is this game compatible with the 2DS as well?
Yes
Is this for handheld Nintendo?
Yes, it is for a Nintendo 3DS handheld game.
How many save files are on this game?
This game has three save files. :)
Is this a good game for a 5-7 year old
My 5 year old plays it and hardly ever gets stuck. So I would say it is good
What is the game about?
Yoshi has to rescue a kidnapped baby luigi while protecting baby Mario so the brothers can be reunited.

Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Yes it does, my son and I enjoy playing together.
Does this game support the use of the wii u pro controller instead of the gamepad?
Yes it does! That's what I use to play this game! :)
Is this a Gamepad only game or can a Wiimote be used with it?
All controller options are supported
does this work on the Wii????
This game is for the Wii U, so it won't work on an older system. You can play Wii games on the Wii U however.
wich region it is ?
It works on Wii U's sold in the Americas only.
Is this a very hard game compared to Donkey Kong Country Returns? Or is it hard in general? I don't want to buy something that will be too difficult.
Both games are a bit challenging. I haven't completed Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze to assess the whole game, but I don't think Returns is any harder. If you thought the previous one was too difficult, you might not like this one either. I would recommend Super Mario 3D World as it is easier but a lot of fun.
How do you play the game? What's the objective/moves, etc?
The game is a 2D platformer in which you, as Donkey Kong, romp through lush worlds, reaching the end of each level, and facing difficult boss battles. Donkey Kong can run, jump, roll, climb, and pound the ground. He can also have an ally like Diddy, Dixie, or Cranky Kong to use powers such as hovering, a double jump, and bouncing.
Does this game have the online nintendo club code unused inside?
If you buy it new it comes with a new club Nintendo code. If you buy it used there is a chance it will be missing.
Is this game easier or harder than the wii's Donkey Kong?
Much, much harder. The game even borders on cruel at times. However, it is some of the most clever and ingenious platformer game design I've ever played. Plus, I'm a sucker for the music and style of the original games and this one manages to more closely capture the imagination of those games.
Would you recommend for a 9yr, 7yr, &amp; 4yr who love Skylanders, Infinity, &amp; Smash Bros? Someone said it would be too frustrating?!
I have a 4 & 8 years old who love the same games and they love this game!! We play together and we teach them to never give up!!!!

does the wii remote have the wii jacket
Yes it does. It came with it.
Can one player use the Wii U gamepad or do all players have to use a Wii Remote Plus controller?
It varies by mini game. There are some that pit game pad player vs the others with remotes who use the television to play. There are others that don't use the game pad at all, if I recall correctly, and some that use the game pad flat on its back like an old school two player Pac-Man game. The game comes with a small collapsible stand that will hold the pad flat. Lots of variety to the way the mini games use the Wii U.
Is this game good for small children... say age 5?
Yes
Can this game be used with the original wii if you don't care or want the u game pad
No, you must have a Wii U to play this game.
Will the wii u pro controller work with this game?
I dont know
Is this just the game or does this come with the stand, and a remote?
It came with a remote. No stand.
Is it interactive, meaning can I play with others around the world?
No, it is only play with your friends.
I've read in the comments that this is best for 3-4 players. Can only one person play?
I think you have to have at least two players. I know they will have NPCs to fill in for the rest.....the game is most certainly meant for kids...I play it with my kid sometimes just as a bonding thing....my kid just checked and she says you must have 2 players
What controllers are supported?
Each player needs one Wii Remote, with or without Motion Plus makes no difference. You will also need the Wii U Gamepad for many of the games, often passing it around. All other controllers like Pro or Classic Controllers are, as far as I know, not supported at all.
does this game have bowling?
No, this is no Wii Sports wich you can buy online at the eShop

Do I need the wii nunchuck to play this game?
Yes
will this game work with a normal wii, or only wii u?
It only works on Wii U. You can use Wii games on Wii U console, but you cannot use Wii U games on a Wii console. I hope this helps!
Does this game require the Wii Plus remote or can it be played without it?
Yes, for many of the events it will be required.
Is the Wii U game different than the original Wii one?
It's quite different. Some events are the same as they are olympic events but there are far more different events than there are same ones.
for how many players?
4
if i add a motion sensor to the back of my normal wii remote, does that work with this? or do i need a new remote all together?
no you will have to get the wii U remote with sensor
What are also supported controllers?
It uses both the wii u controller and the basic woo controller. You do not need the one sold with the game.
Is this game 2 player?
Yes, it can be played with more than 2 people also in some games.
What winter games does it have? Also again can I play wii games on my wii u console
You can play wii games on the wii u. You will have to save the data from the wii on a sd card and tranfer it to the wii u. Wii u has instruction on how to do it
Does the Wii Balance Board work with this game?
My son - who owns/uses the game - says no, the board will not work because it does not have the Motion Plus built into it.

Can you use the Wii U gamepad? Or do you have to use a wheel?
You can use gamepad, pro controller, wii remote (with or without wheel), or classic controller (and pro).
when will this game be shipped?
Usually you get pre-order games the day they are released. Except for Nintendo games, I'm on Amazon Prime and every Nintendo game in the last 2 years or so that I have pre-ordered have been shipped out the day or day after their release date (some were released on Sunday so they were shipped out on Monday).
Will I be able to play this game on my regular Wii? Or do I have to have the Wii U console?
As others stated, Wii-U games are only playable on a Wii-U console. The Wii-U however is completely backwards compatible with all Wii titles, Wii Virtual Console titles, and Wii-Motes/Nunchucks, except a few dance games/accessories that may require the GameCube controller ports. The Wii-U is not backwards compatible with GameCube games or accessories.
I assume that we're going to get the Club Nintendo download code for one free copy of either SMB U, Pikmin, Zelda Wind Waker or Wii Party U, correct?
Yes, you must register Mario Kart 8 between 5/30/14 (12:00a.m. ET) and 7/31/14 (11:59 p.m. PT) on Club Nintendo and you'll receive a free download code for the digital version of one of four free games.
Anyone know if it will be compatible with the pro controller?
Yes, it will be compatible.
Is the Mario Kart 8 Wii U bundle not being sold by Amazon?
Amazon doesn't directly sell any Wii U consoles. It's all third party sellers. The bundle may show up at some point, but it won't be direct from Amazon in all likelihood.
Does this game will come with a game code for one of four other games (New Super Mario Bros. U, The Wind Waker HD, Pikmin 3)? I read that elsewhere
Yes. You register your copy of Mario Kart 8 with Club Nintendo before July 31 to get the download. The registration code is inside the game case.
What countries can this item be shipped?
Unless you own an American Wii U it won't matter where Amazon.com ship. The console is region locked, so if you live in places like Europe, Australia or any PAL region, you won't be able to play this edition and will have to buy from a store stocking PAL games.
Does the game come with a wheel like the Wii version?
No. Only the Mario Kart 8 Wii U Bundle comes with a red Mario themed wheel. You can however buy a Mario or Luigi themed wheel separately. You can also buy the original white or black ones.
Do you need the wii motion plus or the regular wiimote work with this game?
Regular Wii remote will work fine.
Can you use the Wii U gamepad? Or do you have to use a wheel?
You can use gamepad, pro controller, wii remote (with or without wheel), or classic controller (and pro).

I love campaign modes on other first-person shooters and play offline quite a bit. This a problem with this game? Description troubles me.
Definitely. You cannot play offline and the campaigns are just multiplayer games with a set map progression. Therefore if you are looking for a 'single player experience' this game does not have it.
My son is about to be 11 and is dying for this game. I've never bought him an M rated game. How is the violence and language in this game?
You shoot pixel soldiers and robots with pixel guns until they fall over or blow up. When you sneak behind an enemy you can snap his or her neck. It's a shooter so of course there will be blood and violence, but it's nothing that'll traumatize him. As for language, he probably hears worse things during recess at school.
What's the price of the season pass on the 360 version?
It's $24.99. source: http://www.titanfall.com/news/season-pass-and-digital-deluxe
This game has to be used with a XBOX hard drive. I got some advice that it needs an 'internal' hard drive that costs $100+. What is the correct product to use?
You need one of the internal Xbox 360 hard drives. Get the official Xbox branded drives from Microsoft themselves. The 3rd party HDDS are lower quality and can get your console banned. USB devices will NOT work, not even external USB hard drives.
Is this the PAL version of the game? I am asking because in the picture the region says PAL.
The version I received after ordering states NTSC in the location you see PAL on the cover. I cannot speak for Amazon however I'm pretty sure based on your location and the type of order that you will receive the correct version based on the address of your primary account information. If there is a problem with your order once received, I would leave the plastic wrapping on, contact amazon customer service, and exchange it for the correct format.
My dad and I plan on playing this together, and it says 'XBLive Gold Required'. Do we need one or two for both of us?
There is no split screen option, so you can only play one at a time. The profile for your play is linked to your xbox live profile, so as long as you and your father are ok with sharing an xbox live gold account, and stats, you only need one gold account. Please be aware that this game can only be played online with xbox live. There is no offline play available.
Why is Titanfall rated M? Also for whatever makes it rated M can I turn it off? Can I turn off blood, language etc?
Its rated M for blood death and shooting. No sex. No you cant turn it off its part of the whole game.
Can you turn off the blood? Also can you turn off the voices?
I don't think you can turn off the blood. But yes, you can turn off the voices.
The rating says it has "strong language" is there anyway to turn that off?
No, not that I am aware of
Is there an online game code that comes with the game? I ask because there are some great used game deals for TitanFall. Thanks.
No, there isn't a game code. A used copy should be fine.
Is there a single player to Titanfall or is it just a multiplayer only?
It's multiplayer online only. Completely lacking single player campaign or mode. You cannot even created a private match alone against grunts and spectres and even if you could you still need to be connected 24/7 to actually play any of the game including the tutorial. It needs Internet to be playable.
Will Titanfall run on a macbook pro?
lol
Will the game work on a PC with Windows 8?
Should not have any problems. I run it on 8.1
Do you have to pay for online multiplayer or is it free?
just purchase the game then your set, you don't pay for multiplayer
My son really wants this game but M rating isn't going to fly with Mom. Is there a way to turn off blood / gore for PC version?
Unfortunately to my knowledge there is no option to turn off blood and gore, however the worst thing that will be witnessed is a 2 second scene that occurs when a Titan crushes a pilot. All you see during this move is a misty red cloud. Aside from that the game is actually pretty clean.
Wondering how you play this game on a desktop PC? Do you use a wireless controller or a keyboard and mouse? Which controller setup is best?
The best setup is with a keyboard and mouse. Mice give much greater accuracy when compared to controllers. Although you can play with a controller you might be at a disadvantage though.
Does this work on Win 8?
Yep, I use 8.1 And I there's no problems
Do you have to pay an additional membership for playing the game or is it enough with buying the game?
Honestly, I am not sure. But some period they gave us special offer for free seasonal passes and maps. I think you don't have to pay an additional membership for playing.
With Titanfall for PC ... are you playing against XBOX One, etc, players? Also, can you pull your game data from XBOX Live account (I take it not)?
don't know about second, but it is totally online against others, and there seems no differentiation of platform, and there is a lot of hacking. great graphics and controls, but very short till it isn't enjoyable. At ant rate, there are plenty of opponents.
Is this for Digital Download?
nope. Hard copy
Is there a monthly fee on this game?
Yes, there is a monthly fee but the game includes one free month
Monthly Fee???!!! u mean besides the PlayStation Plus Subscription and the Game Disk's actual price (37.58$) there is still a monthly fee?
you don't need ps plus to play online you just have to pay the monthly subscription.
I've never played FF before it looks really good Is this the type of game i can just buy the newest 1 n jump right in or do i need to start with 1?
You can just hop in and play it. It has a different storyline and is not connected to the others. The only thing that is connected is some of the Class Jobs you start with and the Advanced Jobs you can unlock etc. It is a very fun game I have been playing since the Re-launch. Every class is fun to play just play what you enjoy best! Little tip if you have not done any of the content just say in chat that this is your first time etc and people will help you out.
I now own a PS4 after owning a PS3 for years. Can I use my FF XIV PS3 paid subscription on my PS4 system, or do I need two subscriptions?
You only need to pay one monthly subscription for the account, regardless of how many systems you use with that account, but you do need a PS4 copy of the game added to your account. As an existing PS3 user, you have two options: 1) You can purchase a PS4 copy of the game and register that copy to your existing Square Enix account (the same one you use from PS3). This would then allow you to log into the game from either system, your PS3 or PS4. As this involves another purchase of the game, you would also receive another 30 days of subscription time "free" (which is their way of saying "included with the purchase price") or 2) You can transfer your existing PS3 service to PS4. To do this, log into your Square Enix account at the MogStation, select "Playstation4 Upgrade", and follow the prompts. This transfer is free of charge (until the end of 2014), but once the transfer is complete, you would no longer be able to log in to the game from your PS3. (And since there's no additional purchase with this option, there's no additional 30 days, either.)
Do i need to use my credit card to redeem the free month?
As far as I know (since I had signed up for an account when it was in beta) you do not. In fact, that's one of the highlights of this game. Unlike Elder Scrolls where you do.
The PS4 version comes with a free 1-month subscription. Do I still have put in my credit card information in order to use the 1-month free subscriptio
No
Do you have to buy a subscription to play this game?
Yes.
Can the PS4 version play cross-platform with PC?
Yep, and with the PS3 version too! Just make sure you're on the same server (known as "Worlds").
If I own the pc version, and decide to buy the ps4 version can I still play my with same account from the pc version?
You can play in any of the systems with your character and data, the only thing that is required is the license (code) for that system. same will apply with the expansion when its released. So to answer your question yes if you have Final Fantasy XIV ARR for PC and you buy the game for PS4 you can play on both systems.
How much is the monthly fee
i believe its 15 a month
does this game have co op?
Sure does, that's one of its major features. I play it with my child often.
Can 2 or more players play at the same time?
Yes 2 players can play at the same time.
is this compatible with xbox 360?
The portal and disc will not work on the xbox360, the figures will work across platforms. I have both 360 and the Xbox one and interchange the figures regularly.
are the characters compatible with the old Wii?
characters are usable on any system, just depends on the game, newer games support all while older games support up to the games' release.
Does this include the actual disk to play the game, or just the characters?
The game disk is also included
My grandsons have the trap team portal. Do they need this portal and disk to play the swap team characters?
I believe so, yes. This is my first purchase, but my nephew has the trap team and those characters do not work with this.
The portal of power in last generation (PS3/360) was wired. Is this portal wireless?
It is wired. If it wasn't you would go through a lot of batteries. Trust me we have the ds version.
does it only come with the same three characters, or are there choices
These are the starter pack characters. I'm not aware of any choices. They're included in the box.
If you already have a portal of power from sky landers Giants, do you need this portal of power or do they work the same from the other installments?
I'm not sure about the portal, but I know the figures work with each game.

Sure does, that's one of its major features. I play it with my child often.
Can 2 or more players play at the same time?
Yes 2 players can play at the same time.
is this compatible with xbox 360?
The portal and disc will not work on the xbox360, the figures will work across platforms. I have both 360 and the Xbox one and interchange the figures regularly.
are the characters compatible with the old Wii?
characters are usable on any system, just depends on the game, newer games support all while older games support up to the games' release.
Does this include the actual disk to play the game, or just the characters?
The game disk is also included

What Len songs are there?
The songs Len has in the game are "FIRE FLOWER", "DREAM EATING MONOCROME BAKU", and a duet with RIN in "REMOTE CONTROL".

It has vibration feedback, but not true force feedback such as you'll find in the Logitech G27 and higher-end wheels. Meaning it rattles and shakes, but has no "pull" like a real car wheel.

I don't know. I just have used it on my PS3 and my laptop. I can tell you that it works pretty good!

is it good\precise enough to play .. MAME driving games on pc ?
works good for me on midtown madness. I use auto transmission and park brake on one of the paddle/levers. I am 50 years old and this is my 2nd wheel--broke the paddles on the first one (it was a Saitek?) this one is very good for the price but I am not a gamer. just use it for midtown madness and it works great. the accelerator pedal is a little upright (too tall). I only use accelerator hand brake/park brake and one of the toggle buttons for screen changes. there are other buttons but my game is 12 years old and has no use for them. I like the suction cups and do not use the clamps because they hit my knees under the slide out table (keyboard slider board under the desk) that i set the unit on. I bought for the price and was expecting crap but am very happy with it.
Is this thhe global version or in USA only ?
Yes is it. I'm from Chile, so it worjed perfect on Steam. Enjoy it!
what controller is best to play this game on PC?
I'm using an Xbox 360 controller and it works perfectly, no hassle. Just plug in and that's it.
Is this a Steam game? Not just a game you can add to Steam, but an actual Steam game, as in Steam will acknowledge it has been purchased?
Yes it is an actual steam game, not a non-steam game. Achievements and all the other Steam related things work fine.
i have windows 8.1 will these game work or do i need to buy the disk
I downloaded it through Steam and it works just fine with Windows 8.1.
not opening and im trying to get help but NOBODY is helping me..I have windows 8????
Having Windows 8 should not cause any issues. Do you have Steam installed? If so, go into your steam folder, find the game, and run MK Launcher.exe(C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/MortalKombat_KompleteEdition/DiscContentPC/MK Launcher.exe) If this doesn't work, uninstall it and reinstall it through Steam, as sometimes the game attempts to launch before the necessary files have been downloaded.
Can you gift the PC download version? If so how?
Yes. U will get code for activation on STEAM. Just give someone this code.
The download includes the game or just the code to play online?
hi, is the code. you need to download the game from your steam account after using this code. (sorry for my poor english)
Can this game can be run Locally on my Pc? I dont like to play online, I prefer play against myself.
Yes you can play the game offline, if you have 2 usb ports you can plug in 2 controllers and play against your friends as well &#128522;
How is the online in this game? is it worth it?
I've played through Steam with friends, and works like a charm. Latency can be an issue if whoever hosts has a bad internet connection, but otherwise it's fine.
Where do i input the product key? cause im trying to put enter it into steam but it says invalid key
Happened with me too but I found a game Neverwinter that's free and have been playing for months now.

Is this game independent of Steam?
No. It is ran through Steam.
Got my code today on the 22nd.... But I wont be able to download until the 25th? Correct? thanks
You can download it right now, but won't be able to play it until the 25th.
Should I play this with a touch screen?
If you did and completed the game, you would be honored as a hero.
Will Dark Souls II run on my Surface Pro? I see that the old DS would run just fine on the surface pro
I don't see why not, all you need to do is check the specs of your surface pro and check the pc requirements of DS2. You may not be able to completely max it out, but it should run just fine
does it require a steam aqqount?
Yes it does.
I've been running Dark Souls on my surface pro 2 with no problems... Can my surface handle Dark Souls 2?
People have reported that the game is playable on low settings with Intel HD 4000 chipset at 20-30 fps. I could not play Dark Souls 2 at 20 fps but others may be happy with that. Be aware that when pushing older hardware to its max you may get other issues like crashes, stutters, artifacts, or over heating.
Is it worth buying on PC if I already own it for PS3?
It depends...if you like eye candy then yes. The game looks and runs amazing at 60fps. The content is identical though
Does anyone know if this game will support using a PS4 controller with my PC? I just don't have a wired 360 controller and don't want to buy one xD
If it's a usb controller, yes.
I am living in venezuela, i cant buy the digital game?
yo recin lo compre amigo cambia el producto o el cdigo que te den en steam y lo podrs jugar como si nada. Muy bueno el juego y bastante difcil por un lado.
Is the PC pre-order version the Black Armor Edition? It says it's DRM Steam and Steam is providing digital: weapons, soundtrack, artbook, and comic.
It's basically the black armor edition only you don't get the exclusive metal case it's all digital.

if you mean vibration, yes it does
how is this controller for playing lego lord of the rings pc game
This controller is one of the best I have ever purchased, but if you need to modify the button layout because you find it uncomfortable or counter-intuitive there are a few programs that will modify the button layout. For example, x360ce is a very simple program to use (I use it for all of my games). It forces the game to think that the controller is an Xbox 360 controller so it is compatible with any and all games that use that controller as it's primary means. Just drop it in the folder with the LEGO LOTR executable (.exe) and run it, basically. Note: This program is not endorsed by Amazon. Beyond that, this controller feels a lot like a PS2 controller. So if you like that "feel," you'll love this controller.
where is the link to download the program that helps it run
sadly i don't think there is one. you need to use the cd that comes with the package
does it comes with its own gamepad software?
I didn't look at the provided mini-CD, which I assume has the device drivers for Windows XP or earlier, because I don't have a DVD drive on my system and I've thrown out the CD. Someone else might be able to help you with that. There are a few free ones around the Internet, like joy2key, but I haven't used them personally. The MAME emulator seems to pick up and use the game controller just fine without them. I also only have a small number of PC games, but they either use XBox controller or can use the built-in Windows driver directly.
Would this controller work for my laptop that has Windows 8.1? If not do you have any suggestions on a controller that will?
It works on my computer with Win8.1
Would this work with a surface rt?
It should as long as you are able to download motioninjoy a program that can be used with the controller as a driver to simulate ps3 or even xbox 360 controllers. so I would test to see if the application works with your device before buying if that is the only reason to get this controller.
What Games can you use this for?
Pretty much anything that is not locked to a specific game type
Does it work for windows 8?
I talk to etekcity directly and they said it does work for windows 8 but not windows 8.1 or higher. If you like my response please follow TwistedSaiyan on twitter and like us on facebook and subscribe to us on YouTube because we are apart of a special beta test program with Etekcity.
Are the analog sticks variable rate or just on/off switches? (I need variable rates for my racing games)
Variable rate
Does the ps4 edition offer exclusive content?
No, but it runs 1080p native on ps4 where xbox one upscales to 1080p. People say you can't really see the difference, but the game developers did say there were occasions where the xbox one engine slowed down to keep up with 1080p 60fps upscaling
Sorry, first game I buy for PS4, is this the digital download or physical version of the game?
This is the physical version of the game.
Just getting into these games; are there levels of difficulty on this game so a newbee can learn easily???
Very much so!
Is this game multiplayer co-op?
No.
Are there boss fights in this game?
Yes a few
is their a monthly subscription needed for this game
Nop
Is this game region locked?
no way, go to all regiosn Pen !
How many gb does this game take up?
The box says 49gb minimum.
If i buy this now will it come with the doom beta?
It came with mine. I bought it last week.
Does this have the "Legacy" control options ("turn" on left thumbstick and "strafe" right thumbstick), please?
I believe so yes, I played around with the controls once and I think there was a lefty option.
Is This Wireless?
No.
Does it come with software to configure the programmable keys? If not what software did you use to configure them, and was it easy?
It comes with instructions on how to program - no software necessary as far as I know - looks like a series of keystrokes. Love this keyboard so far. Only complaint I have is that it didn't tilt up enough for me.
how do you turn the keyboard lights on
When you plug in the usb to your pc/laptop they automatically light up !!!
How do I control the keyboards LED's?
The FN button next to the right alt key, push and hold that and then press the escape key while holding the FN key.
Is the clicking on the keyboard quiet?
It's ok quiet not anything to loud! I think it's a great keyboard!
whats the length of the keyboard?my desk only holds a 18.5" max keyboard
19.13"
How can I get the backlights to turn on? Fn + ESC does not do it?
They turn on a boot up, but go off after awhile, and F+ ESC does not work for me either. I'm about to junk it, wasted money.
Why don't the Keyboard lights go off when my computer gores to sleep, but they go off when I wake up my computer?
I have the same issue, then I just unplug the cable.
what type of mechanical keyboard is it? black cherry, blue, brown, etc
It is NOT a mechanical keyboard, I don't know why people answer without knowing this. It is a digital nub sensor keyboard.
Is this mechanical?
People need to stop answering questions that they have no idea the answer to. This keyboard is not mechanical. Most mechanical keyboards retail for over $80 minimum. This keyboard is a digital nub sensor.
Does it work with any flight simulator .. for example flight simulator x standard
Yes, It will work for any flight simulator, or for any game you would fly aircraft. The Wheel Stand is use to mount your hardware (Yoke. Rudder Pedals), and it does not matter what game you are playing. The Stand works perfectly and is easy to move.
Does the vertical pole swivel further forward? In pics, it's angled at 80 degrees to the ground; can you make it 120 degrees?
YES YOU PUT IT AT ANY ANGLE YOU WISH.
This model is also compatible Wheel Thrustmaster T300RS?
No...if it doesn't say the wheel you are looking for in the title then it is not compatible with that wheel.
can you ship by dhl
No
Will this work for MS Flight Sim Gold for Windows 8.1?
Wheel stand pro is a stand to mount other controls such as flight yoke or race car steering wheel to. All of the instruments are sold separately. The stand is very well made and will take a lot of abuse.
This question is more about the whole system: yolk, throttles, rudder pedals, trim control, and instruments. Do these components work with a Mac.
I sell the stand only. I do not sell the Saitek yoke etc. Here is a link that may be helpful. http://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=37064 Thanks, Lucy
Will this work with Saiteks Throttle, Pitch and Mixture System (TPM)? Be able to mount it?
Yes
Dose this work with the x box 360. Can you use it with the x box 360
No, I don't see how it could
Will this work with Google Earth flight simulator?
This is just a stand. Not the whole set of hardwares.
Will this stand support the Saitek X55 Rhino
Wheel stand Pro can certainly support the Rhino, if you can get the platforms to interface (sit the controllers on) to the wheel stand.
Does this include the belt?
Yes the belt comes with it
What controllers are supported?
Regular wii remote is inserted in belt.
If I want to use this with a friend or family member do we need two belts?
You could have them hold the controller but it will Calculate their score/calories differently since it typically calculates based on the hip movement. But if you want accuracy then yes you'd need another belt
Will the belt fit plus sized women??
Yes
Which system is it? NTSC or PAL?
NTSC
does the game require wii motion plus
This game works on the wii u an long as you have all the pieces that go with the wii u there is nothing additional needed to run the game
I am in a wheelchair, does it work if you use the arm band or by holding the remote? If I was to wear the belt higher, in theory would it work?
you can hold the remote
does it come with a belt?
Yes it does!
How much room do I need to move around in? I have a tiny living room area :-) Thx!
I do this in my bedroom and its small. I have no problem. Sometimes I have to modify the motions but its only in travelling moves
does the wii u version have any special features? or is it exactly the same as the wii version?
I'm not sure bc I've never played world party on regular wii...the graphics on wii u are amazing
can this controller be used for all ps3 games
Yes, as long as the game doesn't require you to use sixaxis motion controls. This dose not have motion controls like the standard ps3 controller so you might have trouble playing games like sly4
How long is the wire?
It's about 8-10 feet.
Does it work with GTAV?
This controller will work with any game that doesnt require motion function(like the original six axis ps3 controller is capable of) so games like Killzone 2 are going to be unplayable in sections(arming bombs and whatnot) GTAV is good to go, have fun
Would this controller work on a PS4?
Not sure if you can use for ps4 its not wireless
How about deadzone? too big?
I haven't found a deadzone on mine and I've been using it on BF4. I don't know if this is indicative of mine or not but I am pleased with my controller. It is very well built. I hope this helps.
Does this controller have sixaxis support? Thanks
Unfortunately, no. As far as controllers go, it has no advantages over the original PS3 other than comfort but even that is dashed because the tiny shoulder buttons sometimes pinch fingers.
Will this function as a Windows PC gamepad?
It does. but pc doesn't read the button scheme like the other ps3 controllers. it reads it like a X-box 360 controller. In fact I don't have to customize controls for steam's rouge legacy, or even most of steam's games.
Is this for the original wii or for the wiiu?
This is for the original Wii. The Wii version will work on the Wii U, but not vice versa.
Is this version user friendly to new Zumba goers?
Yes it's fun
Is the zumba fitness belt required for this game? If so, does this game come with the belt or is it an additional purchase?
Yes, the belt is necessary BUT it already comes included with the game. I found this out after I purchased an additional belt. I love this zumba though! Have fun!
Dance Dance Rev games will "boo" and stop the game if you do badly. Does Zumba travel through the whole song regardless of how Awful you are doing?
It always plays through the entire song. If you're doing well, you get more background dancers and the scene lights up more. If you start doing poorly later on, the extra dancers will disappear and the scene will go back to the original style.
Does it come with a Zumba fitness belt?
Yes, the belt is included.
How does this game compare to the Zumba workout DVDs? If you're a total beginner, which would you recommend trying first?
I haven't done the Zumba videos. I like the game because it walks you through most of the steps, scores you based on how well you follow the steps and keeps track of your progress.
does this promote weight loss
Yes, I have lost over 40lbs in 5 months doing the elliptical for about 50 minutes in the morning and doing a full hour of Zumba in the evening anywhere between 4-7 days a week. I was more consistentl with Zumba precisely because it was so much fun while getting a great calorie burn. Don't be too concerned about staying on beat, my motto was as long as I was moving I was burning and I lost going from a size 14-16 to down to a size 6-8 in only 5 months!
If you don't want to play the game, but just use it as a Zumba video, will it still play? (For example, no one is holding a remote.)
You don't really have to hold the remote, the video comes with a belt for you to put the remote in while working out.
does is comes with a belt
It didn't, I already had one.
does this game come with the belt
Yes it does
Does this keyboard have mechanical keys?
It doesn't but the keys are very responsive with the price considered.
When will there be more?
RIGHT NOW
are the keys themselves illuminated? does the actual letters light up or is it just backlight around the keys? just making sure
The keys light up. The letters also light up blue as well as under the keys. It's a pretty good mouse and keyboard I like mine.
is this compatible with mac ?
Not on my Mac. The keys work, but the light won't. No problem on Windows though.
Can you Turn off the BackLit LED anytime or no? And does the mouse have LED as well. Can I turn that off as well. What is the warranty on this?
You can turn on and off the LED back light on the keyboard using the scroll lock button. The mouse is permanently lit; no on and off button. I'm not sure about the warranty.
How loud of sound do the keys on the keyboard make when typing? Does it give off a loud "click clacky" sound when typing?
Yea I like it that way but it's definetly not quiet
Does it like, have anti-ghosting?
Not that I'm aware of, but in my case its the individual characters that don't respond.
Does this keyboard have a matte finish? Or is it just plastic?
Has a nice matte finish, some parts of the keyboard are glossy for looks but it doesn't look like cheap glossy plastic. Keys feel nice. Outside of the keys doesnt feel as nice as the keys but it doesnt feel cheap, its nice and sturdy. Looks good.
How's the tactile feedback on the kb? im trying to decide between this and an EasyAcc Mechanical-like gaming keyboard (not really mechanical)
The Tactile feedback is great! Right when you press the keys it snaps just like a mechanical, also if you like the sound mechanical keyboards make you would like this one. I have never seen or used an EasyAcc keyboard but I think you would love this keyboard :D
How long are the cords for each piece?
They're about 6 feet long.
How is the voice quality to others?
My daughter said the quality is FANTASTIC. I talk outside the room they are playing their games and the person on the other end can hear me clear as a bell. She said you can hear everything. They are well made. They are definately worth the price. There were 2 in the package and I bought 2. I gave them 1 and I have 3 put away. My kids were going through 1 headset every 2 Months. Maybe more. Un like the cheap ones you get with XBOX, which have only one side for hearing and they were cheap with the band around the head, these are like stereo headphones with both ears with cushions (real cushions not that cheap black stuff) and a Mic that has metal around the bendable stick part. All in all,this was a great find as far as I am concerned, and I am very happy that I purchAsed them. I'm sure you will be happy too !!
Can you hear the game sounds rather than using tv volume? I am new to this and hope gran kids can play quietly
Sadly no. The speakers are used for listening to the friends you're playing with.
Does the volume box move up so its not so close to where ya plug it ino the controller??
No it doesn't. It's part of the plug assembly.
Can this be used with the Xbox 360 wireless controller?
Yes my boyfriends uses his with his wireless controller it works perfect he loves it but you need an xbox online account to talk but the mic is awesome I recommend this mic it came early and works
can this display volume
It has a volume conto on the cord. Slider wheel.
Can this plug into the chatpad?
yes...only the wireless controllers...i don't recommend this item..They came in my home out right out the package broke...never got to use them
Does this have a mute button or switch?
Yes
Where do you plug in the headsets for xbox 360? To the controller? I don't see a place for plug in on it.
Small hole at bottom of controller. Under the bottom of where battery pack plugs in.
is it compatable with xbox 360 slim?
Yess it plugs in thee controller
is it compatable with xbox 360 slim?
I don't think the system matters because it's the controllers that you attach the headset to.
how many cords to i have to deal with?
One short. One long
is it compatible with wii?
yes
Does the headset acutally connect to an Xbox 360 controller? For chat?
It does it hooks up to the xbox controller and the computer so you can hear the game and chat.
can it record with the roxio game capture standarded
yes it can
Do you need any extra cords or items to use with xbox 360
no actually I've been trying to get in touch with you guys because the mic does not work what can I do about that
does it work for the xbox one .3.
Yes it does.
How do I get the chat to work with my ps3?
Go to Accessory Settings in the settings tab in the main dashboard. Choose the Audio Device Settings option. Change the Input Device to the dream gear option and the output device should automatically change to the input device.
does this work for the ps4?
Yes but I recommend you get something stress bend kinda sucks
does it work perfectly with xbox 360 controller do I have to do anything special and can I use it for a PS3 IPhone and PC??
Its alright I wouldn't get it again for its price.
so it works with the xbox 360 controller perfectly and i dont have to do anything special and does it work with anything else like PS3 IPhones PC
It works on my iPod and laptop perfectly and on ps3 n xbox
Why are all dragon ball fighting games? Where can i purchase role playing DB games?
Dragon Ball Z Attack of the Saiyans for the Nintendo DS.
Does this game have a story/ free- roaming mode? Like, where you can collect dragon balls? And can you fuse characters/items to create new characters?
1.) No unfortunately mission is like story mode, No open world. 2.) There is no Gathering Dragon Ball (only online to win, but no wish). 3.) No fuse/items to make new character. Recommend Old DBZ game like DBZ B3 or U.T
For dragon ball z battle of z is it in english or japanese when they speak?
English.
Is the offline mode single player only? My son wants this game, but I'm pretty sure he will want me to play couch co-op with him if possible.
I'm sorry to bring the bad news but yes, playing offline mode is single player only. The only way to play together would be to play online with another system and game :(

There is no Dub in Spanish. It only has subtitles in spanish.
Can this CD work in Playstation 4
I wanna say no because I believe they made a version for the PlayStation 4.

I don't know, I gave this DVD to someone for gift.
you get to play all these versions FOR 20 BUCKS?
Yes
will this work with win 8.1? Thank you.
Yes, I had to run it in compatibility mode to get it to run well and have better control the scrolling.
Will these games work with controllers (such as the xBox 360 controller w/ PC wireless adapter) ?
No. Though you can probably make them work if you really want to, you would essentially need to set up your controller to control a mouse pointer. These are all RTS strategy games (with the exception of "Renegade"). I can't even imagine any situation where a controller would be preferable to a mouse with an RTS strategy game. They were never designed with that controller in mind.
Will this download work on Windows XP?
Hello Andrew, All games work on XP (sorry for my english)
do you have to make some stupid online account to play this game
EA Origin account required
Can I play multiplayer games? online games?
I don't think the online servers are still there (I have never tried to access them) - CNC 4 may be an exception. You can play multi-player on an internal network.
will it work on mac???
I dont know but, found this info from KrittMasta, No, this is strictly working on Windows. Unless you run Windows emulator (Vine) or something on Mac, you can't play this game. You'll need a mouse to play. It would be very effective if you have a fullsize keyboard with it. Other than that, sorry.
can you play this offline?
I never got it to download from EA. DON'T BUY IT. Amazon will NOT REFUND YOU
will these games work on windows 8?
They do work on windows 8, matter of fact, that's what I play them on.
What is the file size of this download?
There are 17 different titles to download. Each ranges between 650mb to 4gb depending on the title i think. I have not downloaded all of them at once... i hope that helps

Is the game just in english or also in german?
Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. I remember there are different language to select but not sure if German was available. I tried to search for it on the internet but I cannot confirm. I'm unable to confirm it as my house is under construction so my playstation 4 cannot be used at the moment.
I am disabled and I want to make sure I can play this game, can someone please tell me the button layout for the ps4 version...
I believe the controls are customizable but the defaults are (this taken from the manual): Directional Buttons/Left Stick : Move Character L1/R1 : Toggle between characters in free play Triangle : Change Char / Hold to X-form in to a big LEGO figure Square: Attack / Shoot / Hold to Aim Circle : Build / Use / Activate / Special Ability or Weapon X : Jump / Double tap to hover, double jump, or combat roll Right Stick : Move Camera R3 : Look / Rotate Map Touchpad : Map Options Button : Pause / In-game options Hope this helps you decide. It's a great game.

Will this work with a gaming console such as a ps4 or xbox one?
Although I have no knowledge of those boxes I do know if they have micro usb audio output or bluetooth audio then it should work. If no micro usb audio out then perhaps an adaptor to go from phone jack to that? You'd have to check with a place like RadioShack to help you for such things. Also there's such a thing as phone jack to bluetooth transmitters. Hope that helps.
Odd question, I use Spotify instead of iTunes on my iPod Touch...is this ok or must music run through iTunes?
These hook up with Bluetooth and will play anything including telephone conversations and they also have a microphone. It doesn't matter what you play through them.
does it come with a charger
Yes...
I have a Sony non Bluetooth CD player and I was going to order a Bluetooth transmitter for it. Will these headphones pickup from that transmitter?
Yes they Will connect to any other blues tooth device
Can you wear it in the rain?
I have worn mine in the rainrain with no ill affect
All I really want to know (after buying this of course) is if you can listen to the radio as well as downloading your own music. Please advise!!
According to your radio device, if radio FM signal is good, then the sound will be very good.
So, can you listen to music you've downloaded but can you just listen to a radio station?
Musicjogger just can listen to music with bleutooth device, not included with TF/Micro card, and sorry that aslo can not listen to radio station itself unless by your mobile phone
can it connect to multiple devices ? or need to unpair previous device before connecting to another ?
yes, can connect with multiple devices, just need to turn off previous device bluetooth, and then can connnect to another
I have a Kindle Fire HDX 7 (3rd generation) will these headphones work with it?
I believe as long as you have Bluetooth in the Kindle it should work, then again I only used on Apple products.
how are these for running on treadmill? want something thats secure and wont fall off when im running
The headphones are pretty tightly bound to your head for comfortable fit while running.
Would this pouch fit the New Nintendo 3DS XL?
Yes
I have a 3ds with a small case on it. Would it fit well inside of this carrying case?
I would think so. But I wouldn't know for sure, I only have an XL 3DS. But I don't see why it wouldn't be able to.
is a product for the "new 3ds xl" ?, because the new 3ds xl it's bigger than a nomal 3ds xl
It fits both.
will this case fit the dsi xl?
It fits the 3DS XL, so it should fit the DSi XL
Can you fit the charger in the case as well ?
No you can not.
Is this made to hold the 3ds XL during gameplay or is it just a storage case? Thanks in advance!
Nope, just storage.
Will a regular 3ds fit well in this case? Would it have too much room and slide around?
Honestly I don't know. I've never put a regular sized one in. Sold mine forever ago. But I'd assume that it would be fine. From my memory the older 3DS, while smaller, was a tad thicker. And since this case has a strap on the inside that should hold it in place. And even then, if it did start moving around you could always try using one of those protective hard shell casings. Hope this helps.

A regular 3DS will, in fact, fit in this case. While it is designed with the XL in mind, it holds pretty firm so you shouldn't have to worry about too much sliding around. There are smaller cases for the standard size 3DS too.
Is this case compatible with the New 3DS XL?
Yes, that's what I got it for and it is a perfect fit.
Would this pouch fit the New Nintendo 3DS XL?
Yes
I have a 3ds with a small case on it. Would it fit well inside of this carrying case?
I would think so. But I wouldn't know for sure, I only have an XL 3DS. But I don't see why it wouldn't be able to.
is a product for the "new 3ds xl" ?, because the new 3ds xl it's bigger than a nomal 3ds xl
It fits both.
will this case fit the dsi xl?
It fits the 3DS XL, so it should fit the DSi XL
Can you fit the charger in the case as well ?
No you can not.
Is this made to hold the 3ds XL during gameplay or is it just a storage case? Thanks in advance!
Nope, just storage.
Will a regular 3ds fit well in this case? Would it have too much room and slide around?
Honestly I don't know. I've never put a regular sized one in. Sold mine forever ago. But I'd assume that it would be fine. From my memory the older 3DS, while smaller, was a tad thicker. And since this case has a strap on the inside that should hold it in place. And even then, if it did start moving around you could always try using one of those protective hard shell casings. Hope this helps.

Does this game have multiplayer mode?
yes, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8sryFIcank
Is the included artbook the same book as this? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781...
Similar but just as good.
Hey guys ran into a problem with the Code what does the code give you in this Edition please thanks?
I am assuming you are talking about the puzzel code that pops up through out the game. Once you solve one of these it usually gives you access to Cameras which allows you to hack certain areas. Some of these codes are relatively easy and some are not (they get tougher as you progress through the game). I was lucky enough to score one of the Limited Edition Hardback guides (almost 3" thick) and it goes into great detail on each of the individual codes and shows you exactly how to complete them. Without this guide I would have been completely lost. This is one of the most intense games that I have ever owned and takes a great deal of patience to play but very satisfying at at the end. I hope my comments help.
Is this a non-stop violence game? I find most games to have too much story and that's boring. I like just pure violence.
The thing with this game is that, as an open world game, you pretty much dictate what to do. If you follow the story you will be given specific missions and cutscenes are expected, but if you dont you can pretty much create the mayhem you want and be chased by the police. Besides it, there is a mode to use a giant mechanical spider...pretty cool. It is not by any means an alternative to GTA or Saints Row as it is not as polished and structured as those ones. but its pretty fun.
Is it possible to play this side by side/split screen rather than online multiplayer?
you can't afford ps plus?

Does it work with mac?
Yup!
Does the scroll wheel click to intervals, or is it completely smooth?
It clicks as you scroll
Does the mouse make noise when clicking or is it silent?
Yes it does make a slight clicking noise with all buttons. Its somewhat quieter than most and definitly quieter than just about every keyboard I have owned but you will eventually not even hear it all after a short while. The buttons have a nice feedback feel to them and if you have small hands such as I because I am a shorter person than average the mouse will feel a little big to you but all in all I like it.
Can you adjust the polling rates?
On my mouse i can it has options for 125 hz. 250hz 500 or 1000 in the settings menu
Do you ship to New Zealand ?
No sorry
What are the dimensions?
Its a regular palm mouse. I threw it in the trash 3 months ago because it stopped working after 6 months. Its the same size as the razor epic chroma mouse that I now have.
Is there a time frame when the driver will allow you to choose any color?
The dpi is set to a specific color by default. You change te default colors and dpi by pressing the dpi button on the mouse. You can customize the colors by using the software that is included.
Does anyone know how to use the software that comes with the mouse. For some reason, I can't seem to find it.
http://www.utechsmart.com/index.php?s=/Download
I just ordered 2 of these. How do I request different colors?
You can change the colors via software as you like.
Does this mouse have any prediction or acceleration?
The mouse has a DPI button below the scroll button and you get to choose what speed you would like your mouse to move at.
Are all nintendo DS games compatible with the 3DS XL ?
Yes
adapter
Yes, there was an adapter that came with the ds.
Will the new one come with an sd card, wall charger, stylus, etc?
Yeah. It comes with a SD Card, charger and a stylus.
What region : USA, JP or EU?
USA
Can you get netflix etc on the 3DS xL
You can.
What system firmware is this model?
as of May 13, 2014 (5/13/14) the firmware version is 7.1.0-16U
is this the new nintendo 3ds xl? and if so how can i be sure its not a knock off or fake?
I don't think so. It's discounted and the pictures don't show the second analog stick on the right. I guess Amazon isn't selling it before it launches on the 13th.
Can you play retro NES, SNES and N64 games with this?
No it cant play them. Only plays DS, DSi, and 3DS games. But some games have been rereleased as a game for DS. Example the classic sonic the hedgehog games got released as "sonic classics" a DS tittle. "Namco museum DS" is another good DS game, it rereleases old arcade games like "galega" and " Pac-Man".
How do I check the region for this console and its games? If I bought all of the games inside the US, will they belong to the same region?
That depends. If you bought them from a normal local vendor (one based in the US), they will almost surely be from that region. However, if you buy them from a pawn shop or from a person, it is possible they won't be. This has never been an issue for me since the dawn of video games. I do suggest that you simply be careful when purchasing games on websites that are completely in another language as it is very likely the games will be from another region. My brother made that mistake and assumed the game would work on his English version console. Considering that the game was only released in Japan though, it should have been obvious.
can you play games without wifi?
Yes
Does this player have typical internet access such as facebook?
why would you even ask this? it's a "retro" version of an old school game gear. not everything needs facebook or wifi lol
this may be a stupid question but can it play sega genesis cartriges?
My girlfriend ordered it as a gift. From my understanding. It's a standalone handheld sega. So no sega games needed they are on it. Hope it helps
Can this system emulate games other than Genesis, like SNES?
No, if u want multi system emulation get the JXD-S5110b. Just type it into Amazon and you'll see the PS4 clone that emulates multiple systems from the 8 and 16 bit eras, I think it does N64 also
what year did this come out?
My sealed box states a production year of 2013 on the box label. I do not know what year it was first produced. Maybe check out the company website, www.atgames.us, for more information.
can you save your game progress?
No
how many hours of game play do you have on a full charge?
Not sure, but way more efficient than the emulator on my phone. Lower power needed for display, I suspect. Great back seat entertainment device for road trips.
what games are on it??
read the reviews.
what size sd card is needed to download games?
You can use a small one. The rom files are tiny by today's standards. I think no more that a gig is needed, you could even get a considerable library of games onto 256k or 512k. g\Good luck finding one that small nowadays, though.
Can you Get sega CD games on this Device or only the 16bit ? and how hard is it to down load games ?
This was a gift but I think the games were built into system
does this model have Megaman willey wars ?
It's not a built in game, no.
Can you plug an iPhone etc (3.5) jack into the headset and listen to xbox audio and iPhone audio simultaneously?
I forgot to tell you that I was using a splitter on mine. The head set plugs into the controller for power no batteries for the head set. But the part that plugs into the controller has a 3.5 plug on. Because you can unplug the head set and plug it straight into your iPhone and it works. There is also another cord Polk sent me for free that is for use with a phone and it has a built in mic... Hope this helped a little.
Is Polk Audio 4Shot Headphone - Black - Xbox One wireless?
yes, it comes with an adapter that plugs into the controller.
I use the Xbox One to watch TV, when I use the TV app does it play through the headsets?
I believe it will I've watched movies and Netflix with them the only problem is the controller shuts off if you don't move the joystick or press a button every 5 min or so and if that happens you will not have sound.
does audio pass over usb on the xbox one?
No just through the controller but you get dts sound quality
Does these include the boom mic?
Actually they will call you and confirm you received the boom mic
Did the controller update with little to no improvement for my mic. Did you guys have the same issue?
Honestly, I didn't see any difference
I've heard that there are issues with the Chat Pro mic giving feedback (echoing) to the user. Is this true?
My worked just fine but it was horrible having a cheap add on mic to a beautifully made headset with pop up mic which didn't work, so I don't want to use it any more... I have since spent 200 more to have a headset work as intended (Sennheiser G4ME ONE)
Would the Turtle Beach Ear Force Headset Audio Controller for Xbox One give this headset mic monitoring? It gives Turtle beach headset mic monitoring.
I can't you an absolute yes or no, but all I know is that you tend to talk louder cause you can't hear yourself talking. The headset is awesome, the clarity of the sounds from the game is over the top. Plus you can hear things like the phone ringing or that someone wants to talk to you is great. Hope this helps.
Did any of you get an notification that your boom mic was on the way? I registered my product and never received an email from Polk.
I never got anything. I think they've stopped caring. It would help if they showed what it looked like. I even called them, spoke with someone who said I'd get an email with tracking but I never got anything.
How do you get the feet off? I've tried taking out a screw from the back and puling on them from every angle. Nothing on the manual on how to do this.
I wondered the same thing! From polk customer service: "If you look at the bottom of the feet, there is a rubber pad. Simply pull the rubber pad back, it's held on with double sided tape. Once they're removed, there are 2 screws that hold the foot to the bar. It's that easy!"
will this work on a lg smart tv? thanks
It should. I have one and I connect it via optical audio.
26.5 pounds ? but other webside said it just 4kg,are you sure about this?
I would say its less than 10lbs....shipping is under 15 lbs with all of the packaging
Anyone know if there's any issues using this with a PS4? I'm guessing probably not. It's just audio inputs, etc.
There are no issues I have a PS4, and it works great with it.
how do you change the modes?
modes? Do u mean halo, forza,movie? Use remote or function buttons on soundbar
What is frequency responce?
Check this link out: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_response
Will this work ok as a center speaker for a 7.1 surround sound system? I already have a Polk subwoofer and other speakers for the system.
I don't believe it will work as part of a surround sound setup. The input is optical and so I don't believe you can setup the amp to output via the optical port the centre speaker.
Is this an ok front center speaker for a 7.1 surround sound system?
No
which polk audio sound bar is best for movies?
This one is great for everything, in my opinion, I watch a lot of action movies, space battles, and it delivers.
does it come with or is it wall mountable?
It has feet at the bottom to allow it to sot on a table, but it does have portrait slots on each side to allow it hang from the wall like a picture
storage capacity?
16gb
Is there a Micro SD card port to add content (music files, etc.); and could I download to the console from Google Play, etc?
Yes. There is a micro SD card port in the back that supports up to 32 Gb. 64 GB microSD comes with exFAT format that is not supported on any android system. If you want to use 64Gb, you need to format the 64 GB microSD card to FAT32 using your PC or Mac computer.
Is it true Android emulators have 1000 ms of audio lag?
I've never had a problem with mine.audio works great
is it any good
I bought this expecting not to use it much i just like hand held games , I got it to stream from my pc which works very well , however i didnt expect to be playing android games on it , but i find myself playing them all the time . I also use it as a emulator through android apps so now i have access to all the games for older systems such as n64, nintendo, psp, playstation, sega ,just about anything you can find an emulator for also i can hook up the xbox 360 wireless dongle and hook it up to the tv and play multiplayer games like twisted metal, or i can just play my computer games on the big screen in the living room it all works very well, they keep it up to date and are adding alot more features like pc streaming outside of youre home network. I would never hesitate to buy another one and ill buy any newer versions they come out with. there is also a nvidia grid feature that they are testing which allows you to stream games from nvidias server and it works great with my internet connection and is free to do right now they have several good titles, this is by far the best quality hand held you will find i didnt think the controller would be very comfortable because it looked weird in the pictures but it is a very comfortable controller . needless to say I love my shield and would recommend it to anyone.
what kind of videocard does it have?
The GPU is an Nvidia GeForce ULP (Ultra Low Power) with a total of 72 cores (48 pixel shader cores, 24 vertex shader cores) and 4 graphics pipelines. "Tegra 4" is the name of the SoC (system on a chip), which contains the CPU, GPU, memory controller and I/O controller.
Which are the best native games available for the Shield?
The best games for NVIDIA SHIELD that I like are GT Racing 2, Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2, Modern Combat 4, N.O.V.A 3, Fractal Combat X, Minigore 2: Zombies and Virtual Tennis. All of them are totally controled by Nvidia Shield...
I have two question: is it able to play offline any game? does support steam application?
You can play some Android games offline that don't require an Internet connection. It does support the Android steam application, but I don't think you can launch games from the mobile steam application.
So how does the game streaming work exactly? I'm looking for a solution that would allow me to play my PC games on my TV. (The PC and the TV are in seperate rooms and it's a pain to move the PC from the office each time I want to play.) I'd also prefer...
It has been 1 year since your question, but I felt it necessary to post that Scott Beeson, the previous poster to answer your question, is wrong. The NVIDIA Shield is designed to do exactly what you described.
While console mode is enabled, is it obligatory to have the shield in clamshell mode?
No. You need the screen up even if you aren't going to use it (HDMI-Out Only) as when the clamshell is closed it covers up the buttons on the top.
Is it worth it even IF I cannot use the streaming feature?
Yes, its still worth it, its still I awesome piece of hardware. I personally dont really use the game streaming feature a lot, but I love the attention it gets me in public. People are always like wow what are you playing on.
storage capacity?

Does this PS3 have a disc drive to play game discs?
If you're asking if it comes with a DVD player to play the PS3 games you can buy at your local store (as well as DVDs and Blu-rays), yes. If you're asking if it comes with a hard disk drive, no it doesn't. You can purchase a hard disk drive for it, along with a frame that holds the drive and allows you to screw it into the console, which is what I did. If you don't buy a hard disk drive, it is limited to 12 GB of internal memory, which won't let you play more than one or two games at a time.
Does this 12 GB system play ps2 games?
Only the first generation PS3 consoles can play PS2 games.
ps3 hdd
It has no hdd. The 12 gb is internal memory. You can install your own hdd as long as it's 2.5''. You also need a mounting kit so your hdd will fit properly
Does this 12 gb play fifa 2015 or I should get an external hard disc?
I do not know the space requirements for that game, but you can look at the back of the game case or google your question. Either way you will use up that 12gb really fast with system updates, game updates, and save files so i would still invest in a internal hard drive. Not an external hard drive as you cannot play your games off of the external.
What comes with the PS3? Cords? Controllers? Or just console only?
Power cord, S-video cable and usb charge cable for the controller. No HDMI cable though :(
does the controller come with the usb charging cable?
The PS unit does, but to buy an individual controller at a store or online, no.
Can older model wireless controls for PlayStation be used on a PlayStation 3
Only older model PS3 controllers
It is said to be region free. Will it play a Pal BluRay disc?
I assume you're talking blu ray movies. Play them? probably, display them correctly? I mean the ones encoded at 25fps that aren't region lock, I don't think so but I've never tried them myself. For Region B locked Blu rays no unless the console is the pal version. Region Free I'm pretty sure means for games only, there is one game I know of that is an exception to this rule: Persona 4 Arena. In short no it will not play Pal encoded Blu Rays nor display them correctly.
does it come with wireless controlars
It comes with one wireless controller
How many wired controllers can I hook up to this? And how many total (wired+wireless)? Trying to see how I can have 4 players if possible.
On all the ps3s there are only 2 USB ports, but you can plug in a 4 port USB hub and have all 4-5 controller's working. Actually the ps3 supports up to 8 players but good luck finding a game that will support 8 lol Wireless is up to 8 controller's also, you can of course combine wire and wireless.
I ordered this item and does not fit my iphone 5? Am I missing something?If not I would like to return.

The key is a headphone wrap and the fish is a cord wrap.
1) How long does it take to fully charge this on the computer? 2) How long does it then take to fully charge an iphone?

How do u guys apply to iPhone 5? It is a micro USB port!
You would use your iphone 5 usb cable

You can use both ports ... I have had 2 phones charging before at the same time
Assuming I have the correct USB to lightning cable, will it work with an iPhone 6?
Yes.. works with anything that has a USB cord.
will this charge a iphone4?
My iPhone 4s works fine with it, and I think it should work with an iPhone 4.
Can you charge a tablet with the 3000 vs. the 6000?
I havent charched a tablet with the Lepow series 3000mAh. It perfectly works with my cell phone.
Anyone use this with an LG and what if any pros and cons?
We'll I don't own a LG phone anymore I can imagine it would work just fine if it uses a micro USB port.

Does the scroll wheel have an indented clicky feel when you spin it? I want it to be able to precisely switch fps weapons.
It isn't free-spin, and it does have tactile feedback of the scrolling. It's not as pronounced as some mice that have more of a ratcheting feel to them, but it should be fine for fps gaming. I use it that way myself.
does it come with a manal?
Yes, A very good manal.
Is there a slot in the battery compartment to store the USB nano-receiver when on the road, as with other Logitech gaming mice?
Yes there is. Underneath the battery cover there's a place specifically to securely store the USB dongle.
Does the usb receiver work with logitech keyboards? E.g., I am looking at a LT K750 and wondering whether either receiver will work for both devices.
No, it's a unique receiver that's not compatible with other Logitech products. The K750 uses the Logitech unifying receiver which is compatible with a range of Logitech products that supports unifying, but there are no Logitech gaming mice that support unifying receivers currently. Net, you'll need to use both receivers with that keyboard and mouse combination.
I also just seen that there is another listing you have for this mouse for a few dolars less. What is the difference?
The Price.
i have M.S.and my fingers are weak, The 2 buttons on top left,are they easy to push,like the left click button,and do they push from side or top.
Yes they are very easy to push down and all buttons can be pushed pushed from just about any angle this also includes the thumb buttons. Up down left right but thumbs requires more push as it would interfere with pressing them if it were any easier you would get miss press's.
Are the side buttons mechanically clicky (omron/similar) or mushy (rubber mat)?
If I understand your question, they're mechanically clicky (you hear a 'click' sound).
does it work on glass?
Nope. I have a glass desk and bought this and still have to use a mouse pad. It's a great mouse and I still like it, but it does not work on glass.
Does this mouse support a press and hold DPI change for sniping?
Yes, it supports this function. Through the Logitech Gaming Software, you can assign any button of the mouse to "Shift DPI" function. You choose the button and the DPI you want. As long as you press the selected button, the mouse operates to the specified DPI.
Is the scroll wheel free-spinning, has click stops, or switchable (like the MX Revolution)?
The scroll will is click stop but very smooth , new experience from logitech. You can't control it like the MX
Can i have a list of all the mods in the order of when you press the button on the back
We bought ours from Premium Controllerz. They send us a detailed email with all instructions. Sure they would you as well. Just ask through Amazon.
will this work for call of duty ghost
yes
How fast is rapid fire
It is decent. A friend of mine has a faster trigger finger. But it's still good for people who don't have a tringer finger
Can you use a microphone with this controller?
Yes you can.
does it work for all games?
Not every game but most cod games it does
will this work on gotham city impostors?
Yes
does it have rapid fire for the ballista and dsr 50 from black ops 2
Those are bolt action snipers. So it wouldn't work at all. And mods don't work well on BO2 anyways
Does this product work for any call of duty specificly for MW3?
Yes it is amazing for every game easy to use
Is this compatible with Sniper Elite 3 - Online Multiplayer?
The controller itself will work, but the modded portion will probably not work due to the game being in 3rd person.
does it work on gta 5
Yes
how is this mouse compared to the mazer 1 type r? better? worse? improvements?
Improvement, especially on the looking
Will this work on ubuntu?
As long you use a computer with a USB port, and mouse compatable then yes.
is this item wired or wireless?
It is wired. Braided cable btw
How loud does the mouse click? Reviews say that they got wireless mouses instead, I will most definitely receive a wired mouse, correct?
It sounds normal like any other mouse clicks and you will get a wired mouse no doubt. It works very well.
How is the packaging? does it come in the original box and would it look presentable as a gift?
Yes comes in original box.
Does anyone know if this will work with Windows 8?
This works perfectly windows 8
Is there any way to turn the lights off? The lights stay on, even when my computer is off.
The lights turn off when you shut your computer off completely. Putting your pc on sleep does not turn off the lights.
are there any programmable buttons/does it come w/ a drive program?
No,there aren't,this mouse is plug and play
What is the weight like, compared to the Mazer Type R?
Can't really compare this to the type R as I don't have it. It's a solid mouse for the money though. What I can tell you as far as weight is concerned is that it's seems slightly back heavy (perhaps because of the "balance ring" which is the thumb catch towards the back), but for the most part pretty well balanced. My only real complaint is that I wish they would've elongated the "balance ring (thumb catch)" a little more. I find myself sometimes sort of running over my thumb with this. But for the money, I would recommend it!
Wired or Wireless? (one star reviews say they recieved wireless instead of the wired version)
You can get it in both. Just double check which one your ordering.
Any download codes included with this game or is the entire experience in the cartridge?
Hey, lopez. The game is the cartridge only thing you can do online wise is check out other player scores on a scoreboard.
What is the sexual content in this game?
There is a very brief scene in the game where you see a woman button her shirt and a man zip up his pants in an attempt to imply that she was trading sexual favors for medical supplies. There is no nudity.
If I buy this game I need to buy the chapters also or no
no it already comes with all the chapters of season one plus the 400 Days DLC(special episode)
How does it look on PS VIta slim?
it looks great! runs smooth just like the console. Ive seen some pretty bad vita ports. (god of war collection and sly cooper: thives in time) but this game and PLaystation all stars are amazing on the vita.
there's no cross-PLAY on this right? Saving the game on PS3 and continiuing on Vita... i already have this on PS3.
Unfortunately, no. I wish there was though. I would have liked to use my ps3 season 1 save to continue season 2 on my Vita.
Would any one recommend or strongly object to the idea of a 12.5 year old boy playing this game if he says he, " I can handle it."
Its not that bad of a game i mean its not like he is asking for dead space on a playstation 3. However you are doing a great job at parenting seeking help first before buying him a game. I think it is rated mature. I would say let him play it 12-16yr olds i think should handle it just as well as a 17yr old. Ive played mature games since i was a young kid and theres nothing wrong with zombie games for a 12 yr old. If youre a really cautious parent though then no he would need to wait a few more yesrs
does wii products play on Wii U too?
Yes it also plays on the Wii U. Played it this morning. :)
Does this work on wii mini?
Yes
Can you use this game on a euopean wii player? Is it multi 5?
zumba kids states it is for use only in the USA, Canada, Mexico, and Latin America. I did not see any marking to indicate it is a multi 5. I hope that helps.
We would like to have a group of kids use this. Can this work?
I think there are a max of 4 score keeping slots at any one time, I have done it with 3 kids at once. But if you have enough room to move about it is the movement that is fun not the score keeping, So if they like "dance" it is fun to move along with out keeping score, and it is a work out, so taking turns or in other words resting, is certainly an option and there are enough slots to keep track of everyone's score.
can we watch this on a DVD player?
No, you need to play it on Nintendo Wii with controller. The game checks to see how much the controller movement matches up with the movement on the screen to award points.
Does this also play on a wii mini?
Yes, it plays in the Wii mini.
Do you need the Zumba fitness belt for Wii to use this?
No. Not at all.

Do all the games have Steam keys?
Only Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim have Steam keys. Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind (inc. DLC) and Oblivion (inc. DLC) can be installed via CD/DVD without the need the need for Steam, Skyrim however requires Steam activation before you can play, even if you install via DVD. (It should be noted that Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim plus all DLC are on ONE Steam key.)
Does it include "Oblivion Game of the Year Edition" or "Oblivion Game of the Year Edition Deluxe"? Deluxe has extra DLCs beyond the two listed.
Bethesda answers this here : http://www.bethblog.com/2013/08/07/the-complete-elder-scrolls-collection-comes-to-pc-this-september/ "For Oblivion, this means that the **disc** version of the game does not include the smaller add-ons (Horse Armor, Fighter's Stronghold, Mehrunes' Razor, etc)... more on that below." "As a bonus, the included Steam key will activate Steam versions of Morrowind GOTY and Oblivion GOTY Deluxe. Like the disc release of Oblivion, the deluxe versions include the main game, Knights of the Nine, and Shivering Isles, but it also adds English versions of the Wizard's Tower, Fighter's Stronghold, Orrery, Thives' Den, The Vile Lair, Mehrunes' Razor, and Horse Armor. These add-ons are not compatible with the disc version of the game, so you will need to use the Steam version to access them."
Does it works in w8.1?
Yes, I have 8.1 as well and all the games run fine.
Do I have to download &amp; install Steam or just create an account? Will the Steam Code be auto asked for after installing it?
You only need to download steam for skyrim i believe and once its downloaded it should ask for skyrims activation code
How big are the map posters that are included in this set?
Just over 16" x 20"
i already downloaded the base game of Skyrim off steam. will your disk allow me to have all the expansions added to my existing game? or a new game?
Hey Ashlan you can still play your game it downloads everything and will continue with your game. You will not lose anything. I hope that helps.
what if you already have skyrim on the pc with dlcs will it transfer data over? Cause conflicting files? Accept workshop mods?
why not just not install skyrim? they come on separate discs
Can you play the Anthology on MAC?
Sadly no. Its a PC only.
Will all the games work under Windows 7 and the XBox controller? I can't handle a mouse for hours anymore.
These are all windows games, so they will work on 7. (If you you have a non/ low gaming pc run skyrim in low) Skyrim, and Oblivion have it opted in to using a xbox 360 controller, morrowind might have a mod out to do the same. As for Arena and Daggerfall, you only really need the keyboard, as the mouse is optional, these games simply can't be played with a controller.
Are any of the physical manuals included?
Sadly, no. You can find digital copies in .pdf format at manuals.bethsoft.com, however.
Does this come with multi-voltage support?
Yes Halim S. I have used it in two separate countries since I bought it. Currently, I am in a country with electricity rating 220 Volts, alternating at 50 cycles per second. That means this device does accept 220 Volts at 50 Hertz, and you do not need a voltage converter. It has multi-voltage support, just like the PS4. It is definitely "plug and play" anywhere in the world. Enjoy your purchase.
What happens if i leave the dualshock 4 on the charging station while it is plugged it even when the battery of the dualshock 4 is fully charged
I've had these charging stations on the PS3, and according to Energizer when the controls are already charged, the LED lights are on, but stop charging the batteries. And it really works, because I had four controls, and they worked perfectly until sells them.
I have a charging station for PS3; will it work for PS4 controllers?
No, the USB is different. Mini vs Micro USB.
Is the AC Adapter compatible with wall outlets in North America?
Yes. I live in North America and the charger works fine.
it is only 110v or 220v also ?
The adapter works on both currents.
Does this plug into the wall?
Yes, it does.
will this work with a controller that has a silicone skin around it?
Yes it will as long as the silicone isn't too thick.
Is the version that lights up blue when charged the version you are selling?
Yes
I wonder how long it takes to load this device is the most important for me and it takes 2 hours to charge your control on playstation ps4 the idea
I bought this device in order to avoid let on mY PS4 more time than I expected. This charger for me is very usefull, becasue let you charge two controllers at the same time. However, if you have just one controller, maybe it is not a good idea.and about the time, for me is very fast.
do the lights turn off when no controller is attached, or are they constantly on when the unit is plugged into the wall?
The lights are off when there is no controller attached
Is this compatible with Infinity 2.0 as well?
All 1.0 characters are playable on 2.0, but playsets are not compatible so you can only use the characters in ToyBox mode.
What machine does this play on?
Characters work on any platform. Infinity bases are platform specific. Example: If you purchase Infinity for Wii and decide that you want to move to an XBox360, you will have to buy Infinity for XBox360 but you WILL NOT have to repurchase your characters.
will it work with play station 3?
Yes
What is the difference between getting the Elsa and Anna characters separately versus getting the Frozen Toy Box Pack? Sorry I am a bit confused.
The figurines are sold alone. The packs are sold with two characters and two power discs. The play sets are sold with two characters and their own "world" to play in.
Will Elsa play on the Disney Infinity 2.0 Marvel Heroes starter pack?
Yes, all the infinity characters are designed to cohesively work together. It is kind of neat to see a Marvel character and Elsa cohabitate the game, she has similar powers to Iceman from the X-men
if u brought this from the USA would it work over here in New zealand?
Yes, as I live in Australia. I have brought the item and it works here.
is this for 2.0
Its for 1.0 but can be used on the 2.0 in the toybox
Does Elsa come with the disk?
Yes
Good morning all the figures work for any console Disney Infinity ie all figures work for 3DS
Yes
Will wii 2.0 play on regular Wii, if buy Wiiu infinity? Need to know ASAP, sorry, bought wrong
No it does not play on the original Wii. To play Infinity 2.0 characters you need to change to a X Box 1 or a Playstation 4 or the Wii universe (or whatever the latest model is called).

- Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Yes, it most definitely does have two player mode or single player.
What is the age range on this? Would it be appropriate for a 6 yr old?
The ESRB rating is E for everyon 10+, however this is a family friendly game. If you 6 year old watched the movie I don't see any problems with them playing this. As with all of the Lego games you have to smash objects and enemies, but it isn't a violent game. If you have any concerns download the free demo and play for a few. Great game if you are a fan of the film.
Will this play on the Kinect?
I don't think it will play through the Kinect. I read the game manual insert and the entire case and the Kinect wasn't mentioned. I have the 360 version, so if you have the Xbox 1 it may have added features, however I don't know. I played the entire game without seeing any mention of it. I hope this helped answer your question.
Hi there dose this come in a case with the dic or is it emailed to you to download on the xbox 360 thanks
It comes with a case with the disc in it.
How do you save the levels? My daughter is so frustrated because she has to keep starting over each time she plays. Thanks.
The game should auto-save as you are playing provided there is a hdd on the 360.
is there a free play mode
Yes there is you must complete the game first to unlock it.
Does this game have a "free-roaming" area like New York City in LEGO Marvel?
Not really,........... my wife and I had to stop playing it, because is was too "busy"... The game itself is fairly self directed. In other words, not free-roaming.
does this game have access to all the characters?
Yes, you can earn all the characters from the movie. Similar to how you earn characters in other Lego games.
does this game have access to all the characters?
After you unlock them via secret code or via playing a story mode
does this game have access to all the characters?
Ahsen you unlock characters as you play an complete missions! Also money collected can unlock characters.

How does the game look on the Wii U compared to the PS4? I have both systems and am having a hard time deciding which to get
There is a very little noticeable difference, but the game is more interesting to play on the wii u. And also you hace the option to use the game pad as a standalone console.
is it compatible with the wii
Wii u games cannot be used on the wii but wii games can be played on the wii u
is this a 2 players simultaneous game?
Yes very fun as well
this game include spanish language????
I asked my son this, and he said he does not know. He has never seen the option for it. Sorry!
Can this game be played with both a Wiimote and nunchuk?
Yes
Do any of the Lego Games have a Sandbox mode? I would love to find a Lego game with a Sandbox just to play around making things..
Lego Indiana jones 2
can the lego movie game be used for the older Wii? not Wii u...
no,this game is only for the Wii U,all new games are now for Wii U
Does it have an explorable world? Can you be Wyldstyle?
Yes and yes. It follows the formula of the other Lego video games, but I personally prefer this one among the rest. :P
Is it possible to save played game in middle and start next time at same point? If yes, how?
No you can't
Does it have an open, explorable world?
Yep

If I bought this and bought a xbox one later, can it be transferred later? I had read somewhere that it was possible.
http://www.callofduty.com/ghosts/dlc/season-pass The season pass should follow you for free if you bought it before May 31, 2014, but I don't believe the game is available for a free upgrade anymore.
Is the actual game included in this pack?
yes it's included with the other goodies...
is this worth the price
I think it was worth it because the original price was $200 and I got it for half of that but the game itslef isn't that great
Will the camera run off of USB power when the battery is 100% drained? Like how a PS3 controller will?
Yes but it is bad for the battery
Anybody figure out how to mount the camera to a helmet or anything else?
This camera contain diferent bases for mount in helmet, or bike, or in the head, this camera it's great
Does this include a code to download the ghost camo? Thanks
yes it should be in with the game case
Is the camera waterproof?
No it isn't sadly
does the camera come with batteries
Yes
does the camera come with batteries
Yes
does it come with dlcs and a manual
Yes
im new to gaming and found this for 73.99 is it worth it?
Go for it man but make sure to check for the satisfaction percentage of the place that is selling it and where they are located
Is the camera for the game or can you use it for anything?
Anything. It also can be mounted on a bike or on the dash of a car.
Can anyone tell me what features the 1080p HD Tactical Camera has. Is it worth it?
Well the camera itself looks really badass and the quality is very good. It came with a 4gb micro sd but switched it for an 8. Also if you go airsofting you can attack the camera to your airsoft gun. I say its worth it, because a game cost $60 and thats how much your paying and the camera is basically free, which is very awesome. If it was original price I wouldn't get it but since its very low price its definitely worth buying.
does the prestige package it include the game itself
Yes
i wonder if the season pass got expired and other DLC ?
Not it dosen't
im new to gaming and found this for 73.99 is it worth it?
Yes it is. The game alone cost about $50.this set also includes a tactical recorder. To capture all your online or off line play. It usually sells by itself for about $70-$100. So its a great bargain to get the game, expansion maps, recorder and a few more bonuses. Good buy. U recommend it.
Can you charge the battery and a phone simultaneously by connecting them in series?
No. Our Astro 2nd Gen batteries cannot be charged and discharged at the same time for protection of the battery.
should I get this or the anker astro 9000 2nd gen. all I want it to do is recharge my device at school or on the go. I have a samsung s2. 2-3 charges
The 6000 is capable of 2 full plus a half charges for my phone. It seems that 2500 is needed for for a full charge so figure that the 9000 is good for 3 charges and change. Choosing between the 6000 or the 9000 depends on how many times you need to charge for a given time away from an outlet. Also size and weight is something to consider.
Will it fit and charge at old AT&amp;T flip phone?
Yes
Do you HAVE to shake it to start the charge or will it start charging your phone as soon as you plug the cables in?
It will start as soon as you plug it in.
How long does one charge last without charging it again? I guess if I leave on standby, how long will the charge last?
If you are asking how long your PHONE or other item will stay charged, after charging....then I charged my phone in the AM at camp, and didn't use it much and it still had prob 40% or so when I went to bed. So a normal day's charge for me. The device itself, I've been home 2 weeks, and it still had 1/2 the usage bar full when my husband borrowed it this morning.
what is the size of the unit? length and width?
3.7 x 1.8 x 1 inches
When used to charge an Android (Nexus 5, in particular), does it show up as "Charging (AC)" or "Charging (USB)" in the Battery menu?
I only used it to charge a HTC 1S. It showed up as USB charging.
How many times will it charge my Galaxy S4?
My Galaxy S3 charge about 1 and a half times
I don't want to charge off a PC, can I charge the Anker off the AC wall charger &amp; cable that came with the iPhone or do I need an extra cable?
Well to charge the Anker it comes w/ a wire to charge w computer but you can plug the USB side to you iphone plug. And to charge your iphone use your iphone wire
How do you recharge
You can use the same charger you use for your phone or tab. You could also use the computer usb port but it takes much longer. If you want rapid charging you could also buy a rapid charger.
does it still have bugs now
Not nearly as many bugs, but yes it still has issues (for example, graphics and audio loading issues when a multiplayer round is started). Still fun to play.
I have a xbox 360 4GB will that hard drive be big enough to play this game??
You will need a larger Hard Drive. The game is quite large and if you intend to play online, you will need more space for the online content, patches, and map packs. I would suggest that you upgrade your hard drive and move your data to the new drive and work from there.
How do you get the Premium for Battlefield 4? Can you purchase the code on Live?
Yes you can purchase premium through the game main menu it will say store click that and it will bring you to abunch of options you can buy including premium....
Can I use a memory unit
If you are referring to the harddrive on the Xbox or the an extra external drive you may purchased than yes. Thats how you save your game progress
Does this come with the China Rising pack?
No you have to purchase it from the store online............
which in your opinion is better battlefield 4 or destiny
Battlefield 4, although BF3 &gt; BF4 Destiny seems pretty good but it couldn't get me hooked like BF4 did.
Can you turn off the lights in a building so enemy's cant see anything?
No I don't think so. But there are switches that can stop vehicles from entering a certain area. You can also have a flashlight on your gun which can blond enemy's. This feature can be toggle on or off. Hope this help
I still can't load on my xbox 360. It says I need an HD AV connector to load it. Is this correct. Some other games I have are HD &amp; loaded &amp; play fine.
You need a HDMI cable thst plugs from your 360 to your flat screen tv if It keeps on saying that then you need to just turn your xbox360 off and then back on or just restart the whole console if you need any other help please feel free to email me at allyboy94@yahoo.com
The set comes in Spanish version and you can play offline coop
Thanks for the message.....this is the us version of the game.
what exactly is the difference between a campaign and a regular video game?
Campaign is "single player" mode playing set missions against the computer. You can get online and play a campaign with other people on your team as well. Most people get online and play multi-player matches where everyone is a real person on both teams.
If i buy a used game can i still play online or does it have to be a brand new game. If i need to buy a code how much does that cost? thank you
You do not need to buy an online pass to play a used copy of Battlefield 4 online. EA didn't put it in since it caused trouble with Battlefield 3.
Im planning to purchase this game CD in US amazon store, will it work on an asian console? i also have an american account BTW
I am not 100% positive, but I am pretty sure it will work on any PS3 console.
This game is in language or subtitles in Spanish?
Mine is in English im not sure if you can change the language on it
is multilanguage? Spanish?
As far as I know mulit language support for Battlefield 4 includes English, Spanish, French and Brazilian Portuguese... So yes it includes Spanish hope that helps you out.
if I buy this game via amazon and my account is from mexico , will it work o its going to display an error ?
I bought one copy and i worked on my ps3, Im in Colombia. Im sure it would work in Mxico.
Ok, does the ps3 version upgradable to ps4 version or not?
When I first purchased my ps3 version, it had a $10 coupon for the ps4 version but there was no automatic upgrades and another purchase was required.
does the ps3 version comes with free dlc?
My son said no it doesn't; you have to buy it.
does the bf4 game box still have the $10 code for ps4 in the box in october 2014?
Yes it does but I'm not sure when it expires
Greetings, I bought this game with you, but I want to know if it brings the Spanish language?
no. it is in English. you could try to contact EA support (easupport.com) or go to battlelog.battlefield.com forums to find out information if a language package might be included in a future patch. gg
Can anyone tell me how far the microphone extends? On the Siberia V2 it's 5" (measuring from the bottom side), which is not long enough to work well.
It is 5 inches from the microphone extension outlet. In reality, it is about 4 1/2 inches (or less) depending on how you bend or shape it. That is not really long enough and I have volume issues since purchasing these to the point where I'd just be better off with a secondary mic.
Can one headphone be removed to leave one ear open while using the headphones?
Yes, the right-side headphone can be removed.
I Realize it only says pc and mac, but has anyone tried these who has linux?
Its standard 3.5mm connections. Shouldn't be a problem (no drivers)
Do the headphones have to plug into a usb port? or can the also plug into an iPhone? ps i don't know why we are called disappointed on here!
it should come with an extra cord that lets you attach it to your iphone. its a string that has a input, and the chord to ur headset is inserted in this attachment. i recently used it to use it as a PS4 mic. so it is possible if you have that cord attachment
Any way to change out the stock pads for some velour ones? These get my ear kinda hot.
They are stitched on, so not sure that you can change them, but might be able to get covers over them.
Do these work with an XBOX 360?
Hi. No these do not work with the XBOX 306 just for Macs, PC's, tablets and phones. I hope this helps.
The "Synapse 2.0" feature implys that keypad won't work if my Internet is down. Is this true?
It works fine w/o internet. When it's connected to the internet, it simply gives you access to your profiles / settings that you have saved in their cloud. If you don't have access to the internet, it will just use the local copy of the settings you have. It's nice because if you go to someone else's house or use a different computer, you'll have your custom settings right there for you.
Can you change the colors of the backlighting to red?
No - you can only change the intensity or turn it off all together, but you can't change the color.
is this better than the (Logitech G13 Programmable Gameboard with LCD Display)?
I wouldn't say better...just different. I've used both now and the G13 has an awkward analog stick instead of the D-Pad. They're entirely two different devices as far as I'm concerned. Try them both and decide for yourself.
Does the Tartarus gamepad have the glue issue horror stories on the palm rest that I've heard about the Orbweaver?
I haven't had any issues
Does this work well under Windows 8.1?
Yes I am currently running it on Windows 8.1
How does this compare to the discontinued Belkin Nostromo N52TE? Is the fit better, worse, the same? Is there a thumb button below the joypad?
The fit is almost exactly the same. The palm rest comes a little further out for large hands that. They removed the wheel and gave you a button, which matches up with most games giving you 12 action buttons and then you still have room for Shift/Ctrl/Alt on the pinky side. The buttons feel the same as the TE, they aren't mechanical like the Orbweaver, but they are responsive. Yes there still is a thumb button above the "hat" joystick and a thumb paddle button below it (hard to see in pictures). It seems that Razer also improved the software somewhat over the N52TE with one exception - we lost the "repeat until another button it pressed" macro action. So you have to toggle on/off macros now. Maybe they will fix that in a future release.
For those of you that have bigger hands, does this "fit" well? I have bigger hands and its hard to find peripherals that "fit" comfortably.
I'm 6'4" (1.93 m) with fairly large hands and it fits great.
I am purchasing equipment for an Oculus Rift that will be released next year. Does this work well for first person games? I know only WASD.
Yes James it should do you good there
will my pc still need a reg keyboard for basic typing outside of video games? would a wired keyboard/mouse be better than wireless?
Yes and absolutely yes. this keypad barely has enough buttons for the whole alphabet, let alone an entire keyboard. By no means trash a keyboard for this, it's purely meant for a more ergonomic input method. As for the wired/wireless, there are tradeoffs. Personally wired is more reliable, no battery to worry about and no wonky connection issues to deal with. But if you can't configure it to be somewhere comfortable for you within the reach of the wire, that's what wireless is for. Be advised that any wireless device will have at least a tiny bit of lagged input to the computer, so it's not advised for anything competitive.
Will this work on my Alienware alpha? can I use it for elder scrolls online? Will I need a separate mouse? I hear it crashes, is it a easy fix?
I'm not sure if it is good for the game in question but I love this thing. Never crashed one time on me.
Can these be used on Xbox? I can't see what kind of connection it uses to attach to the controller/system
This headset can connect to an Xbox One controller through the (optional purchase) Stereo Headset Adapter from Microsoft.
How long is the cable?
about 4 feet.
Can you hear game sound through this headset, or do I still have to have my TV volume turned up?
You need the TV volume. This is a chat headset.
can you really hear surround sound with only one ear covered any problems with this headset ???
Yes you can still hear sound (from your home surround sound system), they are vented so that they are not sealing out the outside sound. These are just for voice, work well
Does this plug into the system? or does it plug into the controller?
It plugs into controller .
does it work whit ps3
I dont know for sure, but I doubt it. Also, the one I bought is unusable because the sound is so low I cant even hear what anyone is saying if the is any noise at all in the room, like a fan, an open window, the game sounds or music. My advice is go to Game Stop and get a full headset meant for PS3.
Can I wear this on my right ear and have the mic boom extend to my mouth (because extending to the back of my neck isn't going to do me any good)?
Yes. The mic is reversible and will go either direction.
Can this work on ps3
I personally don't own a PS3, but my friend uses it for hers.
How come I just bought this headset and it does not work on my PS4?
You need to enable it within settings under devices I believe. Look through PS4 settings menu. You may need to reboot PS4 afterwards too. Set it to output to headset.
Are these able to be connected to a PC with microphone and speaker functions?
You are able to get dolby digital audio through the spidif, if you use the bluetooth as comunication device on your computer you will be able to use speaker and microphone on your headsets as mean of comunication. The spidif it self does not support the microphone audio to be send. I have been using the blutooth for skype calls and online gaming and it works. Hope this helps.
just got this headset and so far I love it but I can't turn chat volume down. As soon as I go into the party the voices are really loud
I would check the PS4 settings for chat volume. The headset has chat control on the right side of the headphone. Hope that helps
I have this headset, how can I remove the mic? I tried pulling it out with some force but nothing is unplugging it. How can I do this?
Pull on the middle of the cord, not on the base attached to the headset.
Can you let ME know what kind of (Headset) I have by this Information here:**Model:TB300 3276-01(?) ;**FCC ID:X4B-TB2278(?) ;**S/N:G3276D3702106(?)
It's the Turtle Beach PX4. If it's wireless that will confirm it. Also if you have the accessories of the PX4
Is this headset surround sound for both PS3 and PS4? I would like a headset that has equal surround sound for both systems?
Yes the headset is compatible with PS3 as well as ps4...awesome headset. I purchased the headset when the ps4 first came out on day 1 and a year and half later it's still running like a champ.
Can you use the headset with the PS4 and PC simultaneously?
NO
Does px4 work with PS vita
I would assume so. It has an audiojack cord, and I've used it in a pinch for my ipod and pc. I don't own a vita, so I don't know what size jack it has.
When you connect the Headset to your PS4 controller in order for chat to work, is the in-game sound still 5.1 Surround Sound or not anymore?
Yes. It has a feature to automatically adjust chat volume according to the sound signal, ie what's going on in the game. So if youre in a loud cinematic in game moment, the chat will also j crease in volume. I turn the sound down most of the time unless I'm gaming alone. I personally I don't like the feature because it sounds like people are uelling in your ear when the music gets loud
Is it possible to listen to music or videos on a laptop using Bluetooth connection only?
Yes you can. You will need to sync the headphones to the laptop. It will work as long as your laptop has blue tooth capabilities. You can find out by going to the master volume control on the laptop's control panel. Hope this helps.

does this come with all the accessories from the original packaging? mainly the items for it to function like the Mixamp and such?
Yes, it will come with everything you need to open the box, set it up and start playing. If anything is missing or if something is not working, let us know right away and we'll help you out. You get the same one year limited warranty and the same 30 day return period as all other ASTRO products.
Does it still come in the normal package with instructions, casing and all?
Yes, it comes with everything and is packaged like it was new.
will these work on the xbox one as well
Yes
I like to use Skype on my computer while using a headset to hear the TV if I am gaming on a console. Is there a way to hear both anyone is aware of?
So, I deleted my earlier post. Getting 2 audio sources to play simultaneously is actually pretty easy. The mixamp has a line in for spdif (optical) and your typical aux 3.5mm jack. I hooked my computer via spdif and my TV via aux. You'll get both AND be able to toggle the balance with the right earcup game/VoIP switch. (I initially thought it didn't work, as I was 100% to my computer source, hence my deleted answer. Don't make my mistake). I would recommend the spdif from your console and aux from your computer, you'll get better in game sound. The balance feature is really nice, and it is tailored to your exact needs.
Are these updated to the latest firmware before being shipped?
Yes they are.
Does it come in original packaging?
Yes
For use with Xbox One, how do you connect the 2.5mm chat cable from the new xbox headset adapter? Do you need to run the 2.5mm cable to the mix amp?
No, the chat cable runs directly into the headset from the controller.
Will these work on the Playstation 4 console?
Yes all ASTRO products will work with the next generation PS4. It uses the same technology that the PS3 used so there are no additional products you need. Sony will be releasing a firmware update though after release that will be required for the chat to work. No details have yet been released about this update. Regards, ASTRO Gaming
Is there anything else I need to buy to go with these for them to work on the ps4?
No there is no other accessories you need. When you get your new Astro's just plug them into your PC and download the lastest firmware for them and you are good to go. The PS4 does accept this device and never had a issue.
I have plugged in the cord from the headset to the controller, and while the mic icon is on the mic is not working. Any hints?
I had problems with my mic on Windows 7. Works fine on Windows 8. There could be a ton of reasons though. You need it set as default in your sound setting and typically selected in the program you are using too. Also, if the mic boom is straight up, it turns the mic off.
Does this come as a single CD key for both, or one for each?
A key for each.
Does it come with all the DLCs for both origins and 2?
All dlc for origins, base game only for da2. Note that to properly authorize dlc for origins, latest patch must be downloaded.
do you have to use origin or can you use steam to paly the game
The key is for origin
will this play on windows 8
Yup... Works on Windows 8.

what's different between standard and Stealth Edition
The stealth edition does not have the distinct "click" with every keystroke. It will sound more like your traditional keyboard when you press the key.
is it mechanical
yes.
Is the one for sale here the Razer Blackwidow 2014 Stealth Edition Expert Mechanical, is this the new one with mechanical switches?
This does have mechanical switches. In past years, Razer used Cherry switches. However, in this and other current models, Razer is using their own mechanical switches. Unclear if they outsourced the design and manufacture of these new switches.
What color are the backlit keys on this keyboard?
They are just Green . Chroma version has unlimited colors!
does anyone know if this keyboard's keys are laser etched as well? or is it just the blackwidow ultimate?
Just the ultimate.
Any big difference Gaming wise between the backlit version and the standard version? And about the keys, the stealth or the clicky one?
The only difference between the backlit and the standard is well backlit! And the difference between the stelth and the greens are the stealth isint clicky
does the standard stealth use cherry mx brown or razer orange?
The new razer keyboards have razer switches so the standard has the razer greens and the stealth uses the razer orange
Does the standard stealth version have a usb port and an audio jack?
Yes, on the right hand side of keyboard there are a USB port, a headphone jack and a microphone jack.
Should I get the standard or ultimate? FYI: I don't care about the backlit leds.
The side USB and headphone/microphone jacks are ever so helpful(to me), and the key-caps are the slightest bit different ...Aside from that (and the back lighting), they are the exact same keyboard.
Are these keyboards the latest version (2014) of Blackwidows or are they the old versions?
I don't know if these are the latest versions, but these only have one color, which is green. If you want the ones that do change color, you're probably looking for the Chroma Blackwidows.
Does it require Xbox live?
Yes Yes Yes and YES!!
Can you play with another person on a split screen on Xbox 360?
No, you cannot. You can play split screen with others on Xbox Live, but not with the person sitting next to you on your own couch. How annoying is that?!
i have xbox gold live but still cant log on to play garden war fare
For 360, you have to sign in under the person that has the gold membership, go to settings, accounts, memberships, and make sure your gold membership is applied. Whoever plays will have to play on that persons login. From what I have read online, for the xbox 360, each person has to have their own gold membership in order to play under their own login...which doesn't make sense because you have to be 13 to get a gold membership, yet the game is rated for 10+ and you can't play without gold.
can I play offline
No
do you only need xbox live in order to play this game or both xbox live and xbox live gold? I don't know the difference
You need an Xbox live gold subscription.... Xbox live gold is a paid subscription that Xbox users have to buy in order to play online games. Without a gold subscription you can only buy services and games from Microsoft but you cannot play online, since this game only has online multiplayer and no single player campaign you can't use it without the paid subscription.
When will the next update in plants vs zombies 2 arrive
The developers don't tell the players
Can a parent limit online interaction with the PS4 version of this game, or is all game play done against online competitors?
It is xbox live players only
does xbox one require a gold membership or does ps3or 4 requiree any membership or play on split screen?
I think acess too certain games in xbox one requires the same gold membership extra money per player as 360. play station does not require additional payment no matter what version and all games like Minecraft and plants vs zombies are ps just like xbox. only xbox seems to want to charge extra
I just want to be able to play on the same maps at the same time. So XBOX and PC versions are on different servers?
They are on different servers
What is the xbox gold live membership?
it is a monthly membership. if you don't have it - you cannot play the game... AT ALL! would have been nice to know that before we bought it.
Does it require Xbox live?
Yes Yes Yes and YES!!

What kind of game is this? Is it just for kids? I'm a 37 year-old male?
It's actually quite fun regardless of age. I would even bet most of the players are older! I wouldn't judge it based in its wonky and cartoonish presentation. It's rather very competitive, deep, and balanced, and a lot of fun actually. I found me and my friends got hooked on it for months. IMO it's the best xbox one game to date. Looks great, plays great and it fun what more could you want It's has a third person view, also a zombie or plant master mode where you kind of micromanage as well. Has character cards to unlock abilities and customization for classes. A survival wave mode, team death match, and a domination style mode. All of them are very fun. Every class requires a certain strategy to succeed. I recommend the game to anyone honestly. It's out for Microsoft consoles but will be out on pc and ps3 and ps4 soon I believe
I have Xbox Gold. My kids have accounts on the Xbox but never played live. Is it possible for my family members to play XBL since I have gold?
Each family members need to have Xbox Gold in order to play online. Since you have it, only you can play XBL. Also make sure the Xbox Gold time in your account is not expired.
It says it requires a Xbox live gold membership to play, does it mean a non-gold live player could not play this game?
Correct. It's a online only play game.
Can I play the Xbox 360 version on the Xbox One?
No
Do you have to have Xbox Live to play the "offline" local splitscreen co-op mode?
I'm not sure if it's technically possible (no way to test it since I'm linked up), but even if you can, you won't be able to play it well, and it's not a significant enough part of the game to justify a purchase. The co-op part of the game is balanced around planting "assistant" plants that are only available through card packs that you acquire online (either by earning coins in-game or buying them for cash) through the EA servers. No connection, no packs, no helpers, no way to win.
Two Xbox live accounts needed to split screen for two players for online gameplay?
Yes you do need 2 Xbox live account's to do split screen
I bought this on the 360 can I upgrade this to the x1 without having to pay full price again.
Nope- and currently your stats do not transfer
What's the difference between physical disk and digital download? Why the physical disk one is more expensive?
With the physical disk you can re-sale/trade-in. With the digital download you can't.
Is this game 4 player split-screen or 2?
Sadly, it's only 2 player local only splitscreen. And you can only use one profile at a time, so the 2 player is limited to player 1's progress. Kinda lame.

I recently purchased and returned the TX 458, Just wondering if I should give it another chance?
Absolutely give it another try! I also had to return my original for a defect, but my replacement is doing fine. I just can't race Forza 5 without it. Racing with a controller makes no sense.
How is this wheel mounted? Example I have the Microsoft 360 Wheel &amp; it has a clamp to attach it to a desk.
Same style of attachment except better if that helps. I've had both.
Does this have the most recent update? And did they fix all of the earlier batch problems?
There good now you'll still need to updated on a PC to the latest firmware.
Is this wheel compatible with Windows 8.1?
Yes
Can you buy the power cable separately, as I've lost mine. Or is it a proprietary connector, which I need to buy one direct from thrustmasters
you'll most likely have to get it directly from Thrustmaster since the connector setup looks like it is specific to their product.
Is there a version of this wheel to avoid? I heard some of the earlier batches had problems.
The people having problems didnt take the time to update to the newest and correct firmware. Even the one I ordered had issues when I first tried it. After the update and applying the correct in game settings, everything worked perfectly and continues to this day. I hope this helps.
I really want to get this wheel since it's the cheapest force feedback option for Xbox One but the durability issues concern me. Is it worth risking?
I have not had any issues with my wheel. I use it a lot on my Xbox and some on my pc. A few friends have had theirs since not long after release without issues. I was a bit hesitant also when I bought it but I'm glad I ordered one. Has made Forza horizons so much fun.
What voltage is using: 120V or 220V?
120v the power block is now internal so all you have is about a 5 foot power cord.
Why my alienware said it can not recognize this device? somebody please help me. How to get this work on pc.
I don't know if amazon will let me spell it but here it is http://www.thrustmaster.com/en_US then go to downloads and choose your system thrustmaster dot com just in case you don't see the link
does this support a headset?
Hello Angie. No, this wheel don't have any input for Microfone. You will need connect your headset to your controller.
is the adaptor universal? or can be use in 110 thru 220v?
Not universal but can be used in 110 true 220v in my country(turkey) we use 220v and i do not have any problem about that. Great product, you should buy it.
Will this work in the US? Also does this have a trickle charge or auto shutoff?
Yes it works in the US, and yes, it will charge your controllers until they are full, then it stops. I own this item, it works great!
does it charge one controller at a time even if you dock both at the same time, and automatically charge the second after the first?
it charges both at the same time:) and it will stop charging one once it's full.
Does it damage the controller's battery if left in the charger for over a day or more?
No, the charger has an automatic shutoff so it won't keep charging. It's designed to hold the controllers until you are ready to use.
How long is the AC cable? I want to make sure it will be long enough to reach the outlet.
Standard legnth, 6ft.
Does this charging stand require that you attach some type of receiver to the actual controller?
No, you just push down on the controller once set in the cradle and it "clicks" into place and starts charging. It's instant.
Does anyone feel it charges to fast causing the controller to NOT hold a charge as long as it may have before using this charger?
I haven't used any other chargers, so it is hard to compare, but this is my personal observations so far (2 months of use): I have not noticed any decrease in charge capacity after use. Typically mine will charge from 1/3 to full capacity of controler in 1.5 to 2 hours, this doesn't seem to be too fast.
How do you know when it's done charging is there like some light or something
Light is either blue or off on the controller. I know when I first plug it in its an orangish color.
Anyone know when Sony's actual stand is being released in the U.S.??? It's been on the UK site since the PS4 released but still nothing here.... and I'm getting my PS4 in June '14.... http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-PlayStat...
Found it on amazon and ebay for about $90... but i got a stand at game stop for $19.00 not official but it's just a piece of plastic
Will it charge the Gold Wireless Headset ?
No. You cannot use it to charge the headset.
How is the Internet functionality? Looking to give to daughter in lieu of a tablet. She would use it to listen to YouTube, play Internet games, etc.
Would not recommend as an internet machine. Has basic functionality but not the greatest. Better as a game platform.
Can you use old Nintendo cartridges for this product or do you have to purchase new games? Thank you
You can use old games - regular DS, 2DS and 3DS games work on it.
Is this programmed in English?
yes but not if you order one from Japan they are regional blocked
Is this a genuine 3DS?
yes
What region is this from?
North America.
How do I choose the pink color?
ASIN B00EOAMRH6 is the pink color. The other colors have different ASINs.
Is there Italian language too?
Yes
Hello ! Is it possible to change the language into german ?
Unfortunately, the system that I received can only select English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese as languages.
Hello ! How could I get warranty claims if something does't work here in germany, do the german games fit into the U.S. version ?
Nintendo, like many other purveyors of electronic media, enforce a region lock on many of their systems and games. Unfortunately, the 3ds line is region locked and the United States and Europe are in two different regions.
On another amazon link for the SAME device it says "newer version available" &amp; points to this one. What's the difference?
You'll have to link to the other device for specification. This is an XL model, which makes the screen bigger.
does this controller work on pc?
Yes my son uses it on his laptop. Windows 8.1 lenova laptop
Does this work with the God of War Saga games? I can't press the buttons fast enough and want to play the games.
I don't understand. Of course it will work for God of War, it's just a standard PS3 controller. The buttons are incredibly responsive. The d-pad especially is wonderful, although I'd expect you won't use that if GOW. The face buttons have nice rounded edges which is great for standard beat-em-up fare like rapid square/triangle combos. I have a callus on my thumb from playing Castle Crashers on a stock PS3 controller. The HORI works much better for me.
Does it work with steam on pc?
Mostly yes, that's more game-specific, you'll probly want an external remapping app such as joy2key or Xpadder for some games.
Does this controller come with the cord? I understand from the description it is used only with a wire, just asking if the cable is included.
Yes it comes with the cord. The cord is attached to it .
Does this controller have a USB plug?
Yes
Does the controller have the gyroscope feature?
Not sure about that unless you mean the two thumb controllers that rotate sorta like a gyroscope. It also has a turbo feature.
Does it work on a Mac? Please no guess or opinions. A feedback from someone that's using it on a mac would be appreciated. Thanks
It only works with the PS3, so no it does not work on a MAC.
Does this controller work well with TW14?
Yes
can you use more than one stinkyboard on the same computer? y know. cuz i like have two feet last time i checked. wait. yup... two feet.
Hello Eric, You sure can use 2 Stinkyboards at the same time. You can actually use as many Stinkies as you have USB ports. Each board can be given a unique name and programmed separately.
Can this be used on several computers? Is the configuration stored in the peripheral?
Yes, you can use it on several computers. The configuration is stored in the peripheral. Steph
Does this support "Repeat Hotkey while Pressed"?
Yes...it has a "pulse" setting that can be used to repeatedly press a key rapidly and also has a adjusting rate to set how many times per second it will press.
Can you press 2 buttons at the same time?, for instance up + left?
No, it only accepts on key press at a time at a time. There are some games or software where it's quite handy (at replacing those awkward key reaches for crouching, ducking, throwing a grenade, or swapping weapons) there are other games (WASD) where it's not as useful for steerage. It can do dual-key commands, but sadly it does not do macros. It's a niche product and takes a little bit of a learning curve to train yourself to use it. It's a very sturdy product that uses Cherry keys and will likely outlive me, but I do not use it in all situations.
Is it possible to bind the Windows Volume control to this? One YouTube review said it cannot be done.
I think it is possible. One switch to increase and one to decrease volume. However, figuring out which keys to bind may be tricky.
Does this support click and hold? If I want to map it to Vent/Mumble push to talk button, can I keep it depressed to keep talking?
Yes, it does. It uses MX Cherry switches, so internally it works just like a keyboard.
can this be used on a ps4?
Yes
Can it completely replace a computer mouse and do accurate mouse arrow movements, right and left clicks?
No - it's very clicky in each of the four directions, and slightly sticky. I've found that even just using it as arrow keys is difficult, w.r.t. getting precise motion.
Does this work for regular computer/office uses? In other words, not for gaming but for ergonomics when using computer keyboard heavily?
Sure. The driver is always loaded. You can bind the four switches to anything you like.
How quick is the reaction time?
Just like a keyboard. Thing is great
Will this work with Tritton Triggers?
I'm not sure what triton triggers are, but I have a pair of high end triton headphones that I use with my Xbox 360. I purchased this cable to replace the oem one that broke! Hope this helps some!
Will it work with tritton primer
Yes, that is why I bought it, and it works good. Yes
Will this wire work with my Tritton Kuni headset?
Yes
can i control game volume?
nope, only a mute button and a chat volume button
can i control vg volume?
Yes.
Will this work with the Tritton TRIGGER headset?
Brother this won't work with ANY headset....save your money. Five bucks wasted is not a savings.
Would tritton ax 180
Mine did not operate/function Waste of money. Don't do it.
will this work on triton Q9 headset?
it may its a 3.5 attachment
Will it work for tritton kunai?
Yes it works great and for that Price you can't beat it.
Will this work with a Universal Afterglow headset
I honestly don't know. I bought it for my turtle beaches. But i've yet to find anything that it actually fits. Won't work on tritons, razers, or turtle beaches. I wouldn't recommend you buy it.
Will it work with a US playstation? I've never bought a game that was rated by PEGI (usually ESRB) so I don't know if its a different region.
I am not an expert or anything but i have a US PS3 and it worked fine. Though I would take Note before buying this that you have a HDTV and HDMI Cord because this game can only be played in 1080p.
will i be able to use dlc from this game if i download from us version even though its unlocked what region is this game from?
If you download the US version, you'll be able to use the DLC. The hard copy is from Europe and they do not have DLC. I hope that answers your question.
GameSeek has this game listed twice for 2 different prices. Can you tell me how they are different?
Most of the higher priced one piece games are the English games and Japanese ones sell for less
What language are the dialogues, subtitles, and the game menu?
English, only the audio is in japanese

is this disc full?? the 5 episodes are on the disc?? or the episodes are for download?? ... the disc is in spanish??
Yeah the five episodes and the dlc are on the disc, the game is in english
If you buy a used version do you still have free access to the '400 Days' DLC? Any restrictions with the used versus the new?
It's on the physical disc, not a code or DLC you have to grab from the store.
We have only been able to play the 1st of the 5 episodes. How do we access the other 4?
It depends on what format you are playing it on. For me, I was playing it on Playstation 3. I know that it gives you episode 1 for free on the IOS app as well as Android, and then after that you have to pay either $5 per additional episode or you can buy the season pass, which I believe is $19.99 which also includes the 400 Days bonus episode. Either way, you have to purchase the remaining episodes, no matter what platform you are on, unless you buy that disc version of the game. Hope this helps.
I'm afraid that I won't like this game, does the gameplay suck? I hear it's like one of those "click and move" Nancy Drew type things (no offense).
Right it is a move and click game which might not be for everyone. I enjoyed it and the game has a great story, which you are the creator of episode to episode.
is this a first person game?
Yes. It's a survial game. You will be shooting and fighting zombies also there's diolouge and choices you have to make quickly.
I'm living in Singapore(asia).Can I download the DLCs with my asia account or must I set up US psn account?
need set up with psn account otherwise waste money
Is it possible to change the language into German ?
Yes, it is possible. I'm so sorry I missed read the email I was sent regarding Marie's question!
Wanted to get this for a 14 yr old, is it sexual?
Nope. It's a good thing too, because that way you will only be subjecting a freshman in high school to some harmless violence (e.g., smashing a man's brain in with a pallet) instead of something truly horrific like sex.
How long is the game?
To finish the game is not so long. But to see all the possible routes, you need very very long play.
first or third person perspective
Third person except for a couple of shooting sequences in episodes 3, 4, and 5.
I bought the odin seiya DLC but even though i have it installed on my ps3 I cannot use it? anyone else having this problem with DLC?
Yes because like me you bought the UK version right or Asian. End you are trying to play it in the states. Which is a different format and the download content only works on the US version so they match up I bought all the downloads and can't use them either
does work on any HDTV?
Yes, it has nothing to do with tv itself, it is more related to the console region, but this one is region free so will work on any ps3.
will this work on ntsc ps3
Yes it should my game still works fine
I was wondering does this game has two players that you can play with a friend?
Yes it does , its an amazing game , you could also do a set of multiple characters and arrange them into fights to get to the top

Yes I live in arizona

Hello, I want to know if if the cover looks like the one in the picture? also, does it have spanish subtitles? thanks

What DLC is not included in this? The Headhunter packs?
No, There are no headhunter packs. This is still an awesome deal because of the 4 DLC already included, each a game in itself. There are 5 headhunter packs total. Xbox live had the headhunter packs for 50% off yesterday. Might still be going on...
Is an internet connection required to play this, and is it an open non-linear playing field? I have Skyrim GOTY and FalloutIII GOTY, love them both.
You don't need an internet connection to play it, and it's kinda open ended, it's linear in a Skyrim sense, but parts of the world can only be unlocked through story quests.
The game comes in spanish? I want it in Spanish?
this game does not say that it is in spanish we only have it in english. thank you and have a great day.
is the DCL on disk or is it code??
Brand new CD so you can get rid of your other one. :D

It comes with all the DLC. My copy did not come with any pre-order bonuses, if that is what you mean.
Is the DLC included on the disc or does it have to be downloaded?
Its on the disc it just installs it to your harddrive just make sure you have enough room on it.
What is included with the game disc? Does it come with a map of Pandora?
If you need a map to play, go on the Internet. This is one of the best fps rpgs out there. You want it
Can you use characters from original boarderlands 2 disc?
This just comes with dlc. You can still play as the gunzercer, siren, assasin, and soldier, but it adds the mechromancer and psycho. You meet the characters from the original game in the story.

No. This game comes with all the latest updates, patches and DLCs. The DLC's for the game though you will need a hard drive for since they take up 4.5 space of storage.
Region locked?? Is this game region locked or not? There seems to be conflicting info
In Ireland and it works fine.
Where do I enter the code it gives me?
Hi Coleman. If you search up "Football Manager 2014"on the Amazon search bar, once you are on the page you should look at the right side of your screen and it should say "Go to your Games library". Above that you should see "How to redeem this item" just click on it and it should give you the instructions. Just incase that doesn't work, here is the link for the instructions
hello all - anybody confirm if this runs on vmware - may have jumped the gun on my purchase as this is my only option.
If you are running Windows virtually and that VM meets minimum specs I don't see why it wouldn't run. Keep it mind if the VM doesn't connect to internet at all, you will want to get the disc version.
do i need steam to play this? what if i don't have it? can't play?
If you have the disc no However if you have the code yes Luckily you can play off line after you download it, and downloading steam is very simple and fast

Does this Bundle come with the Legend of Zelda Windwaker game?
Yes it comes with two codes you enter at the nintendo eshop. One is for a downloadable digital copy of Windwaker and the other is for a digital copy of the Hyrule Historia the history of the legend of zelda game series. And I must say that Windwaker looks amazing and the few little things they added/improved like the speed sail so you move faster through the water is great!
Does this bundle come with Nintendo Land?
No, only Wind Waker.
How many GBs is this console?
32GB, just like the deluxe version. About 3GB is used by the system, but you still get about 29GB
Does this bundle come with a wii u Remote and nunchuck?
No, Wii U system and Gamepad only.
Does this bundle have the new high capacity GamePad battery that lasts up to 8 hours? Or, is it still the original one that one lasts 3 to 5 hours?
It's the standard battery, but it lasts a good amount of time. Unless you're going to be playing all day without a break, it should be plenty. Also, are the extended replacement batteries even out yet? I was under the impression those haven't been released yet (as of this writing).
Amazon, How exactly is $399 a "Lightening Deal" for Wii U when the MSRP is actually lower?
I don't know you tell me.
Has the box been opened? If not, is it shrink-wrapped?
When I received it, it had not been opened. It is like if you would buy it from a place like Walmart. Everything is there.
How long do I have to redeem the download codes?
I'm not entirely sure but since they're still selling it and sometimes products take awhile to move I would imagine there isn't an expiration date. At the very least it would probably be good until their next console comes out. However, like I said I'm not that sure on this since I just did mine a couple of days after I got it. If you're thinking along the lines of holiday presents then I would say you would definitely be good there.
does the wii u have a hdmi port to play instead of the red white an yellow wires
Yes, it has both ports, hdmi and component
so the wind waker this comes with is not a disk??????!!!!!!
No
Does this come with X &amp; Y games as well as the 3DS?
No it does not.
What region is the 3DS for? Europe, America etc..
America.
is this include Pokemon x y
Unfortunately, No Its Just The System
If i buy this and it breaks does this has warranty?, sorry for asking it's for my little cousin.
Depends on how you break it. If it breaks from faulty parts or something similar, it's under warranty by Nintendo. If you take it outside and jump on it and then smash it with a hammer, then no I don't think so. :)
Which game cartridges will play on this ds?? Will ds xl work?
This gaming system can play DS games as well as 3DS games. All DS games should work in this system.
Does this 3DS XL purchased on Amazon come with the manufacturer's warranty (Nintendo warranty)?
ours was brand new in the box. yes it has a 1 year warranty
My sons 3DS XL broke, does this come with a warranty?
I dont think so
Is there really a difference between a gaming keyboard and a regular keyboard?
Gaming keyboards have faster reaction times
i cannot turn the backlight on even when i press Fn+esc
I believe the red one is the older version and do not have the backlight.
how do i adjust the back light ?
The kb delivered to me is different. Amazon.com made a wrong delivery.
How loud is this keyboard when you press the keys? My keyboard is a very OBNOXIOUSLY loud razer that's key presses can be heard through closed doors.
It's pretty quiet. The quietest keyboard I have ever owned. Had mine for almost 6 months and I use it very heavily. Outstanding product for the price
Is it a mechanical keyboard?
No, but it look pretty awesome and fairly easy to setup.
is this for mac?
Not sure if it will work for mac... Connector is USB port :)
can this be connected to a laptop?
Yes. Just let it install the driver automatically.
includes subtitles in spanish ???
Assassins Creed Ezio Trilogy comes with three separate games: Assassins Creed II, Assassins Creed Brotherhood and Assassins Creed Revelations. All three have the option of Several spoken languages, including Spanish. However, Assassins Creed II only has subtitles in English. The others have many choices for subtitles, including Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Norwegian, etc.
Must I install the games or can I directly play them from disc?
You can play directly from the disk. There are three discs, one for each game
Is this trilogy a good place to start for a totally new beginner to the entire AC franchise?
Yes definitely
Does this package include All DLC content for all 3 games?
No
is this game package brand new not used and in original wrapping
Yes
Are the discs stacked on top of one another or do they have separate disk trays? I'm a collector and stacked discs tend to get scratched.
The discs are in separate disc trays
Are all of the games in the picture the games your getting?
Yes. They are all in one case on separate disks. The case looks just like the picture
Is it a multiplayer game?
Yes, it has online multiplayer 4-8 players. It has an offline campaign of 1 player.
Are they all on one disc or 3 separate discs?
They are 3 separate discs.
Do the xbox 360 achievements still activate? Is this all three games in one place, or is it like they took each game disc and put it in one box?
If you mean all three games in one place as in three games on one disc, then no. But it is all three games in one place in that they took the three discs, discarded the original boxes, and put them all in one box. Since the games are unchanged aside from a missing case, the achievements do all still activate.
what is the size of the hard drive
500 GB
Does this package bring two Dualshock 4 controllers?
Yes, it is excellent
Will US PS4 work on 220v? or need to buy a converter?? or it has an automatic voltage converter??

yes, it has autovolt transformer. REgards

Yes if they or you have wifi or Internet connection.
Does this include Playstation Plus?
No it doesnt, and also if you make the math, theres no savings in the bundles, they charge you exactly the same as if you buy the additional items separately.
can it charge both controllers at the same time?
You have to have an extra usb cord, cause it only comes with one. But if you have two chords there are 2 ports on the console, so you can charge both at the same time.
does it play a bluray dvd?
Not sure where these other people were looking but it will play blu-ray...per the playstation.com website: "Yes, you will need to download and install PS4's day-one system software update 1.50, and then activate your Blu-ray Disc video capability with a one-time activation through the internet in order to play Blu-ray Disc films and DVD video content."
Can I play my old Playstation games on the new PS4?
No
If I remove the battery, and plug in the USB cable - will it work?
Yes, i just tried and it worked
Does anyone know if it comes in the hard-shell briefcase if I purchase it directly from Amazon?
No it does not, it comes it a plastic clear box.
How well does the Ouroboros perform on non-traditional surfaces, such as cloth?
Hello Matt, the Ouroboros performs quite well on non-traditional surfaces surprisingly. I have tried it on wood (desk), vinyl (like a fold out table surface), plastic (video game case), my razer mouse pad, and on my bed all seem to have little effect. I will say this though that it seems most important that the surface is smooth/flat. Let me know if you would like to know anything else!
What frequency/system does the wireless use? (bluetooth/rf/etc)
It does not use bluetooth. It has a dongle that is built into the charging stand, which has a micro usb port. A usb cable with a micro usb male tip and regular usb female tip is included. The usb cable pulgs into the charging tower and the pc: this setup is for wireless mouse use. For wired use, the usb cable plugs directly to the mouse and the pc: this setup unpowers the charging stand, but the mouse is being charged by the cable. Not sure what frequency the wireless connection is, but the response time is nearly identical to the wired setup. I dont play FPS games, so I may not be aware of any differences that other programs or games would allow me to notice. As for other games, drawing and painting, designing etc, I cannot physically tell the difference between wired and wireless modes.
Are the side buttons easily pressed accidentally? Is the feel of those buttons "clicky" or "mushy"?
The side buttons are well designed and will not be accidentally pressed easily, no matter what type of wings you choose. And the feel is clicky.
Supposedly there is a 3rd button on each side, was wondering if changing the panels removes that capability or not
Nope, changing from the "wing" to the "flat" side panel has no effect on the button, the panel lays over the button, also it's default configuration is for DPI throttling. Hope this helps!
Should I get this or the Logitech G502 Proteus Core?
It depends. I know the Razer Ouroboros is a great product because I use it every single day. I have not used the Logitech mouse so I can't really compare the two. They Razer mouse is more adaptable if you are left handed than most computer mice. It has a very different button layout than the Logitech though. So, it depends on how often you use the additional buttons (other than the left and right click and the mouse wheel, which are now pretty standard inclusions). If you use them often you will want to consider which ones you will be more comfortable using. I do like the stabilizing wings on the Razer mouse, which the Logitech does not appear to have. I don't know that I have helped much, but they are two very different mice and I don't know nearly enough about the Logitech to give you a better answer.
Is it compatible with mac ?
Yes. Since it is USB 2.0/3.0 compatible it is capable of being used on any OS that has USB driver support (generally UPnP)
Is there basic support in linux?
There is through a custom tool developed outside of Razer: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/razer#Compatibility
Does this mouse come with Australia power plug
You dont need a plug for it, it only needs an USB port
does this work for windows 8 as well as 7
yes!
Can I buy a copy in the us that my grandson can use in France?
I think u can
So, is it possible to play against the computer only, or are you always playing against other people online? (I know nothing about shooter games)
Yes, but only in a mode called Garden Ops ( you protect your garden from AI zombies) and you still need to be online. ( select private match/ invite only )
How long did it take you to download onto PC (Windows 8)? I have DSL and it is saying it's going to take 9 hours for download!
It took several hours (maybe 3-4?). But I have cable modem, so it would be faster than your DSL. That was my frustration with this purchase... downloading that much to my son's PC, and then NOT have it work unless it was on-line! Amazon never offered me a refund nor was there a way to request one.
I have an old Vista will this game work on my computer???? My son wants to play it.
I believe so. The only real issue with Vista is that it doesn't have anti-virus updates any longer. I liked it much better than the Windows 8 I have now. My son loves this game, so I'm sure yours will too.
is it better on pc or xbox?
I would say most games are better on an Xbox but the pc version of this game works really well. The graphics are great, colors are vivid and there's no lag time in play. I bought this version so our son could play it and not tie up our big screen TV. It was a great compromise for us.
Does this work on iMac?
Hi. I dont know. I buy this game and run it in my Hp laptop with 12Ghz
Does it work on Mac?
I did not try it on mac. I am using windows 7. But i think it should work on any PCs. As long as the origin server works on you pc, you should be able to play this games on that server.
Could I buy this in the US (with my US billing address) to give as a present to my nephew so that he can play it in Argentina?
Yes as long as your credit card matches the US Address.If not,Then no
I have an older PC running Vista - details state Supported OS: Windows 7/8 64bit - has anyone tried to run this with Vista?
No

how long is the cord on the Microsoft Xbox 360 Wired Controller
I bought it for my Grandson. It is approx 6 feet long. He dances around & jumps up & down in front of the Big-Screen. Plenty of room for that.
what do they mean by 3rd party controller?
It simply means that Microsoft did not manufacture the controller at one of their plants or a company That is officially licensed to manufacturer their products.
does it come with a cord
No, but there are instructions on the box that will teach you how to wire/wrap your own cord. Just kidding, of course it comes with a cord.
Does it come with a usb breakaway cable?
Yes Nathen it does I HAVE THIS controler for 3 weeks now and its still the best one ever
Does this controller have the same in hand feeling as a normal Xbox 360 controller?
Yes
How long is the wired cord?
10 feet.
Will this work on a Windows PC or not?
Yes it will work for any windows platform.
Can you turn the rumble feature off?
As far as I know, you can only turn off the lights.
does it come in offical packaging?
No, but it comes in a very professional box beside the control is awesome when u turn the light off, vibration is great, a really good investment I will buy a blue one as I got a green one ;)
How long is the cord?
Must be 3 or 4 feet. Hasn't been an issue for me because I sit next to my tower but its long enough to comfortably wrap around and plug it in the back and still have slack
Does it include a breakaway cord?
Yes it does
How long is the usb cable?
Seems to be just over 7 feet.
will it work for alienware
Yes
I see that it works for PC but will it work for a Mac computer?
I assme it should work for Mac computers. I'm sure the controller's drivers will automatically install once you plug it into the USB port on your Mac.
is there a yellow one?
Hello, Not from this company. PDP has a yellow controller that lights up. Copy and paste these key words in the Amazon search bar: Rock Candy Xbox 360 Controller - Yellow. Hope this helps! Media Branch
anyone know what size LEDs are in this remote i kinda wanna play with mine and mod it up a bit
The only thing that I could find was this: Gu5.3 LED Bulbs, Light Lamp, 50w 60w Equivalent. The wattage seems a little high but the LEDs inside these contrallers are crazy bright. I never have mine on but my kids think that its cool.
Is there a reason why the red controller is cheaper? Just curious. I want to know why before I purchase anything. Also, I am purchasing one of these controllers for use on my laptop for some games I have on here and I want to be sure it can connect to...
I'm assuming its because not many people purchase this color, so the price is going low so people start buying it. It's not like it's cheaper because its not functional or anything of the sort
Is this controller compatible with 8.1 window deskttop pc
It is. I've been playing Dark Souls 2 with this controller on 8.1
How is the quality on these? I'm aware it's a licensed controller, but I'm still curious. PC gamer, have had Logitch F310 fail on me in under a year.
My son says his still works and works well.
It says it's not recognized. However it works on my other computers. I tried the xbox 360 controller driver install, did not work. Help?
This Controller works on windows Vista, and windows 8, and is exextremely finicky with windows 7. It's really only made for xb360 though.
Will this controller purchased from the US work on an xbox 360 purchased from and used in the UK? Are the connections compatible? No red ones in UK.
It's super cheap and will break quickly. I would not buy it.
does it come with a cord
This is a wired controller. It is permanently attached to the controller on one end and has a standard USB connector on the other end.
My afterglow controller continually flashes the red light when I turn on my xbox and my xbox won't respond to it. It just flashes. Can anybody help?
Theres a button on the back of the controller try pressing that. It should fix it if not then idk what it could be
So is the afterglow AX.1 newer or older than this controller?
The AX1 is older.
If I were to use this on my PC (Windows 7) would it still light up and vibrate? Or is that just an Xbox thing?
Yes it still will light up and vibrate.
what am i doing wrong? my computer registers that this controller is present and what it specifically is, but is unresponsive in 2 different games...
I do not know if i can answer the question, but check the game settings.
Can photos taken with the 2DS be downloaded to a computer?
Yes, as long as you either have a spot to insert an SD card or you own an SD card reader you should be able to.
How loud is the the sound of the 2ds.
not very loud
Does anyone know the screen dimensions of the 3ds and the 2ds? thanks
The Nintendo 3DS system has two separate screens. The top screen is a 3.53 in (90 mm) 15:9 (5:3) autostereoscopic (3D) LCD screen with a resolution of 800240 pixels (400240 pixels per eye, WQVGA) that is able to produce a three-dimensional effect without 3D glasses using a parallax barrier. According to a spec sheet from Nintendo, the screens on Nintendo 2DS are the same size as the current 3DS model. The upper screen measures 3.53 inches and the lower screen measures 3.02 inches. Those dimensions are smaller than the 3DS XL, which has screens 4.88 inches and 4.18 inches in size. Hoped this helped.
does it play the nintendo ds lite games?
Yes
can you play regular ds games?
Yes
Do you need wifi to operate the ds
To do online functions, yes, otherwise you can play w/o wifi
I have two kids who likes the same games. Do I have to buy two of the same games or is there a "share" function to this console?
There is a "share" function between all DS' but it requires the DS without the game to download it from the other and for the desired game to allow "Download play". You should also probably note that the shared version of the game isn't actually the full game and only allows limited content for the downloader; although the game is downloaded it is also required that the two DS' stay within a close enough range to hold the wireless signal. If it's a single player game you'll most likely have to buy 2 but if it's a game like Mario kart or multiplayer centered you could probably do fine just buying one and require the kids to be civil about who gets the full content or share.
does come with a charger
Of course silly. But only a wall block and usb cable. No car charger. Amazon has a great $20 kit that comes with a car charger and nice carrying case.
Can the 2DS take a beating? How durable is it exactly?
I have 2 children that have 2DS 12year and 10years old. They take them every were. The game cards and the styles are hard to keep track of. But they seem to keep going.
Can the DS2 link to a Nintendo DSI or just another DS2? I have two sons and I would love for them to play simultaneously on one game.
To my knowledge the 2ds can only link to another 2ds or a 3ds since they are basically the same device.
Can photos taken with the 2DS be downloaded to a computer?
Yes, as long as you either have a spot to insert an SD card or you own an SD card reader you should be able to.

Hello Good Evening! I Know That Includes console accessories? Thanks and I hope your answer! :)
hi it includes Manual, charger and stick!
Does it come with any games?
nope
does it have a 3 year warent
No
is a memory card included
Yes.
my son's 2DS does not turn on - can anyone help? Its charged fully...
Not sure whether you fixed the problem or not. Sorry for the late answer. It might be a bad ac adapter you have or the battery is dead.
is the 2ds screen the same size as the 3ds xl
No its closer to the size of the standard 3ds.
This system does play the regulards and 3ds games right?
Yes to 3DS games and most of the regular games - as i was told by a Gamestop clerk.
why does the blue 2ds cost more than the red 2ds
its supply and demand. The blue one is more popular then the red so some try to sell the blue for more. Most stores sell them both for the same price.
is there a warranty with it?
I cannot say definitively. This is Amazon, and they do have their customer guarantee policies for damaged/defective products. However, I purchased mine as a used product, so I cannot say a brand new version would not have a copy of Nintendo's warranty provided with it. That being said however, I do believe that some form of a product warranty would be available to you since you are buying this product from an Official buyers/traders marketplace.
do it have a game included with this system
no it comes by itself with a charger
can you change language to english and have everything like us version and can you use your us psn account?
Yes, I imported the vita to the uk and had no problem with changing the language. The only problem I have encountered is with some games the x and o buttons swap functionality.
Please, what contents are bundled with this ps vita?
The charger, the vita itself, and paperwork.
What contents are included in the box?
Some qr cards you probably won't use. The system itself a charger (that was surprisingly long) and some manuals in Japanese. There's not much to it other than that.
I've heard the x and o button are backwards, is that true and then is it possible to change it and have x as enter and o as back?
Japanese imported Vitas do have O for confirm and X for back. You can't change that. But it's only for the main menu! If you're buying Western games, it isn't like that. I've gotten kind of used to it since the games still have O for back and X for confirm.
Can it Play North American game cartridges?
Yes, sony products are not region locked. So it can play any american game / Japanese games!
What is the difference between the JAPAN version and the ASIA version?
Only difference is color and O is select and X is back if color matters to you get the import of not get the borderlands 2 bundle with black vita slim I think it's only 199 hope that helps
A friend of mine said that the materials used for the Japan version are " less reliable", is this true?
Definitely not true. I've had mine for.... Well, I while, at least six months or so and it's still kicking haha. My friend has an American version and he prefers mine due to the color. Cuz that's really the only difference! Sounds like your friend just hates happiness and color, cuz that's what you get with the Japanese vita xD
How long is the warranty of product
It is used condition and no official warranty but I guarantee for 3 month.Thanks
Can you change it to American or is it only in japanese?
You choose the language in the initial set up. Really the only difference is color and you use circle to confirm x to go back in the OS menus (in games its normal).
What games might be affected by the change with X and O buttons?
Games usually stay the same. The only difference is in the Vita menus.
Does Conception 2 work with PS Vita TV?
I think yes! http://www.siliconera.com/2013/09/10/playstation-vita-tv-will-play-persona-4-golden-lumines-and-these-other-games/ check here
Can I play my english titles on this if there compatible?
Hold off until US release hope it will be at E3
What is this product? Sorry I am confused. An add-on for the PS Vita or a complete replacement ?? (assuming they ever unlock all the games) I just want to stream my Vita to the TV like I do with my PSP.
PS Vita TV is a stand alone high definition console version that connects to your television. It will not stream from a PS Vita handheld system! The Japanese PS Vita TV system is very limited in the US with most games and app service not able to operate. YouTube will not work work on a PS Vita tv , but works on a Vita handheld system! Crazy!!! You have to have a Japanese Playstation account to use it!! No option to connect a US account! An US version is going to be released in October 2014 and hopefully open all the locked out apps and games. It will stream video and games from a Playstion 4 console, but seem to lose connection quite a bit for me. Hopefully after the US release all these problems will be worked out. The system has great potential, but Sony seems to be holding it back and letting it die like the Vita handheld.
How do psp games look on the big screen?
Psp games look really bad, not meant for big screen. Images are stretched and very pixelated.
Can the Japanese Vita TV's AC adapter plug into a US wall socket without problems?
Yes
If I buy the US version, do I have access to compatible digital vita titles I purchased in the PSN store? If so, must I stream them?
You don't stream the compatible versions. You just download an play. Everything else you stream.
includes 8GB memory?
Not for me.
can you put ps vita cartridges in it?
Yes you can however there is an compatibility list. Not every game on ps vita will function correctly right now.
Can I plug a Skylanders portal into the USB slot to remote play from PS4?
No it has to be plugged into the ps4 for it to work.
Can you use the vita itself as a controller for games such as Uncharted : Golden Abyss for this device ??
When you press the Left Analog Stick (L3) you'll see a hand with a finger pointing out, moving the analog while holding the O button simulates the front touch screen. The Right Analog Stick (R3) is for the back screen and when you press the other stick while in Touch Screen mode, you'll be touch both screens. TL;DR: Press L3 for Touch screen, O button actually touches the screen
can it play american games?
My American games work just fine on it. Pretty sure games from any region will work on it though.
What does this come with?
It comes with the vita console, charger and instructions all in the official playstation vita console boxing
Is this package with Japanese?
Can you state your question in more detail. The vita is packaged with an original Japanese box therefore the package does contain Japanese words describing the vita. The only English words on the box are PSVITA, SONY, Lime and Green/White.
Can i use and buy digital games with my USA PSN account? Or do i need a Japan PSN account?
Yes
I've heard something about the O and X buttons getting switched when you run American games on it. Is there any merit to this?
Yes
Does this model come with a memory card?
Mine did not, what I can gather from the Japanese on the back of the box, I don't think it's suppose to.
I know that it comes with 1gb on internal storage can I play english games without the use of a memory card?
Yes u can play all english games, and save all your game saves on the 1gb storage without a memory card. If u decide to buy a memory card later on all saves will transfer over to new memory card.
can u play with friends
Yes. everything works just like the american version. Only diff is in home screen is O button is to confirm and X is to cancel but its no biggie
Anyone else having wireless issues with this unit? See my write up on my vita slim green/white. I'm assuming I got a lemon but would like to hear.
Yeah I've had mine for a while too, and haven't encountered any problems with the wireless, however sometimes the joystick becomes unresponsive and moves my character spuratically.
Can I use a US PSN account on this Vita?
Yes
what is this for?
It's for playing vita games on your television. . But it is region locked and you must open a Japanese PSN account. I like mine would just love it if it was region locked
is for television or what?
It is a screen-less PSVita. Think of it that way. It is a cross between a PS Vita and an AppleTV or similar. On the one hand, it is quite small and streams everything. On the other hand, the lack of a touch screen (and back screen) limits the number of Vita games it can play. However, it could stream your PS4 to another room (It will use a PS4 controller with the latest firmware). You will have to have a JPN PSN account to ropily set it up.
Does the psvita tv play call of duty black ops declassified?
It's not on the list. And only few us titles can be played on vita Tv..........
would this work with the version 2000?
Don't buy this yet it's region locked to Japanese psn aaccounts. Wait about 4 more months
Will this work in United States, and can i remote play my ps4? Looking to play COD AW and GTA V in my bedroom, my ps4 is in the living room.
Yes
If i buy this can i make a J psn account on the vita tv, and start downloading games right after?
Yes you still need a jp email address also.
What is the difference between PSvitaTV and regular PlayStationTV?
Nothing except the color and name. They are both the exact same thing.
I can play with my PSN of united states?
Yes as of patch 3.30 u can but come oct 15th will be released in us. Psn store is not fully updated yet but will be soon.
Will the Japan model have an update where it will work with NA accounts once the PS TV releases in the west?
You can't create NA account because it's region-locked. It'll allow you to update to new firmware like any other console.
Yeah I have a question lol. When is it gonna be released in the US? Seriously. I WANT ONE! no japanese version!
I think it's only available in Japan
Does this card works correctly with USA's PS Vita systems?
Yessir David, works perfectly just like a chip from here. I got mine in the mail not too long ago and couldn't be happier with all the space it has on it
Will this be recognized by Playstation TV? Sony says only 32.
It worked if you are still curious lol
Approximately how long does the shipping take for it to arrive in the US? Just trying to get a rough idea.
Thank you asking. Normal shippng:(sal/small post) is about 10~14days to US .
Is this PS Vita card in sealed original packaging?
Yes. It's sealed original packaging. If you dislike this product after purchasing from us, you can return this product to Amazom.com. Best regards,
i just bought this and i regret it. i dont need it. what am i going to do with it? i have no use for it. any idea guys?
You could sell it.
is it a good idea to format the mamory card 64 gb when you get it new?
Format or not it only lets you use 60gb
What are the average read and write speeds of this card?
Seems to be about the same as the 4GB card, but that is just based upon loading times when I used both. Haven't attempted to test with my PC for fear of possible accidental damage to the card.
I have one 8GB card and one 4GB card, with same PSN login. How do I copy all contents to this card?
Once you hook your vita up to the PC it should prompt you to install the content manager program. Using that program you can copy the data from the memory card to your PC. Then insert the new memory card into the vita and copy the data onto the new memory card.
how many games &amp; movies will it hold
More than any other memory card, depends on game size or movie size, some games are 500mb up to 6+gigs same with movies. It just gives you the maximum amount of room to budget on one memory stick.
works with psvita slim in US/CA?
It should work. I have an original OLED Vita I got from the U.S. I popped the memory card in and it worked.
So i can game online and there will no prob considering it from japan?
Online gaming and the PlayStation store both work normally and you will have no problems. The only difference between a US Vita and Japan version that I can tell is that the circle button okay's things and the X button backs up out of menus.
does the ac adapter that comes with japanese model work in USA?
Yes, the included ac adapter works in the USA.
Does it vita could ship to Cambodia country?
Hello. I can ship this item to Cambodia.
Could i change the language
Yes you can
can i change the full internal language to english?
Yeah
Hello :) , i recently ordered a vita from another seller but it was a 2006 model (asia). can you guarantee if i buy yours it will be a japanese model
My is a Japanese import but I'm not planning to sell my if you like go check out seller japan premium that where I bought my
Hello, I have a question is this ps vita system support with the other language too, or only Japanese language
It supports quite a few languages. You select the language during setup.
If you play a game where there is multiplier, would you be able to play with someone who is on an Xbox?
No you cannot. Playstation and Xbox are on two completely different networks. However, if your friend another Vita, you can play there.
Is this the original OLED display one?
No
Is this a retail boxed version - or just the loose PS Vita and accessories?
it's a retail box version, in other words, it come with original packaging with factory seal (of course, box written in Japanese)
So this is an actual video game console? Cause the price difference between the Wii Mini and U is about 200 bucks. Can someone specify ?
Yes. I got this for my kids for Christmas and it is pretty much the same thing as a regular wii but can not connect to wifi. It is also just different color. Plays all the wii games but not wii u games. Hope this helps.
Can you do 2 players on this console? And How?
Sure you can. It actually depends on the game you want to play that allows 2 players. This particular item comes with only one controller, so you will have to buy the wiimote and nunchuck (if needed). That was my case.
HD Possible? Or at least widescreen? or does it lock you into 480i?
It is not capable of any form of HD as it only ouputs 480i via a RCA cable.
can 2 or more people play simultaneously, or do they take turns (e.g., mario kart)
You can do 4 people simultaneously (even more if you buy extra equipment). When you purchase a game just look at the back of the cover and see how many players it is made for.
Do the regular wii controllers work with this system?
Yes, they work.
Is the wii mini compatible with wii fit plus?
the only difference between this wii and other one is it will not hook up to internet can not watch movies or play games with others on internet...all other functions are same...so yes it will
can you play any WII game on this or just what comes with it
Every Wii game we tried with it works great (old and new).
does wii mini use regular memory cards or hard drive or both?
None
Does it come with everything you need to hook it up?
Yes it does.
Can you use wii sports with this?
Yes
Since it's from Germany .. is this game in English? Only info is Region 2/PAL. The box doesn't indicate and there's German printing... thanks
Hi. Yes English or in German. You can choose when you install the game. So to answer your question is has both.
Does DRN free mean you don't have to get "steamed" to play it?
Yes
Do you need to have the DVD on the system to play this? I have a Netbook with external DVD.
The DVD is needed to install the game. It is not needed to play the game.
Hi... there's a post about a code being needed to play this game off line... Has anyone had an issue getting the code... thanks
The code comes with the game if it's new. If it is used you can get it from steam.
Is the claw or palm grip?
You could claw if you want to. The ergonomics are good for palming though.
the mouse pointer wont move even though it says the drivers were installed. is there a way to fix this issue?
Try delete the driver and reinstall again?
would this work with a macbook pro 2012 edition?
Yeah, any USB mouse will work on a macbook!
compatible with macbook pro?
Yes
Can I remap the buttons?
to be honest thats not something i have tried to do. sorry i couldnt be more help. but i really like the mouse, if remapping is a deal breaker maybe look at something else just to be safe, but if its not this mouse is very cool
i now know that there is a separate disc for the dlcs, but do i need xbox live to download and play them?
Nope! Everything is on the disk. One of the great things about GotY games is they come packed with everything ready to go.
I know there is a second disc for the dlc's. Do I need to install the second disc and play them with the first disc?
No you can play the first disc...or install the dlc from the 2nd...once you install it...it goes to your hard drive...both are not needed...hope this helps.
How long is campaign
First time through... roughly 18 - 20 hours long.
Why does it have a M rating?
I think because of the violence , blood , some gore, there is also a brothel, and just the subject matter over all else. But Those are the only reasons that I can think of. And why they gave it an M rating.
Will this version play on an Australian Xbox?
Yes
Will this version play on a British (EU region) XBox? Most games will but the regular version of Dishonored won't.
Yes
The game inclunded the spanihs language ?
Yes
Do I have to have an additional internal hard drive to play the DLC's like Fallout 3 wants?
I don't believe so since it never ask me for one. It just uses the internal that is there. the only reason I can think of why it would require an additional hard drive is if your drive is full. you might want to check that and delete any old saves you don't need any longer.
does this game come with a seperate cover like the elders scrolls v: skyrim legendery edition?
Mine did.
is there a separate disc for the dlcs?
Yes
How can I use this controller on my PC?
it comes with a usb dongle (hidden between the joy sticks). just plug it in and it'll self install the drivers (windows 7 tested). after that it's up to you to bind the buttons to your games. the usb cable does nothing but charge it
How long is the included cable?
A little over 8 ft, but the controller itself is wireless. It just uses a USB drive and the cable is just used for charging.
What's the wireless range on this controller?
About 10 feet. Give or take.
Many critics say that the control is delayed and it is small is that true? I SHOULD BUY IT? I really like it because it isn't as expensive, HELP
I bought the controller for my 10 yr.old grandson and he loves it.he likes playing in the dark for the illusion of the light. It was a Christmas gift. I compared it at other stores and it was the same thing but cost more. I recommend the item.
What battery does it use and people say the battery needs to be recharged do they mean charge the controller it self or take the battery out and charge it using a battery recharger? THANKS A BUNCHA TO ALL WHO ANSWER
It has a rechargeable battery built in and it also come with a 6 ft. Micro usb
can i plug the charger in and charge the controller while playing?
Yes
Many critics say that the control is delayed and it is small is that true? I SHOULD BUY IT? I really like it because it isn't as expensive, HELP
Its perfect. Nothing more (es perfecto, nada ms)
Is this a Dualshock or just a Sixaxis controller?
This controller is just a Dualshock controller. It does not have Sixaxis support
Does this keyboard have feet, to elevate the back of it?
Yes, it does. The feet flip up to raise it approximately 1/2".
Is this wireless or wired?
It is a wired keyboard. I've been happy with mine; performs great, back-lit keys are nice. Only thing i could even rag on is that i wish the Volume control knob was more sensitive. I have to spin it more than i would like to raise/lower volume. If that's my only complaint, I think you will like this keyboard. Also, I game and have never had a problem with pressing to many keys etc. and it has a windows key disabling function so you don't tab out of your games or anything else. Cheers!
Does it have programmable keys? I want a pause/play key for my media
If you consider the volume knob to be a media key, then yes. if not, then no.
Is this a USB Keyboard?
Yes it is a USB keyboard. Overall a nice keyboard for the price!
Mechanical or nawwww?
As mentioned previously, the keys are not mechanical, but they feel similar to Cherry MX Brown switches (if you know what those feel like) somewhat tactile, but have virtually no sound.
Can you see the keys clearly with the back light off?
Yes, absolutely. With the backlight off, it is just like any other keyboard. The characters are clear and a good size.
How long is the warranty?
1 Year limited warranty. Excellent keyboard!
is it compatible with mac ??
Yes, it is
how many keys can you press simultaneously and have the correct response? I ask this specifically for gaming.
Can anyone help test it? To test the NKRO functionality, reply to this thread and do the following.. 1. Hold both shift buttons (left and right). 2. While holding both Shift button, Type in the following sentence.. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" Thank you for the help
Is the LED dimmable?
no
Are these on-ear or over-ear headsets?
Over the ear. Thickly padded.
Does having the lights on eat the battery?
Having the lights on does take a lil from the battery without sacrificing allot of power. Note these are led lights and do not consume not as m much power as you think. But having them off will give you about 30 minutes of extra use after a full charge
My roommate got this and I thought it was incredibly cool and high quality. If I were to get my own pair, would the 2 wireless broadcasts interfere?
No sir. Ours never have. We use them for 2 totally different features but they can be used on the same game ad well! Just perfect for us!
do these work with the Xbox One?
yes, but are overpriced and too fragile
I just want some clarification. Some customers are saying it works on Xbox One. The advertisement does not. So, is it compatible or not?
Yes they are compatible with Xbox one. Having said that you'll need to buy the adapter for the Xbox one controller. They are an excellent head set. You'll eenjoy them.
This does come with the USB light up device just like the regular prismatic headphones? Or does the tower replace that?
The tower replace it
Is it possible to listen to my mobile device without the aux cable? via bluetooth?
No
Is this headset durable?
All I can tell you is that I have used the headset for quite a number of hours now and I can't spot any obvious wear and tear on them. Still look and function like new.
How long does it take to fully charge, and how long can you use it until it dies?
It takes less than two hours. The longest I have had it for continued used is 6 to 7 hours. Sometimes less depending on the volume configuration and the light setting.
I have two game systems. PS3 and PS4. This team works for both?
Yes. Until PS4 patches a third party Ian audio problem, you will have to use the plug to hardwire them into the controller. Cord goes from "line in" on headset to bottom audio jack on controller. The problem reportedly will be taken care of, but while it's not patched it doesn't allow for you to adjust Game-Chat audio OR the volume from the headset. You must use the settings on the ps4 menu to adjust volume and game-chat is standard. The only headset actually in full function with ps4 now that I know of is the PS4 gold headset, but with the patch on the way, this one is an obvious choice for me. Quality is amazing and super cool looking.
Mine arrived today but the plugs are inside I can't take them out?
On mine the jacks are on the station. They plug into the female port on the front of the controller.
Shipping weight?
0.8lbs
will this charge with the ps3 turned off?
Yes as soon as you power Down
can this charge the contoller even tho its not a original ps3 contoller
yes, however, mine only lasted about 3 months before it stopped charging
Can u but an adapter on the usb to charge from the wall? And does it light up like in the pic?
I have never tried plugging it into a wall outlet, I always charge them off the USB port on my home computer. Mine does light up like the picture shows. I have had this for quite a while and no issues.
Can this be plugged into a usb adapter wall charger like an iPhone? or does this have to be charged only by the PS3 usb?? i want charge without ps3 on
I bought this as a xmas gift for my daughter. Alot of people said you can use an adapter and plug it into the wall just as you would a phone.
Does this charger work on the ps3 slim.
Yes
if it's good quality, they say that the charger doesn't last much
I don't know about others but For me it's just perfect...nice product
My PS3 controller will not charge from an iPhone charging adapter; Will this work with it?
Yes it works great
Will this work with two controllers both Useing the clip on outward curved trigers?
Funciona exelentemente, solo es un poco incomodo para colocar los controles
Does this pack give a Steam key for each game, or a single key for the entire package?
A key for each
Do this game or another one on the series has a history co-op mode?
no in single player only. No co-op or multiplayer. You might also consider the redux version at this point. It had better graphics and improved gameplay over the original.
it has a metro 2033 key or is just the download?? because i want it on steam
Amazon will provide a Steam key for you. :-)
Is the key for Metro: Last Light the complete edition?
Yes, I have :)

They have an inline Mute swtich, with volume control. There is only one wire leading to the headset.
What's the material of ear cushions? Does it like faux leather? will it become messy, sand-like small pieces and take off from ear pad?
It's genuine leather and the stitching on the ear cups is superb. Also, the leather is soft to the touch.
can I use these with xbox one ? someone please answer
Yes. You will need the Microsoft Stereo Headset adapter that plugs into the controller to get game chat(that goes for any headset). This headset comes with a 3.5mm headphone adapter that plugs into Microsoft's Headset adapter on the controller and delivers game audio and chat straight from the controller. This is what I currently use for Xbox One. http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-One-Stereo-Headset-Adapter/dp/B00IAVDOS6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1402548470&sr=8-1&keywords=microsoft+stereo+headset+adapter
Does this have a USB end?
Yes
How sturdy are these headsets?
The headsets are very sturdy. They are made of quality materials and because they are designed for gaming they are heavier than traditional sets. The look and feel is outstanding and they are very comfortable (snug) on your ears. Hope this helps.
The website says that this product includes a free hard case with it, is that the same for amazon?
I did not get a hard case.
The specifications section for the 9H reports speaker response 10-2800 Hz. The 10 is quite nice but the 2800 is shockingly poor. Is that accurate?
No
Does it work easily with PS4???
No
What is the type of connector called? The one that kinda looks like a micro usb......
It's not micro usb ... it's actually smaller & has more pins. It plugs into the SteelSeries usb mini-sound card or one of the included headphone/headset adapters. One with mic & headphone connectors or one combined connector for cellphones/ipods.
Which voltage does xbox 360 use? 220V or 110V or dual-voltage?

Yes thank
Dear Sir/Ma'am, Do you know if I can connect external Hard drive is there UBS connection? Because 4GB v low.
Yes there is a USB connection.
Where do you send it for repairs when it stops reading discs only 9 months later??? Says it has a year warranty on the console?
Go to http://www.xbox360.com (I think that is right link. Going of memory as I'm sitting at a pool. ) then click the support menu. It should be easy from there. I would wait until Monday though.
Can I play Dance Central with this model? Is there anything else I need to purchase separately to be able to play Dance Central?
If you have Xbox 360 with the kinetic device, all you need is good space to dance on.
What is the difference between the Xbox 360 and the Xbox one? Also, what does the kinnect do? My 8 year wants one, and I have no knowledge on this!
The Xbox 360 has more games for younger children. The Kinnect allows you to actually connect with other people playing the game. You can limit it to just their friends. It also allows you to do interactive games because the Kinnect bar sees movement. I hope this helps!
Is the controller included ?
The package that I purchased included one controller. I purchased a second wireless controller separately.
I ordered the Xbox 360 4GB Kinect bundle. Do I need extra memory -flash drive(s) or an external memory drive? What is the best way to achieve this?
Yes (hard drive) if you download games and a lot of apps. Just connect an empty hard drive with usb.
I will be purchasing the US x-box, will it work in Europe?

You can, BUT you will have to buy a different power supply. I bought a 220v power supply through Amazon for about $23. The power supply that comes with the US version is only for 110v.
Does this come with, or already have inside of it, a wireless adapter or will I need to buy a separate one?
It has one - we were able to use it with our wireless router immediately.
My son wants an xbox. What do I need to buy him so he can play online with his friends? Does this bundle come with all he needs to get started? Fees?
This bundle has everything he needs to play the system. You will still need an Xbox Live card in order to play online which is $60 a year. If you have a High Definition TV you will also need to buy an HDMI cord in order to play at the highest definition.
Aside from the 250gb what is the difference between this 360 e and the 360. Which is more preferable for an eight year old. This is his first system
you can down load and play more games and shows.
Does it come with game codes or disks?
It depends on the bundle! I received a disk with Halo 3, and a code for Tomb Raider. Read the description carefully!
Do you need internet connection to use xBox 360?
no you do not
Does this come with a one year limited warranty? I saw a review on here that someone purchased in July and by September it was dead.
Yes

what features make it a holiday bundle package as opposed to a standard package?
It was supposed to come with Halo (which it did), a token for Tomb Raider (not there) and a free subdcription to Xbox Live (got that).
I need to buy a spare power brick. Which one should I buy? I bought the wrong one and don't want to do that again!
Well, It would be better to ask him. Remember to buy the original...

no you don't need it to play the game.

NTSC
Anyone having the problem with key malfunctioning? I only use the arrow keys for driving &amp; without touching a right or left car will suddenly turn.
yes. it happens to me too rarely though. I suspect is the software and not the keyboard it self. I also use the arrows to drive.
Does it have media keys? Like Volume control, FFW?
Yes, it have, is really completely, the best mechanical gaming keyboard.
Can i bind the t keys(the keys under space bar) to any button like t1 is shift t2 ctrl t3 is alt?
yes you can pretty much bind all keys to anything you want and save it to a profile if you want. The software roccat software is pretty awesome with plenty of options. They make it very easy to change things how ever you like. I even made my T2 key an extra esc key. I definitely recommend this board dude not because of all the lights and flashy things but bc its simply a great keyboard.
The picture shows a bunch German characters and different than usual letter arrangement, is it like that on US ordered keyboards? or is it just normal
The picture on the box is of the German keyboard layout, but U.S. Ordered keyboards will be the standard QWERTY layout an American is used to. I own the keyboard and can confirm this based on personal knowledge.
Is the red one actually fully red LED or is it blue LED? Because the picture shows blue LED.
The roccat Ryos Series keyboards are blue led only. If you want a keyboard that can change the led colors you could get the ROCCAT Isku FX keyboard. The Color of the Cherry Switches (Blue, brown, red, black) does not define the color of the leds.
Would these work with Skype on my computer if I wanted to use them for calls?
yes they will work for sure
Does this headset have mic monitoring? Meaning you can hear yourself talk
Yes it does,but you have to use it with the USB sound card and SteelSeries software. The volume for that feature is adjustable.
Is the material on the earcups leather of synthetic?
Synthetic
Will these work with a PS4? I am tired of this stringy little black wire that came with it. I need an upgrade, will these work?
http://steelseries.com/products/audio/steelseries-cross-platform-audiomixer You need this audiomixer for the steelseries siberia elite to be compatible with your ps4.
Do these completely cancel out all noise?
No, they are very uncomfortable for long hours of gaming as well.
How well do these work with placing calls on an iphone? For example, is there crosstalk? Is the mic clear and does it pick up background noise?
I have not tried this myself, i use them for the computer. There is no button to use voice control so you would have to hit the button on the phone itself, but the microphone itself is of very high quality. It is mono-directional so background noise would be minimal compared to a wire-mounted mic, and because it sits close to your face the sound of your voice will be very clear. I don't know if the iphone would properly detect the microphone because i have never tried it. I will try it with my Iphone 5S and see if things work as they should. I hope that helps
why wont the LED lights work? and/or the software show a setting for it?
Either faulty or program
la tarjeta de sonido viene con el equipo?
There is a USB sound card that does come with the product. It is not required for use if you want to use the Headset/Mic audio jacks However, if you want to use the software features, you need to have the headset plugged in with the USB sound card. Horrible Google Translation: Hay una tarjeta de sonido USB que viene con el producto. No se requiere para su uso si desea utilizar las tomas de audio Auriculares / Mic Sin embargo, si desea utilizar las funciones de software , es necesario tener el auricular conectado a la tarjeta de sonido USB .
Has anyone bought the used 60$? Because it said cosmetic damage so i want to make sure it not a big problem.
I wouldn't buy these, they mess up or break down very east due to the wiring in the left ear cup. I wouldnt want any cosmetic damage on the ear muffs and as well as the the lighting.
How well do these headphones stand against people with big heads?
I have a 23.5inch/~60cm round head measuring just above the ears. For me they have held up really well and stay comfortable.
is the keyboard rgb?
No, it has blue LED lights. No multicolor.
If you program a light effect, will it work *without* the software? (for example, while in the BIOS) I know macros would work.
I don't think so, but since Roccat still hasn't released a Windows 8.1 version I can't test it.
I see the WASD comes highlighted by default. Can I change that default to ESDF instead?
yes you can change it to whatever you want each key has its own individual light so be creative lol
So, just to be sure, when this is bought from a US customer it is a QWERTY keyboard?
Keyboard is qwerty with number pad yes
Will the computer see this keyboard preboot so the bios can be accessed with the F2 or ESC key?
Yes works fine on my X79 board pre-boot.
Is there no software for Windows 8.1?
There does seem to be some problems with one person I see bashing this product online. Searching this device and 8.1 drivers he has flooded a lot of forums, improperly. I have not one problem with this keyboard, except when playing around 3rd party's lightshow programs. I would have to uninstall Roccat Power Grid (optional software, that allows some lightshows and control through smartphone apps) and re-install drivers and firmware on the keyboard using Roccats updater and things work as normal as when I first got it. I have learned that most other lightshow programs and controls are outlived with support or just are not finished entirely to a well polished transition back to normal. But looking on Roccats website it does in fact support window 8 and further reading on forums indicate that people have been using it with windows 8.1 since driver Roccat 1.30 and firmware version 1.25. I strongly believe it is user error when installing software and hardware, their are instructions on how to do this, like, when to plug in your keyboard when installing this onto your PC, lays a big hand to success.
Is there any chance of getting a UK layout keyboard if I order from the UK?
No, but just get a keycap puller and transfer the keys to the UK layout and remap the keys to the UK layout.
will this work for usb 1.0?
If you are plugging this keyboard into a computer that has usb 1.0 ports, no. If you are plugging a usb 1.0 into one of the usb 2.0 ports on the keyboard, yes.
Is this keyboard in the American layout?:
yes.
does this come as a usa keyboard layout if i order from the us?
I asked a rep and they said it's US layout
I know the reviewers have stated that they use this stick for PC, but can I get a confirmation that this will work great on Windows 7 64-bit?
We haven't had any problems with it working in Win 7 64. It's recognized immediately as a game controller. Just FYI, from my review "There is a switch with "DP, LS, RS." This is so that the joystick can emulate either the D-pad, Left stick, or Right stick on the PS3 controller. You might have to change this switch dependent on the game."
Now, I've had many people say that PS3 sticks don't work as well as Xbox 360 sticks for PC, can anyone confirm or deny this?
I've been using the Rea Arcade on PC for a while and I don't have any problems with it.
Does this also work for ps2 games played on the ps3, the old ps3 with the actual games not digital downloaded ones?
Totally works, play Guilty Gear all the time with it.
Is the joystick restrictor plate a square or ocatagonal shape?
It is square at the diagonal points. I am comfortable with it, but the octagonal plate is easy swap.
Do all the wires you need to use this headset come with with product?
Yes, it will come with everything you need to open the box, set it up and start playing. If anything is missing or if something is not working, let us know right away and we'll help you out. You get the same one year limited warranty and the same 30 day return period as all other ASTRO products. Regards, ASTRO Gaming
Is this the 2013 version with MixAmp Pro as pictured?
Yes
I'm not experienced with refurbished products, will this have the same lifespan and quality as a new unit? I know ASTRO quality checks them the same.
I bought a pair a few weeks ago and was blown away at how nice it all is. Everything in the packaging is just like a new headset except the sleeve on the outside of the box says refurbished. There should be no issues with build quality or longevity compared to a new headset.
Does it work with Windows 8.1?
It should. You may have to update the mix amp on the Astro website. But I didn't buy the pc splitter. So you may have to purchase one sepretly or unless you can find one that comes with it.
does it work for the xbox 1
It does work but you will need to purchase the xbox one chat adapter to be able to use the microphone.
Does the mixamp still need to be updated?
For the Xbox one. The bass is too loud
is it dolby sorround sound ?
Yes. 7.1 Dolby Digital. :) The sound really is magnificent.
Does this come with the Mix amp ? and any issues connecting to ps3 or ps4 ?
Yes it comes with the Mix Amp. I had to follow instructions on a YouTube video because I had issues setting it up. It did not come with instructions.
Soooo does the xbox one have Dolby Digital 5.1 yet for thees to have surround sound ?
The mixamp that comes with the headset provides Dolby digital 5.1. I have these and an Xbox one and can attest to this
The inline cable has broken for the headset I ordered in July (2.5 months ago). Is it still covered by the one year limited warranty?
Yes it should be. Call customer support or even better if they have live chat support let them know. They'll probably have you send the broken cable to them and they will send you a replacement
I just wan to know can this be used on my PC?
Hello! Yes, but you will just need to download the driver from Microsoft.
Can this be used on XBOX Batman Arkham and Fallout?
It has Left Stick/Right Stick/D-Pad capability, so it should work. I probably wouldn't suggest using it for a real 3D game but if you want to then go right ahead
can this work ok win 8.1 64bits??
it should since my wired 360 controller still works on 8.1
Ho does this compare to the qanba q1?
This one is slightly more solid over all the the qanba. It has a standard square gate and the buttons are slightly smaller and smoother also. I own both a qanba and madcatz te stick and if I had to just one for lasting quality and performance it would be the madcatz te. It feels the most comfortable and is the easiest to mod if you so choose.
What is the shipping weight of this item as I couldn't find it neither on amazon or madcatz site?
I think it was 7.8 lbs
will it work for fifa games on xbox360 12 13 14
No Any Game That Requires the use of both the left and right analog stick it won't work sorry
will it for fifa121314
It responds as any 360 controller would. ive never tried it on fifa, so I don't know if u can map buttons on it. You can probably get a cheaper stick if that is your main use for it. Its a good stick. It has very responsive buttons and handle.
Anyone know if you can swap the art on the stick?
Its a little difficult. The art already on it is one big sticker. You will either have to have something printed with an adhesive backing or buy a plexi top.
The price was 99.99$ same as the ps3 version, why the price change to 434$?
3rd party sellers inflating the price since the last run sold out. New pre-orders on the next batch are shipping out August 15th. Prices should go back to normal after that. Retail on the new run of sticks will be $120. Source - http://store.madcatz.com/categories/specialty-controllers-category/Mad-Catz-Arcade-FightStick-PRO-for-Xbox360.html
Usable for xbox one?
No, If your looking for a Xbox One fight stick, Madcatz makes the Tournament Edition 2, and Razer makes the Atrox.
Is this fightstick compatible with PC ?
Yes, both the PS3 and Xbox360 version are.
Can I mod this stick so it would work with on xbox 360 as well?
Yes. You need a cthulu board for xbox360. It is an absolute pain in the ass from what I hear though.
How heavy is this fightstick? I'm confused, because the description said it was 14.1 oz.
It's about 3kg!
Is this wired or wireless?
It is wired.
Is the default gate for the stick square or octagonal?
It's a square gate.
does it work on ps2
No its just for ps3
Is it wireless? or you have to plug it via usb?
It plugs in Via USB to a PS3. It can be dual modded for Xbo 360 as well if you know how o do it or find someone who does.
I have an AMD chipset, will this PS3 stick work with WIN7/AMD? My HRAP TE2 PS3 does NOT work.
As long as you have the right drivers installed it should work.
Is this a smaller version of the other Mad Catz arcade sticks? The dimensions state 9.1 inches in length. Most other sticks are 17 - 19 inches.
Hmm something is definitely not correct either dimensions. The pro versions is wider a bit but not twice the length. Check YouTube.
does it have any headphone jack ? and if it does, where is it ? a picture can be good for that.
no it does not
I had the regular wii, just got the wiiU. Can I use my old balance board with this new game?
Yes, we use the balance board from our old Wii. It works great with the Wii U.
does this include the balance board?
No it does not. You can get the wii u fit with board but not sure the meter comes with. I would shop around to see what yiu can find.
will this game work on the regular wii?
No. It will only work with the Wii U system.
Does it have any multiplayer support?
Yes, more than one player may play at a time; however, it won't accumulate your data, time, or anything else that we saw. We only tried it once. We took turns back and forth trying to beat each other on a specific game/exercise but it did not keep our results. There is a 2 people run activity, but we have not done that one. Maybe we just weren't doing it correctly.
What is the max weight that the in game scale goes up too?
The listed max weight is 330 lbs. After that point, the game will turn off and not let you use the program. You can work around this limit by putting a layer of cardboard under the board. Just cut out the corners so the legs touch the floor. If you need to reduce weight even more, you can add additional layers or use foam. I have read that the board can support up to 500-600 lbs.
How many Club Nintendo coins do you get from this?
Per my son, he received 60 coins.
What are the new games?
There are too many to name. Main ones missing from old Wii version is Skateboard Arena and Parade. The other old ones have been updated for Wii Fit U plus tons of new ones with multi levels.
Does the Wii balance board work well on carpet? I notice all the pictures show it on hard surfaces like wood, tile, etc.
Yes. It comes with larger pads to put on when used on carpet.
Do you NEED a balance board in order to use the Wii Fit U?
Almost all the exercises do so yes you need one.
does it have the white fit meter?
Yes.

Almost all the exercises do so yes you need one.

Yes.
What is the weight limit for the board?
330 lbs.
Can you use this in a Wii?
The balance board itself is compatible with the Wii. However, the Wii Fit U game and fit meter are only compatible with the Wii U.
Does the balance board work well on carpet?
Yes, we use it on carpet and it works perfectly. There are foot extensions that come with it specifically designed to allow it to work on carpet.
How much space do you need to use this effectively? Thanks!
Well, basically the space it takes for the board, and the space for one person standing with the board in front of them (for stepping on and off exercises. 4 square feet? Obviously more would be better.
will this board work with my old wii disc
Yes, it will. That is the beauty of Wii/Nintendo; they always retrofit their games and equipment to the older products, so you don't have to keep forking out cash for every upgrade. Unlike other game consoles.
Is this ready to play out of box or is another console required? Do I need to buy a regular Wii U first?
A Wii U is required to play this. Once you have a Wii U, this box includes everything you need to play Wii FIT U.
I own the Wii U and no Wii Remote controllers. Will I have to purchase one for use with the Wii Balance Board?
Some games do require a Wii Remote with motion plus, and a few games require 2 Wii remotes with motion plus. A lot of games just require the balance board
is disc included
Yes.
Can I play this on my regular Wii?
The Balance board should work with your Wii, but nothing else.
will the Wii U FIT game and meter work on the Wii? Do not have the Wii U

Do you need a soundcard to let this headset work well?
Nope, as long as you get the XTD version, it comes with an external sound card. I highly recommend this headset if you have the dough for it. It's super comfy and sounds insane.
What type of port does the headset connect to, USB or surround sound? I see the remote *accepts* surround sound from your speakers, but the headset?
The headset is hardwired into the remote (the remote is not wireless) and the remote plugs into a usb port on your computer
Can you use the headset and 5.1 speaker ports at the same time?
No, There is a button on the base that will either select Speakers or Headset.
I see the the usb remote has inputs. Can I plug in my 3.5mm speakers in there?
Yes
you said it will work with a ps4. But how about using the voice changer on a ps4?
Who said it would work for a PS4? It doesn't. It's specifically for PC. The software to manipulate the voice changer and audio settings are on the PC
Does anyone know if this headset works with the ps4 either through Blutooth or by the cable?
Unfortunately the only thing the Bluetooth is able to connect to is a smart phone. As for cable connectivity, it is not intended for consoles. If you want a headset that is surround and for consoles then I would suggest something along the lines of astro, triton, or turtle beach headsets.
can you hear your own voice in the headset while chatting?
Unless you can hear what the other person is hearing(your voice) from their mic then u can't
Do these headphones have voice feedback to reduce yelling during loud games?
Yes. Right Click volume icon &gt; volume control options &gt; playback tab &gt; select KAVE XTD Headset &gt; properties &gt; Levels tab &gt; turn microphone up to 100
Can I listen to music on my phone without it being plugged into the USB port?
TLDR - No The entire headset and control module is powered through the USB. Plus, the wire that connects the headset to the control module is permanent. It would be safe to assume that this headset is very much geared towards desktop PC/Mac users.
Does the vibrate function work with music? I actually own this, but I can't seem to get the vibrate function to work with music, only gaming really.
No
how can i access the game after buying the code
I redeemed the code through Steam.
Can it be played off line?
Yes
I wanted to know in which language this game . Thank you
English
can you play this on an ipad
Nope. Windows only.

Is this a digital key or will I have to wait for this in the mail?
This is a physical copy, NOT a digital code.
Do I need an original diablo 3 before I installed this expansion?
Yes
i am using all 10 character slots already and im wondering if the xpac gives you more slots or will i have to delete a character to make a crusader?
Yes. 2 additional character slid will open up.
Is the entire "expansion" really just one additional Act V?
Yes, on the surface it appears that its just one additional act but its a long act. There are also new additions and changes made to the whole game. there is a new character to play thru all 5 acts now. There are minor changes to the gems, one being that they added a new one. to level up the blacksmith and jeweler no longer requires pages or books but deaths breathes. with the changes and the additions it is well worth the money to get the expansion pack just don't get the collectors edition. Once your character makes it all the way thru act v there is this whole other world-Adventurer Mode and rifts to play thru. So to answer your question yes its just one act but there are still so much more to it than just an additional act. If you love D3 then get the expansion you'll love it even more...
Whats the content in the box? Only the DVD? Have some manual or something else?
The box contains a CD with authentication key for installation, a note pad, several guest passes for other battle net games and a very small instruction sheet on installation. Since you have Diablo III installed all you need is the key to get the expansion.
I'm buying this for a friend. Is there a serial number or anything that I can just email it to him, or I'll have to give him the physical copy?
You can download the software straight from blizzard one you have the serial number. So of you purchase it you simple need to give the key that comes in the box to your friend. You may also be able to purchase it through blizzard as a gift and they will email a key to that person.
I have completed the D3 game in PS3. How do I import my profile to PC?
You cant. There is no cross server compatability between pc and ps3. So u would have to start from scratch on pc.
can we have more than one account or username
Only if you buy multiple copies. Blizzard's policy is one copy, one player. Your wife/husband, girlfriend/boyfriend, children, and friends can not play your copy. It is grounds for account termination.
Can you use characters developed from D3, or do you have to start fresh from lvl 1?
Yes u can!
Will the 2DS in a neoprene cover fit inside this case?
Yes
Will the protective Nerf case for the 2DS fit inside this carry case? I want the protection from the other, but need the space for assessories, etc.
I don't think it will the game system is a pretty tight fit inside there.
The description says it holds 6 games, but it looks like it holds 12 in the photo. Which is correct?
The one I received from this company has 12. There are 3 rows of 4 in the case I bought for my son.
Is this only for 2DS? Will it work for DSI XL??
no
It looks as if you can play on it without taking it out of the case? Has anyone been able to do that?
Yes, you could play it in the case but it might hinder some gameplay
Does this help with falling impact? I tend to drop my case from time to time.
It does have the extra cushion since there is a pocket for games. But to be on the safe side I would take extra caution and put your device in as shown facing in, instead of out in case you do drop it and shatter the screen. My 8 year old is who has the ds and the case, but my 2 year old has tried to get his hands on it from time to time and when told he can not play with it he throws it. And his ds still works!
Will this case hold the 2DS + AC Adapter and games?
Yes
Will the DS fit in this?
Mrs B, just checked with my grandson, and yes, the DS fits "perfectly" in the carrying case. Pamm
what comes with it is it just the case
Yes. Just the case and the small wrist carry strap.
Does anyone know who the VA for Bigby is?
The actor is Adam Harrington. He's a voice actor who has worked on several video games including telltale's Walking Dead series.
Is this for the whole series or just for the first 2 episodes?
It's a seasonpass for the whole series, but so far only episodes 1 to 3 have been released. As the series continues, the new episodes will be made available to you.
Can I download this game in a DELL Laptop if so how do I do it?
Call Amazon customer support and they will walk you through it.
I wanted to purchase this game but I do have a Steam account will this game will be able to be played through Steam?
No, it sadly can't be played through Steam as the DRM says it is for TellTale Games Account. However, Steam is now having a 50% sale of that game. Go get it right now! It's only $12.49! ;)
" This installation package could not be opened. Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows installer package." How to fix?
Easy...you need to first load the Demo....at the end of the Demo it will unlock the other episodes. the DEMO confirms your purchase after it ends

how are the buttons and joystick compared to sanwa? Or should I mod after I buy?
They are not bad at all. The Sanwas seem to return back to neutral faster even though they are a bit easier to push down. If you were going to mod I would recommend replacing the joystick before the buttons. I thought that mod was a major improvement over the stock stick. Hope this helps.
Does this work with Windows 7?
Yup! I am currently running Windows 7 and it works just fine!
what is the different from PC/PSB and the Xbox 360/PC if just using it on a PC only
On PC its no difference. The q1 is more compact than the other models but all the same premium parts. The q1 also has no mic port. The buttons are rounded so if your playing street fighter 4, you can execute slide techniques great! Its the business!
Is this compatible with the wii U? Thanks!
No
i have winwdows 8.. it is not being recognized.. i can see it devices and printers section on control panel. it is not letting me use it.. help please
You might have to download the Microsoft drivers that are required to use a basic wired controller. Considering at the base level, it's just a controller. If you google "Microsoft driver 360 wired" you should get it. It's a small download that'll let you use any wired 360 controller.
How long is the cable between the Q1 and 360 please?
A little over 5 feet.
Does this work with games such as Skyrim and Dungeon Siege on the PC.
It's made for PC as well. But I only use it on my Xbox. If it's a game that uses the stick and dpad you'll have to switch between the mode button on the top row but can't use it simultaneously
does it have a circular octagonal or square gate ? the ps3 version of it has both circular gate and octagonal gate too. does this bring both ?
It comes with square gate installed and the circular and octagonal gates in the box.
Is there any way to charge both down and left/right by holding diagonal? Tried modes, but sure if parts are flawed.
Diagonals work fine for me. Sorry I don't know why it's not working for you.
How difficult would it be to replace the USB cable if it broke?
I am not experienced with doing so because it comes with it. So I would have to strip the wire and add a new one. Which wouldn't look as nice. In all, pretty hard to replace.
Do you need XBOX live to play the ultimate edition?
Great question, no you do not! All the game of the year stuff is included on the disk so no need to download anything or be hooked up to Xbox Live.
Can u play a two player Mose for this game
Yes
Are the new characters on a disc or as a digital code? TY.
The new characters are actually on the disc
what is the difference between the ultimate and standard edition
Ultimate edition has all the new characters and all alternative costumes already unlocked, plus the challenges are unlocked for the new characters. Standard edition doesn't have any of that unlocked.
Do you have to have the original game to play this? Or does this have the original game included? Thanks!
I don't know from personal experience but my brother says the original game and this game are the same so i hope that helps
Is there an actual story line or just fighting tournament style?
Yes. There is an story Mode that follow an interesting storyline
is this worth 20 bucks??
Absolutely!! The game versus mode alone is worth the $20.. There is an original story mode also! It plays identical to Mortal Combat, it is made by the same developers after all!
Will this work on the new XBOX 1 connect?
No sir honest
The game comes in multilanguage? I want it in Spanish?? El juego viene en multilenguaje? lo quiero en espa&ntilde;ol
I assume it would.. If you just download it from the Xbox Games onDemand it will say what all languages it supports! Hope this helps lol
Will it work on PAL console "Region India" ?
I doubt it. I have had issues, in the past, with purchasing video games from retailers outside my home region. I would strongly recommend that you find a retailer in your home region to buy this from. I can't say for certain that you would have a problem buying this from an American retailer, but I would not risk it.
Does this version come with all the DLC's?
Yes it does everything is unlocked from characters to modes and etc.
good day. the game is completely in Latin Spanish.
Yes it should have full Latin Spanish but I wouldn't know because I use it in English but the game does have language settings.
Anyone know if this game is still actively played online? I don't want to be waiting too long for a match.
Yes
Can this game be played locally without an online connection? I have a 750 ping, okay to stream video, but online games are all but impossible to play
Yes
Is this actually how the casing looks with the white sides instead of blue?
Mine is in blue.
Are the graphics noticeably different from the PS3 version?
Yes
Will this game come to the Xbox One at all?
no
Does this have the TV show Green Arrow skin?
Yes
Does this work in Region 4, i.e. in Australia?
Region 1 is printed on the back.
is the dlc in the disc or u have to put the code into the xbox to get the dlc
You have to put in codes to get the DLC so it is not recommended that you buy it used.
Is XBox live (or internet connection) required to play?
No. It's just an option to play with people online.
does it have fotus armor included???
No, sadly, it actually doesn't, the fotus armor was only included in the limited console edition
is this game mature, if is tell me why
Rated `M' for Mature... Blood and Violence.
does the game have any bad words in them ,if they are what are the words
Imdb states that the game has very mild language such as "hell" and "damn" used occasionally.
i have never played Halo before, is this first person shooter?
Yes! In fact it used to be different from other FPS titles such as battlefield and cod. Halo is known for its amazing storyline campaign and its unique multiplayer. It's a start of your intrested in getting into the FPS genre.
Why s it rated m
There is some mild language, really no further than "damn" or "hell". I really never have understood the "M" rating on the Halo series. However, it is a shooter and thus you will be shooting things and though the violence is a mild form in comparison to other games. It still implies death and I think that is where it gets it's ratings mostly. I really find this game to ne more of a "T" for Teen rating, but then again, maybe I'm just desensitized...
Why is it rated m
It is rated M mainly for violence. I didn't notice any language while playing.
Does this game come with all the map pack addtitions? Or is there one missing?
yes, it comes with all maps (addon); i am a halo fan and I bought this a few months ago and was the best choice and you will save a lot of money instead buying this games separately, so grab it because it worth it
Can Halo 4 play on Xbox One?
No
I tend to leave my items charging, does this have an tickle charge or auto shut off?
It charges till its full then auto shuts off. Problem is after a while, it charges for 30 seconds then shuts off. Seems like batteries die easily. Hope this helps
How does the base recharge the batteries? Does it plug in? Or does it have to have batteries in it?
It plugs into the wall socket
What's better? This, the standard Microsoft Play &amp; Charge Kit, or the Nyko Power Kit plus?
I've always used the nyko chargers. They work pretty well and last a long time.
Charging Base doesn't light up. Battery is in correctly and controller is working. Battery came with charge so not sure if that's why no light on Nyko
There are two lights on this device that should be lit whenever a controller is docked. When this device is charging a corresponding light will indicate that controller is being charged by a red or green indicator. When controller is fully charged only a white indicator will be lit when docked.
Does this unit capable with 220V?
That I am not sure on. I would contact Nyko on it.
I own this charging station however I can't find any replacement batteries for it. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
http://www.nyko.com/products/product-detail/?name=Replacement%20Battery%20Kit%20for%20Charge%20Base%20for%20Xbox%20One $7.99 for a new battery
Can use this to charge xbox one console?
You can charge two engines and one device
Is it worth it
Yes, you don't have to keep buying batteries all the time.
What's better, Rayovac AA rechargeable batteries or this nyko charge base for the xbox one. Which one will last longer?
I haven't try the Rayovac, I always have NYKO. I believed the battery has a lifetime warranty on it.
Love this unit, anyone know where I can buy additonal compatible batteries? Link would be awesome, as I can't seem to find them anywhere.
You might try best buy or GameStop
Works to place tablet 8.3 inch LG G PAD?
At first I thought no, but it actually telescopes out enough for my google nexus 7. It still had about an inch more of telescoping it could do
Has anyone tried this with a PS Vita Slim? I assume that the previous question about the Vita applied to the original model.
I have the slim. It works to hold it but it is not extremely secure. I am trying to find a way to make it more secure.
will this clip fit with a bluetooth keyboard attached to the controller as well?
will this clip fit with a bluetooth keyboard attached to the controller as well?
Does this safely hold a Playstation Vita?
If you put Velcro tape on the Vita and on the Nyko clip, yes. Without Velcro tape, no.
Work to place tablet z3 compact tablet??
the tablet z3 compact has a width of 4.866 inches, the max that the clip will hold is 6 inches. so yes it should fit/work.
Can be used for sony Z2 tablet?
No. Only for phone size.
Will this hold an Lg G3?
The clip opens up pretty far, Im sure it would
I have Sony Z3 since its a clip is it going to hit the power and volume buttons?
It sure does. But it rests lightly enough on them that it hasn't been a major issue for me.
can i use this control with my blu life one x?
Yes it will support phones up to 5.3"
is there a version of this for the 360 gamepad
This product is a platform for the PlayStation 4.
Had this less than 6 months and both broke the things on the back(is that called a dongle?) -is this normal and is it something under warranty?
I'm sorry this won't answer your question, but for both to break within 6 months seems that it could be a defective product or batch. I've had mine for quite a while now, and my fingers never come across touching or bumping the dongles (and I have large hands). I have never had an issue sliding them back into their base. They work amazingly. I wish I knew where I put the original packaging to see what the warranty was, but it will NEVER hurt to contact them and explain your situation. Nyko has been great about handling defective accessories. If you have the documents that came with the unit, contact them. If not, you probably can find their customer service connection on their website to address the situation. I hope this helps a little. ~C
Is there anywhere to get another dongle? I lost one and need two for my two controllers.
You can get them direct from Nyko. Just search online for it. I think they're five bucks but may cost shipping. They aren't available anywhere else that I can see.
I know it says that the station will let you know when the controllers are fully charged, will it prevent overcharging?
Yes it will stop charging once the controller has fully charged
Has anybody tried to wall mount this base?
Its not possible to mount the base due to the way the controller are setup (gravity) Check out my review video on it youtube.com/deejaystech
Does it extend the battery life of the controller?
The charge base doesn't, however Nyko makes a battery pack that is compatible with this base that does and it works very well. The wonderful thing about the charge base is you don't have to fight with the micro USB plug to recharge your controller. You plug the dongle in and it's the last time you have to deal with that stupid plug.
Is there a way to hang it or attach it to the wall?
I would not recommend it. Thank you for asking.
Can this charger be mounted vertically (ex: on a wall) and still work without the controllers falling?
Nope works with gravity hahaha its the only thing making the pins charge the controller there is no clip o holder just gravity
Is is possible to power this with a USB cord running from the PS4?
No it's designed to be plugged into an outlet.
ac or usb
It is an AC unit that uses dongles connecting to the PS4 controller. Then all you need to do once the dongles are connected to the PS4 controller is sit it on the charger base. I like the design a lot and don't ever have to worry about scratching up the area around the charge plug anymore now.
Will this work if i have a silicone case on my controller
Not sure...the charger has a little plastic adapter piece that fits onto the controller. It's fits pretty tight on the controller. If your case is very thick...I don't think it will work.
I only have xbox 1 can I reedem in the computer in the xbox page and then download on xbox 1
Yes Sandra.
Can I use this code on my Xbox one and on our xbox 360 in the home or is it an either or code?
It's one code. You enter in to the xbox 360 and it downloads, and then you go I cod ghosts in the Xbox one store and it will be free. So you get both versions
Hi! Will this code work on a foreign account or just on an american one? Also, how long after the payment confirmation till the code is emailed?
Although I am not sure if it will work on a foreign account. I'm pretty sure it will though. The code does not get emailed, it is shipped to the address that you put in for the order. Enjoy! It's a great game.
If I want to put this on my 360 can my friend put it on HIS Xbox 1..?
No, You can only activate the game on one Xbox live account. So if you activate it the Xbox 360 copy on your account, the same account will be allowed to download the Xbox one edition. You can sign into your friends Xbox one and play from there, but he wont own the game.
Can i redeem right away one the Xbox One?
You have to download it to your xbox 360 first. Then it will be available for free on your xbox one. If your consoles share the same xbox live account.
Can i redeem right away one the Xbox One?
If you mean as soon as you pay for it no. It will be sent to you in a plastic case with a download code for ghost xbox one and 360. It took at least 3 to 5 days to receive the codes.
can you just email the code?
Sorry we cannot.
If I already have this game download on 360 would I still be able to redeem it and get it on xbox one?
Yes
Will you ship the case or just email the code?
I already shipped this back to you. It was a quick turnaround back to you. I shipped it back the same way that you sent this to me. It was a return to sender package. You did not have the disc inside.
code for xbox because one does not work? I feel cheated
Once you redeem it on 360. Search for the game on the xbone store. Should be a free download
Does this game have a good and interesting story line? and does it look good?
The game looks amazing....the story line is short and its the actions are limited and repetitive. It would be a lot cooler if you could venture off into the world but you can't.
How long did it take to install yours? Mine's going on 5 hours, and it isn't installed enough to actually start a game.
for all xbox one games go to xbox one settings, network then click go offline and all games install faster however when you enable this again youll have an update for the game but its still faster to install
Is this hack and slash like God of War? Is there any thinking involved?
Not really. You have a sword and a shield, "X" uses your sword and "Y" uses the shield. There really aren't combos to speak of other than going back and forth with a combination of your sword and shield. Some enemies require a "heavy" attack where you hold in "X" or "Y" and it will break their guard. You hit"B" to do a roll move, which you will need to do for some enemies. It's a beautiful game though and the multiplayer is pretty fun if you have a friend to play with. Worth it if you can find it used.
Is there any sexual content or obsene language in this game.
no all positive language
Can this game be played entirely with Kinect? I saw a trailer advertising it as a Kinect game but all gameplay video show the player using a remote.
This game is played via controller only though one has the ability to control legions with voice commands via Kinect.
Hi, What postal service do you use to send the game?
Usps first class!
The gameplay videos I saw looks like it has a huge amount of quick time events. Is this true for the whole game ?
Every time you have to finish an enemy off he glows the color of the buttons you have to press, so its basically lots quick time events without the actual buttons showing up on the screen, But you will be doing Very short quick time events throughout the whole game.
does this game require the kinect
No you can hold LB instead of using Kinetic during the speaking parts like "fire volley" etc
Is there a way to tell if an Xbox One game is exclusive? PS4 games say "only on PS" etc. Am I missing something? I want to pick exclusives to buy.....
Unfortunately, there is currently no indicator for Xbox One exclusives on the game covers themselves. I would recommend using a guide such as this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_One_games.
Does Forenza 5 for Xbox One allow splitscreen multiplayer?
Yes it does. No LAN play though. :( which seems to be a thing of the past these days.
What cars do you start with? Can you get a Mustang?
Yes, the 2015 mustang is a free dlc
Can you still hire a driver to race for you???
Yes
Do you need a steering wheel to play this or can you use the standard controller?
No steering wheel needed. I personally like to play on the controller since I am used to it but if you really want to, there is a wheel for the xbox one called the Thrustmaster TX Racing wheel that you can buy for about 200 bucks. And there are also some optional add ons. But no, you dont need a wheel.
can it support a Korean language ????
I'm not too sure about that one. I know the game supports many languages but I can't say for sure if Korean is one of them.
Are all of the cars that you can buy be earned through playing the game, or are some only available through micro transactions alone ?
Can't earn all of them...gotta buy with real money...sucks.
Do you have to play this game online?
No
why can't you make it for xbox 360
A lot of what this game does well to set itself apart from previous installments is features such as drivatars, new vibration system, improved physics, and advanced visuals. These things are for the most part probably not possible on the 360, so what would be the point to release Forza 5 with less content and features on last gen without these new additions to the franchise? I really don't see any.
Can two players play this game at one time?
Yes. The game will switch to split screen. However, you can not play online with two people using the same xbox.
will this play on the 360?
No. Forza Motorsport 5 is only playable on the Xbox One entertainment system. Forza 4 and Forza Horizon are two racing games, from the same franchise, that are available on the Xbox 360.

I havent played the prior Dead Rising's. Should I play them for any story knowledge or can I jump right into this game?
There are a few instances, especially at the end, where prior knowledge of the Dead Rising universe lore would be helpful for understanding the plot twists. However, you could still play the game and have a great time without prior knowledge of characters or meta plot.
Is this game exclusively for XBox One - or can it be played on an XBox?
You can only play DR3 on Xbox One and not on the Xbox 360. This game takes full advantage of the Xbox One's new hardware, especially the Kinect.
Is this a FPS game?
No
I just bought an Xbox One. Should I pick this game up or pass? Is it anything like The Last of Us. I really liked hat game.
Well it depend on you. If you really enjoy play "kill zombies" or something. I like this game. I not really play this game a lot. I love build new gadget, vehicles, and ETC. If you play deadrising 2 and you like it then you will love deadrising 3. I promise.
Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Other players can joint your world, or you can join theirs. There is no split screen.
If you buy the hard copy of this game how much does it have to install to your xbox one?
It installs the same amount whether you get a hard copy or a digital. Only difference is you're pulling from a disk rather than downloading it using your Internet speed so it goes faster(unless you have blazing Internet speed). There may be a slight difference, but not enough to choose one or the other.
I have twin sons who want this game. Is it for 2 or more players?
yes online you can play but for first timers I recommend that they should play single player mode before trying two player being you can only use two player mode with another xboxone lat leas as far as I know
it comes with other languages? portugues ?
Yes
Is it $20 more than the black controller because of the color?
No. Did you read Japan Import? Is $20 more because it is imported. Sony announced that they will release the wave blue in US for 60 bucks in the fall.
These controls are 100% originals?
Yes. Our inventory is 100% original products of Sony Computer Entertainment.
How is the packaging and condition of this controller?
Thank you asking. Package; Nylon bag (water proof) and New cardboard box Cushioning material (paper etc) And This item is New. Best regards.
Is this controller made by Sony?
That's right. It is a product that Sony has produced.
I'm sure this is dumb question but, does the mouse change colors?
The mouse does change colors. However the click wheel has 5 main color presets and can not change (green,red,blue,purple,yellow, maybe pink too?). But the numbers and the logo will change to any color you can think of with an amazing color palat that lets you change the brightness, hue, contrast,ect. You can even do black lol! Hopefully that answers your question
Did anyone have any luck with the software? It's extremely confusing and I'm having trouble with it.
Hey J, I found the software nomenclature to be a bit confusing. Mode, was not clearly defined. This turned out to be your profiles. They are selected with a button on the bottom of the Venus mouse. Each of the five different profiles (mode 1-5) has an indicator color which lights the scroll wheel. In the profile setup you have a series of five DPI presets each with a pair of sliders for x and y axis. Generally you would want the x-y to be parallel. But for a special program use you may want it slow left and right and fast up and down. In that case the x-y sliders would not be parallel. These are selected from within the current profile (mode) with the up-down arrows behind the scroll wheel. This will light up a series of 1 to 5 lights on the top of the mouse indicating which DPI setting you have engaged. You may like 5 lights but prefer a slower setting just pull the x-y sliders down to the desired setting in the 5th DPI.
the thumb buttons, are they mechanical or membrane?
The thumb buttons are mechanical keys. They also have a curvature for quick button finding. There is #1-#12 keys.
What is the surface material on the mouse? Is it soft touch smooth plastic (PU)? I have a Logitech G602 wireless and it has a pebbly texture I hate.
Yes it is smooth plastic. It feels very good when u touch it. :)
If you use the mouse on a mac, are the side keys set to the numbers on the top of the keyboard?
Nope, they are extra programable keys.
can you program this for things like Adobe Photoshop editing steps? thanks.
You should be able to bind them to anything, usually it binds to keyboard key(s), anything in photoshop that can bind to key(s) is thus covered by this.
Redragon Perdition, is that you? Outside of being ten dollars cheaper and with a flanky weight system, what are the main differences between the two?
This is for sure the same mouse in a different body. The Perdition has the same weight system as well. If debating between the two mice I say it comes down to the cosmetics and the need for a thumb rest or not. Even the software for both mice are identical aside from the logo of course. I think I want them both, at such a low price point I don't see why not. What really gets me is this mouse info states it's been on Amazon since late 2013. Mind boggling as I've been looking for a true alternative to the G600 and Naga for such a long time now.
is the software user friendly?
It is easy to start up and easy to use to set up the keys. The starting keys itself is already fine meaning you don't need to set up all your mouse bindings if you don't mind a standard mouse set up with the side keys 1-12 being hotkeys for the 1-12 numbers of your keyboard and if you want to change any of the bindings an image on the in software key set up will show you what option corresponds to what on your mouse making it really straight forward. Its been a super easy time using it in general.
How easy is it to switch profiles? (And how quickly?) I sometimes have to switch strategies quickly, meaning a whole new set of macros. Thanks!
There is a quick button on the bottom of the mouse is cycles through the profiles in order. You can assign a color to each profile so you can easily see which one your on. You do have to pick it up to do it but I think you can also assign a button on the top of the mouse to switch profiles.
Which one of those is best for fps Gameing ? VENUS Or Uranus Or US-D8200-GM OR US-D4000-GM Please answer me ^_^
Venus
What is a good age for this game? Can younger kids play it?
I would say 7 and older they have to know the essentials of farming to understand the game though it's complexed like planting spraying and combining crops!

no they the cows mile themselfs. they walk through a automatic milking machine

How do you get the chicken eggs? I am trying to help my young son and I can't figure out how to get the eggs or how to pick up the hay to feed the cow
My son said , to pick up eggs just walk over them. Use a hay bailer and place in pasture or stalls to feed cows. Hope this helps
can you get fellow buchers for loging
Yes
Can I be a responsible/organic farmer &amp; win? Or I have to be bad by feeding cows with corn and cage chicken?
Your chickens are in one spot and you cannot change where or how they are kept. The cows are fed buy grass, straw and chaff that you collect and have to mix for the best feed. As far as organic farming, you either use fertilizers bought and filled on your farm or get it from raising cows. There are you two choices. This is a limited game.
is there multiplayer
No there is not
is there any kind of business sim involved, in terms of earning money-spending money, setting prices etc. ?
The only business involved is running your farm, improving with better equipment, keeping out of debt, there is not a way to set prices but there are demands for crops that pay higher prices during limited times.
where do you get seeds!
On your farm there is a place you pull up to on the left side where you can park your equipment under the long shed. You also can fill your fertilizers up on the right side of same shed. Hope that helps if not use the walk through section of the game and they show you how to do it.
whats so great about this game?
It is very realistic..and fun to play

Can I use the Sony PS3 Media/Blu-ray Disc Remote Control with this super slim model?

can I play my ps2 games on it?
This ps3 unfortunately does not have backwards compatibility for ps2. Ps1 games however work great still.
One review here mentions internet browsing. I realize this PS3 is not a computer per se, but can you surf the internet on it?
Yes you can surf the internet. It a little difficult because there is no keyboard tho I would recommend to buy one
Is this PS3 Console only a vertical stand or can it be horizontal stand?
It can rest horizontally.
Does the controller which come with the console have a bluetooth technology? or do I have to connect it using the USB cable? is the USB cable included
The controller uses built-in batteries that are charged via a USB-type chord to the machine. It blinks when the battery is low. I prefer it to the xbox controller and I have both.

Is this version contains World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade, The Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm ?
It now includes all the expansions except Warlords.
What does this come with? Is this the same as the digital download of WoW on Blizzard's website?
Yes, it's the same as the digital download on Blizzard's website except that it also comes with a nice starter's guide that details the classes and races and some basics of the game. It includes one free month of game time, as well as the first 3 expansions (Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm.) This bundle does not include the newest expansion Mists of Pandaria.
is this a good one to start with? i know nothing about this game except it looks like something i can play with my son.
This is the one that you have to start with. The rest of them are expansion packs you add to this original software. When I purchased this I thought I was getting the version in the picture (the newest release date version) but was sent the original box version. From my understanding there isn't much difference and I did make the company that ships this aware of it. Customer service was IMPECCABLE. They were very prompt and courteous in emails.
I am from another country and just need the game code, is this possible?
I recommend going to us.battle.net and making your purchase there for a good digital copy. I am not sure if the digital copy is available through amazon. I also did not look though.
I think this might be redunant, but does this include a free month of game time as well?
Yes it does.
Will this game work with Microsoft xbox 360 controller for windows
It has a Lot of commands and sub commands that xbox windows controller won't be enough'
Since this does not include Mists of Pandaria, will my Padaren I created on the trial version be deleted? Should I purchase that expansion with this?
In this case you should buy Mist of Pandarian as well. So the pandaren character would be included. Now since you played a trial I really don't know if your character will be deleted. I'm a new player on WOW and I was requested to create an original character from the initial game at lvl 50it will allow you to create other characters from the other expansions
If I buy this one, can I get the game key? or it's only the content of game?
You get the game, code and free game time
what OS doe is support
Windows,Mac,Linux
does it let you level boost a character automatically or do you have to grind to 90
you boost from 1 to 90 instantly, but professions aren't level to max unless you have your character over lvl 60.
Is this version contains World of Warcraft, The Burning Crusade, The Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm ?
It now includes all the expansions except Warlords.
What does this come with? Is this the same as the digital download of WoW on Blizzard's website?
Yes, it's the same as the digital download on Blizzard's website except that it also comes with a nice starter's guide that details the classes and races and some basics of the game. It includes one free month of game time, as well as the first 3 expansions (Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm.) This bundle does not include the newest expansion Mists of Pandaria.
is this a good one to start with? i know nothing about this game except it looks like something i can play with my son.
This is the one that you have to start with. The rest of them are expansion packs you add to this original software. When I purchased this I thought I was getting the version in the picture (the newest release date version) but was sent the original box version. From my understanding there isn't much difference and I did make the company that ships this aware of it. Customer service was IMPECCABLE. They were very prompt and courteous in emails.
I am from another country and just need the game code, is this possible?
I recommend going to us.battle.net and making your purchase there for a good digital copy. I am not sure if the digital copy is available through amazon. I also did not look though.
I think this might be redunant, but does this include a free month of game time as well?
Yes it does.
Will this game work with Microsoft xbox 360 controller for windows
It has a Lot of commands and sub commands that xbox windows controller won't be enough'
Since this does not include Mists of Pandaria, will my Padaren I created on the trial version be deleted? Should I purchase that expansion with this?
In this case you should buy Mist of Pandarian as well. So the pandaren character would be included. Now since you played a trial I really don't know if your character will be deleted. I'm a new player on WOW and I was requested to create an original character from the initial game at lvl 50it will allow you to create other characters from the other expansions
If I buy this one, can I get the game key? or it's only the content of game?
You get the game, code and free game time
what OS doe is support
Windows,Mac,Linux

Does this drive disable the disc drive so you cannot use original games?
Yes, it happend to me a couple weeks after I bought it. Also, I could not down load new updates.
How much space do you get totally?
My kids installed it, so I didn't get a chance to see the exact amount after format, but even with their profiles and some game stuff saved, I still thought I saw 58g free of the 60
I don't have the xbox 360 slim. Will this work on just the xbox 360?
This item is specifically for the SLIM because of its design. This drive inserts into the body of the slim through a door that opens on the end. It slides in and attaches and you shut the door back. This would not work on any other xbox.
hook this up via usb?
There is a small door on the side of the console that pops open. If you don't already have an internal hard drive it will be empty and this one just drops right in.
I need a hard drive for bf4 will this work just fine even if its not a microsoft hdd?
yes this will work fine
This item work with Xbox 360 E console
if that means the xbox slim than yes
Does this operate with PS3?
Hey, yes it does!
What system controller do these work with? My husband has an Xbox One and I am looking for this item for that system. He loves your products!
Hey, Our Xbox One Phantoms are only available through the KontrolFreek website at this time.
It is for xbox 360 rite
No
does it come with both grips or seprate
It comes with two grips for both analog sticks. Just like any other Kontrol freeks i personally use a cqc on the left analog since it is shorter
Is it good for quickscoping/trickshotting?
Yes it is. It gives you great aiming with sniping and any other weapon.
will these work on ps4 controllers?
No
will these work on a razer sabertooth Xbox 360 controller?
I'm pretty sure that they will work.
I bought these to use with my newly purchased wired 360 controller, but these won't even fit. Can I do anything aside from getting a refund?
They are a tight fit on my controller, but I did get them to fit. I have a Microsoft brand wired controller, along with 4 wireless controllers and they fit them all.
do they stick without the regular cover
Nope there Slick As hell Smooth movements/Aiming Worth the 15$ even without the regular Cover C:
can it be used for ps3
Of course, I use it on my ps3 and it really improve my accuracy. Once you get use to it you will think that the thumb stick are more shorter than before you use kontro freak
Does the 3ds XL play regular ds games as well--obviously without the 3d effect.
Yes it does!
Does this come with the ac adapter?
when bought brand new? Yes. if bought used, then it may or may not. But, the point is if it's brand new, then it should come with everything it's supposed to.
CAn you transfer the pre installed game to a bigger sd card?
Yes. Register the device with Nintendo. It can be transferred, from card to card, but I was unsuccessful. (even tried calling Nintendo support) Fortunately, once your device is registered, you can download the game for free from the eshop.
Does bundled 3DS come with dc charger, or does the dsi car charger fit the 3ds? thanks
Yes, it comes with its own charger, original for 3ds as any other bundle... About the dsi car charger I don't know if it works... You could try thou. Greetings
is the charger 240v
No. Just 110v
does it include a download code for pokemon X or Y as the second picture shows?
I don't know about all of them, but I do know that mine did NOT. Was a little disappointed by that, as I assumed by the photo your talking about that it would come with that download. My didn't though!
Is it touch screen display?
The bottom screen is touch-enabled, and generally it works really well, even without the stylus. A lot of 3DS games make use of the bottom screen in all sorts of novel ways, and some of that requires a finer point than just your finger can offer.
is this the same size as the DSi XL or is the screen on this bigger ?
The screen on the 3ds xl is supposed to bigger than the dsi xl screen.
Hello and place the order for my product, I wanted to ask, please wish my product is in its original box, I do not want another box for my other packa
Check to be sure the listing says New. If it's new & unopened you should receive it in it's original Nintendo packaging (factory sealed) with all the included accessories & manual. If it's new & unopened (factory sealed) it is Never Shrink-Wrapped. I know this to be a fact because I worked in the Nintendo (formerly Pokmon) store in NYC & all factory sealed boxes come with a special stickers on each end that when peeled open even gently it is obvious that it was unsealed to prevent tampering, etc. This is also true for all the other gaming consoles (XBox 360 XBox One, PS3 & PS4, Wii & Wii U, etc, even the old game systems & handhelds from years ago). All retail employees can tell if it was opened & will not take it back unless of course you are selling it back as used for way less even if it was just purchased 5mins prior. Good luck everyone.

Is Skylanders Dark Force game the same game as regular Swap Force? Is the game itself the same swap force game or is the dark force game different?
Same exact game. Different characters.
Can you buy the dark characters seperate from the starter pack? I have the Swap Force game and portal but want to buy the dark characters?
Yes however it may be cheaper to get a used set from starter pack rather than buy them a-la-carte!
I have Swap force already...do i need to buy the starter kit for dark edition game or do I just need the game??
Dark edition is a starter kit and comes with the base and game plus 5 dark edition skylanders.
Can you use the Dark characters on the regular, non-Dark Edition game?
Yes, I have the regular game and my brother has the Dark Edition and we have no problem using the characters with either game.
Hi. Can you ship to the UK? How soon and how much is shipping? Thanks
Sorry hut we are not shipping internationally at this time. IWD
can you use other swap force figures on the black portal
Yes. The portal and the game is the same as the regular swapforce.

I've never played Infamous 1 - Should you find a way to play it ( even if you don't own a PS3 ) before attempting Second Son?
It could help but it is not necessary. Entirely different story.
Does the Collector's Edition have spanish audio/subtitles?
I just checked and the game has options for both audio and subtitles but it seems like it's linked to your system setting so I had to change my entire system region over to Spanish but then it showed access to both the English and Spanish audio and subtitles.
What 's the shipping weight of two units?
About 5lb.
Does the game used $ 83 brings beanie of Delsin?
This edition Includes the beanie
"Pull the back bar down"? I'm reading the instructions and it says to pull the back bar down, is it supposed to require some force? It feels like I'm going to break it.
yeah, its take some force to adjust to fit your TV. i was scared at first but its a lot more durable then you think it it.
What's the privacy cover for?
So that if you wish for the camera on the kinect not be able to see you you can put it on. The camera is always on if the kinect is on and sees the whole room.
Is this something needed to go with an xbox 1? I'm gift shopping. And what is a kinect?
No, it isn't required. The Kinect sensor is bundled with most Xbox One consoles (it was required with mine but you can buy the console without the Kinect now). Research the Kinect. It's cool. I have young kids so I didn't want them to play with the Kinect so I bought this to mount it up high. The Kinect can sit by the TV but it looks like it belongs on top, with this bracket installed.
Will the mount scratch the front of your tv?
I have not removed the mount off of my television, but there is padding on the mount. I guess that should prevent any scratching on the front of the television.
My TV is curved and is mounted about 8' off of the ground. Are you able to adjust the direction the Kinect points while on the stand?
Curve shouldn't be a problem. The kinect can be tilted up and down there is a hinge
I have a tv mounted above my fireplace. Is 7' off the ground too high for this sensor to be placed?
You can point the mount down if the kinect is not catching everything. You should be ok
Will this mount work fo rthe LG 42LB5800 TV? It looks like there isnt much of a bevel on the TV for the stand to connect too.
Yes. It has a stand that you have to be very gentle pulling it out. Once you pull it out put on your TV and adjust it.
My TV is on a swivel arm mount because I move the TV around a lot. Is the mount sturdy enough to hold the camera while I move the TV around?
No
Will this fit on a Seiki SE24FE01-W 24-Inch Tv heres the link for pics http://www.amazon.com/Seiki-SE24FE01-...
Yes most definitely i have mine set ontop of a 24 inch monitor. the only question is if it can hold the weightof thekinect wihtout tipping over your monitor. Mine can, howevr i do not now how much yours can hold. the mount is super light so really just take into consideration the weight of the kinnect and make your decision from there.
Is the angle of the camera adjustable? Can I adjust it took look lower or higher as I desire? (Use Xbox fitness a lot and need it to see floor level.
The mount is only adjustable to make it sit on the TV properly. Once the Kinect is mounted, you can still tilt the sensor as you normally would, but your view range is dependent on the distance. I got the mount because my living room is smaller and putting it on my TV allowed it to see more of the room. Once you move it, you can recalibrate the sensor to the new position through the Kinect settings. In this sense it worked for me, but it depends on your set up. Does this help?

These are add on pieces. In order to play you need the starter pack which includes three characters, game and activation base. These work for every game system that you have the base and game for.
Will this Infinity Bundle work with the Infinity 2.0 that comes w/ the super heros?
While the characters work in the "toy box" portion of the game, you can not use the levels in 1. you need to keep 1.0 to play the original games.
Will this hard drive work to play original games on my XBOX 360 Slim?
I got it for new battlefield as it needed hard drive (I have Xbox 360 with 4gigs). Worked good, it extends your memory so I don't see a reason why it wouldn't work with original games
does it work for titanfalls
It's for a system not a game
is it an external hard drive
Basically, yes, it is inserted in the top of the Xbox when you remove the slats. This one is for Xbox 360 slim.

in the wii u can i play with that games of the wii and gamecube like in the wii?
You can play Wii games on it but not Gamecube games!
Does the console play DVD's?
No, it does not play DVD or Blu-Ray movies, nor does it play audio CD's. It will only run Wii U and Wii software (including titles downloaded from eShop and virtual console).
Does it come with a hard copy of the games or download codes? I was looking to get the used version but do not want to risk getting a used code
hard copy, one disk of both games.
Are the games Physical or Digital?
Both games are on one disc. http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/QzGKZgfv5oFkGY0J9CZ3hgnyOwH4KBqo
What is its storage size?
32GB
If I paid to download old games on my Wii, can I download them again on the WiiU for free?
You can tranfer all of your old downloaded games from your wii to your wiiu as long as you have an SD card (this will also wipe everything off your wii). The wiiu has a "wii mode" that just looks like the old wii home screen, from there you can play your transferred games and old wii game disks.
does this come with a wii also as one is pictured on the box? that is the only reason i ask. im sure not but just checking.
That is not a Wii console (last generation) that is the Wii U console (current generation). The Controller is the pad on the left in the picture with the Wii U logo on the screen. So just to be clear this does not include a Wii this is a new console called the Wii U. It will play Wii games, but will not play the Gamecube games like the Wii was able to do.
How many can play on this at one time? Also, what other devices do I need for the extra kids to play?
5 people can play at a time (depending on the game). That requires purchasing 4 more controllers or using old Wii controllers. Most people seem to prefer the Pro controllers to the Wiimote. A lot also love the included gamepad, but only 1 of those is supported.
Does this bundle have the new high capacity GamePad battery that lasts up to 8 hours? Or, is it still the original one that one lasts 3 to 5 hours?
To be honest I don't know I don't play that long. I bought the nyko pro controller and I could always use that if the game pad ran out. It's a great controller and 20 bucks
Will this work on a US vita? Or does it have to be a Japan vita?
This version of j stars victory vs is region free meaning it works on the US vitas as well as Japan vitas
does it have english subtitle? can i play online if im in the US
It doesn't have english subtitles I've found but you can find translations of menus online Easily. I've tried to connect to online and it has not proved feasible. Maybe you can find a way. There are many configurations and every time I get to the competitor confirmation screen, it takes me back to the previous screens so I suppose that is a decline.

Yes he is
Is there an english version?
Nop

How is this mouse with fingertip grip users?
I'm not a sophisticated gaming user, but I have a fingertip grip and it works OK for me. Note that the side buttons (on the left side of the mouse) are probably better placed for a palm grip. As with any mouse, you're best off trying it in a store before buying if at all possible.
How is this mouse for Claw Grip?
if you have hands bigger than 7 inches, go for it.

Does the scroll wheel click when you scroll it or is it smooth?
It's a clicker, but it's a very loose click. There are gradations in the wheel, but it's still very easy to scroll with little actual force.
Can the button for the CPI toggle be remapped to be held down? Like as a PTT for Ventrilo?
It can be remapped, but you can't map it to be a continuous hold. It can be mapped to a one-off macro of keystrokes in the driver. Could be used as a toggle for voice activation or microphone mute, but not the traditional PTT.

I have about 700 hours in CS:GO, I have this and the Steelseries XXL mousepad I think it's called, tracking is absolutely perfect though the mouse is a tad bit on the large+heavy side. I'm 5'6" and have medium hands if you were curious.

No. Only online co-op.
I am a real novice. What is a steam account?
A steam account, is an account on this page http://store.steampowered.com/. You can download a software there that allows you to install games to your computer and play them from this software platform. Games from steam usually come at great discounts. Imagine downloading a playstation interface to your computer. It's like having a playstation account. Instead it's from a provider called Steam, and thus it is a Steam Account.
Does it work for Windows 8.1 ?
yes it does - have fun!
Can I play this game Offline?
Yes, once you already downloaded it, the game as well as your saves, are saved onto your hard drive. So you can definitely play it offline.
Can it be played on Windows 8.1?
should work. just make sure you have a good virus program. this hit me pretty good. but needs to be fixed asap. everything is fine...
is outlast worth getting???
No. It's boring and annoying. What could have been a fun and immersive experience is bogged down by necessary game scenarios (hit three switches) and after the monster finds you and kills you a few times, the game turns from scary to annoying and frustrating. The fact that you have no weapons to fend yourself off makes things scary at first, but eventually becomes just lame because only being able to run pads out the game since you have to retrace your steps again once a chase is over. It wasn't fun at all and I never finished it.
I have a Satellite connection - 20 GB a month. If I buy a games (CD not Steam), can I play withouth having the Steam take away ALL of my monthly GB?
No, this game only comes as a downloadable title, so you would lose a big part of your monthly allowance simply by downloading it.
Is it a steam code or another DRM?
Its a steam code. You purchase it here on amazon, go figure lol. But this game though lol. This game i dont recommend for the faint hearted.
can you use your xbox controller???
I don't know I just used a mouse but don't see why not that's just my opinion though. Hope this helps
Is Whistleblower included in this or do you have to buy that seperately?
No. You HAVE to buy it separately.
Does the PC version of the game support manual saves or is it checkpoint only?
You can click to save, but I don't believe it will save it right there, I do believe it will just return you to the checkpoint. I could be wrong though, I usually just use the checkpoints haha

hey guys does this fit the newer model vita? i have that one and im having trouble finding good accessories
Yes this fits the new one
How long did it take yours to fully charge the first time? Mine's been plugged in for six hours and the light's still red...
Mine took around 8 hours to charge.
Is it feasible to just charge both with this attached? I know you probably can but I wasn't sure which would be faster. (vs charging separately)
Yes when attached it charges the PS Vita first then the Battery in the Grip. It is advised to power the PS Vita off if you want it to fully charge.
High pitched buzzing noise as soon as the Vita begins to draw energy, am I the only one experiencing this?
I have not noticed this at all. Maybe your unit is defective?
I own this and love it, but is there a carrying case that will fit this snugly all together?
Yes! AmazonBasics case, have it myself and it fits perfect. Even room for the some extras, like headphones, a cleaning cloth and some games or SD cards. Some nice pockets inside to store them in. Link to item:
Does the grip have a toggle to turn on and off the ability to charge so that the grip isn't always charging the vita?
No. You have to remove the Vita or wait for the battery to run down on the grip.
How many mAh does the battery hold? (milliamps)
2800mAh Vita battery : 2200mAh It quite good grip, perfect fit in the hand, but durability is really awful
I don't know if the post is old (pre- PCH-2001 Model).... would this work with my PCH-2001 model? Thanks!
It is made for the 2000 model. I've been using it and its absolutely perfect! great grip! only gripe would be getting accustomed to hitting R2 and L2 on the back panel. Before I was always hitting it by accident, which doesnt happen now with the power grip. But now the R2 is a bit harder to reach. For example, I cant have my finger ready at R1 and hit R2 at the same time. I run into this problem when playing borderlands.
Do you still have access to the memory card and game card slots without taking off the grip?
Memory card yes, game slot no.
is this like an extra battery in the grip itself. also what charger it takes. the 1st gen vita or 2nd gen vita charger. thanks if you reply
Yes it's a battery pack 2extra hrs of play, and 2gen vita

Is it different enough from ALTTP to where I won't feel deja vu?
definitely. the only real things that may feel the same is the overworld map being almost identical in a lot of areas and the overall playability. which isnt a bad thing. its very smooth and fun to play. the dungeons are all different. a lot of cool new puzzles and weapons etc. i think you'd have a lot of fun with this if you're a fan of the original.
what is the age cut off? My son is 5 &amp; really wants a Zelda game. I jus want to make sure he is able to play the game on his own &amp; not having to watch dad play it to enjoy it.
The game is for everyone.
Which languages does it have? Is Spanish included?
I don't believe so. Sorry.
Does this game work with Nintendo DS? Or is 3DS required??? buying for gift, not familiar with game systems . . .
You need a 3DS to play it
I want to buy this game but it says 3Ds, is it eligible with a regular DS or just 3Ds
Nope. You need a 3ds
How would I delete 1 save file without wiping the whole cartridge?
Just go back into that save file play some and save then it will be your new save for that file. That is the only way I know how.
I have a Europe Nintendo 3ds, does this game run in my console?
Nintendo games are region locked, so I'd lean toward "not compatible." I'm not sure exactly where you look for definitive proof though.
Does this game have co-op play option?
No.
can link be controlled useing the d pad or just the circle pad
He can only be controlled with the circle pad
does thiws game work for the 3ds xl model?
Yes. All 3ds games are compatible with the 3ds xl and 2ds models.
I know the games come as their own discs, but can you tell me is the online code inside the paper case packaging or is it found in the manual/paperwork?
Sorry, but in my case, the disc doesn't came with the console. Really shame. Amazon must be send me this game.

Yes
the last of us with this PS3 250GB is in spanish language too?
Si viene en espaol e ingles
Does this require an HDTV, or can you use an old RCA connector?

No.

Our Wii just died on us &amp; we have a lot of games for it. Are the Wii games compatible with the Wii U console?
Yes of course. I cant remember any wii games cant play on wiiu, Btw get mario kart bundle better
How many GB capacity has this?
This is the 8GB set. You may want to have an HDD or flash drive if you buy the 8GB set. Space gets eaten up VERY quickly. After the installation of the huge update you're left with a little over 2GB
can i use a Sd card for the 8 basic set?
Hi, yes you can. I'm using a SD card on my Wii U and it works fine.
Can you play movies on the wii u console?
The Wii U has all the major streaming services, but it can't play any discs.
How much space does does regular and super nintendo games use and how many could I download on the 2 gigs ?
With the basic set your 2gb has to cover game saves for wii u games and downloads However the easy solution is get a usb 3.0 powered hdd from amazon and exponecolly expand your very limited storage with a 2-3 TB hdd you can even dl full games from e-shop want smash faster dl it the day of release. Best advice get a external powered hdd.
Can one person play one game on the game pad and someone else be able to play a different game on the wii u console
One person can play a game on the game pad and the other person can only watch actual TV program.
can you tell me Max of Flash Memory Cards .tks
I believe the stated maximum is 32GB, but I would expect that it would support twice that (as many devices do). If you're you're considering using a large flash memory card as game storage ... commercial flash memory has a limit on the number of times you can write over it is not recommended as devices for long-term storage of downloaded games or save data. You can get an inexpensive external hard disk drive for around the same $30/$40 as many large capacity SD cards. An 80Gb or 160 Gb drive can be purchased for under $30.
how many GB IT HAS??
The system has 8.

Yes, with the season pass you have the access to skill bundles too.
What is a Season Pass?
Depending on the game, it can be added content on top of the regular game. There called DLC's or downloadable content. New missions, maps etc.

Although, some people have uploaded rosters with them on it that are free to download
Does this game require an ONLINE PASS in order to play online??
I am not sure on this particular game as I have not played online yet. I did download a roster that I liked better than what the game had, but usually they give you a code that works or the playstation store has a free one. When I went into the online screen on accident it acessed it and did not mention anything about needing an online pass.
I bought this game, and comes without a Game Manual, is this normal?
Yes
I'm from NY so I'm very interested in what the Yankee roster is before i buy this.....do they have any of the new players like Tanaka, Ellsbury,etc?
Yes, the roster it's updated every week
The Franchise mode in The Show 13 had players age too quickly, and pretty much drop off a cliff after 35. Is this year's game any different? I shouldn't find Clayton Kershaw in AA (making $24MM) in 2022.
Players regularly retire, however it is the players that would expect, i.e. late thirties, lack of ability, etc. In RTTS I have noticed that the AI makes what I can only call, ridiculous trades. You'll see your stars get traded away early in the season for scrubs, or minor league "talent." In RTTS you will see some player retire earlier than expected. The unrealistic trade logic does impact franchise mode as well. Since Kershaw is under 35 I would presume that he would be good for quite a few years. I caution you in purchasing this game. If you can get a good deal on the cost, go for it, otherwise be warned as the AI is terrible in this game. The fielding mechanics are not what they were in previous MLB games and lead to a lot of frustration. The other major glaring issues in this game is that you will be picked off at will by the AI, your pickoff attempts WILL go into the stands at least once a game, and the online portion of this game has not worked since the game was released.
Does this game support move controllers also...???
Yes
I have a sealed copy of MLB 13 sitting next to me. Is it worth upgrading to MLB 14? I can't afford a PS4 now, so the PS3 version is my only option.
I myself could not afford ps4 but bought mlb 14 for ps3. So far online play was extremely bad. Very choppy online play. Issues with responsiveness and graphics issues. If I knew that I would have just kept playing mlb13 and then upgrade to ps4 next year after the bugs are out.
any that are not blue ray?
no but what would you want no blu ray, the console plays blu ray
are the graphics good for ps vita?
yes theyare good
are the cooperstown all time greats included ?

We have a Windows 8 machine-will this work on it?
Yes, this works on Windows 8 (and 8.1).
Can u use on multiple computers? Ex..if I buy..can I play on laptop one day and desktop the next? Ty.
Yes, you should be able to do so. I haven't tried it, but the point of a cloud based game is that you can play anywhere. It may get a bit more complicated if you want to play the same offline city on both though.
Can you change the language on this game? Like to French for example?
You can change the language. I believe you can select your language when you install it.
does this include the main game plus the expansion or just the expansion???
This includes both the main game and the expansion.
Does this game have multiplayer mode? My son and I would like to play together on the Internet and/or within our home LAN.
Yes. The game has two modes. A Single Player mode and Multiplayer mode. Multiplayer requires an Internet connection. You will NOT be able to play multiplayer mode on LAN. The multiplayer mode requires an internet connection with an Origin account, while Simcity is updated to the latest version. In Multiplayer mode, you can create a game or even join other games. A game refers to a region where you have multiple cities. You could invite friends and your son to play in the same region. Since you want to play a multiplayer game with your son, I am assuming you would be purchasing the game once. The game purchase can only be registered with a single Origin account. A single Origin game account allows you to install the game on multiple PCs with the same account. This would technically allow your son and yourself to play the game with this account on different PC's. However, a single account can only be logged in once. Meaning, both of you cant play at the same time. So in order to play the game at the same time, you would need to purchase the game twice, have two separate Origin accounts, one for yourself and your son. This would allow multiplayer at the same time. The other mode is the single player mode. This mode does not require a persistent Internet connection to play. The game data will be stored on your PC rather than on Servers. For the single player mode, you can play the game even though your Orgin account is in offline mode. I am assuming this may allow you and your son to play a single player game without internet on two different PCs at the same time as long as the origin account is set to offline mode on both the PCs. I could be wrong though. Hope This answer helped.

This is only the code? Where do i download the game from after buying the code?
Install Steam and activate the game within steam. Download the steam client here: store.steampowered.com
do i need game controller to play or can i use a keyboard
You can use your keyboard. I use it too, but it's not comfortable. When you want to do a bigger combo, it is impossibble to make it succesfull. So I recommend controller to play.
Can you play this game without being online?
Ofcourse you can
How do I get the game to recognize and allow the use of a xbox 360 game controller?
I have a wired xbox 360 game controller, I just plugged it in the USB port of my computer and the game automatically recognized it. It also asks you when you about to play a match to Press the Accept Button on the controller you want to use, so I've had no problems using the xbox 360 controller for this game. Not sure how a wireless controller would work.
Does this game have multiplayer mode?
Yes it does through steam. It has same screen multi-player but No LAN support though...
Does the audio work?
YEP as long as your normal audio works This should work As always get the latest drivers for your audio card Check settings in game
Does the Ultimate Edition have the WBID unlockables?

Do you get separate Steam keys for each game?
Yes!
Will Sonic &amp; All Stars Racing Transformed key work on a Mac or do I need to buy a Mac version of the game?
They redeem on steam, which does not carry mac versions of the sonic games. You can see the list here, listing only windows as supported. http://store.steampowered.com/sub/26498/
If I have a US Billing address, but am currently based overseas, can will the download code work on my overseas Steam account?
Yes
Is there gamepad support?
I haven't played every game but I know that adventure 1 & 2 , generations, and both racing games support gamepads
it doesn't say windows 8.1 compatible but if it's all steam based doesn't it only matter on what OS you can run steam on?
Not necessarily. I can run Steam on my pc, but not COD: Ghosts because my Windows version is not 64-bits. That being said, I have the pack and all the games run fine on my Windows 7 PC, I don't believe you will have an issue.
Do you need wifi to play? I know you need it to download... But is it needed to actually play the games?
The pack is played through steam so you'll need to have an account with them first before downloading the game. All of this requires an internet connection but to actually play the games there should be an offline mode in steam's settings.
Do you get separate Steam keys for each game?

Is Phantom Pain included? What does unlock bonus MGS V Phantom Pain with Ground Zeroes means?
Nope. Phantom Pain is not out yet. The bonus in this game is a Phantom Pain's trailer only.
You can change the language to Spanish? or put subtitles?
Yes
Is this entire game just one level?!!!!!
Yes but its just lime a preview to MGS5 Phantom pain .... This game will take you days to get 100% on its stealth game and yeah JTS one island you on there a lot to do .. Just.got to look for and be a fan of MGS
did this come with a bonus for phatom pain?
It is only a demo, it's not the full game
please can anyone tell me if this is a blue ray CD or PSN code?
blu-ray disc, dude! :)
I heard there was a dog and the dog would allow you to throw it like a fighting star?
No. And for future reference, avoid trolling on this site, and actually ask some questions that need to be answered.
What is the game reagone 1 or 2 ?
Reagone?
Bought this game as a gift for someone. Now I'm told that a hard drive is needed to play the game? Is this so? What type of hard drive is needed?
All xbox 360s are supposed to have a hard drive . Some Units require a slim hard drive or up to a 250 that snaps in place on the top of the xbox . You need to figure out which type you need . If its the older style 360 2nd hand drives are available cheap if you look . Make sure its a OEM hard drive not a fake from china. In the mean time you can maybe hook up a large thumb drive like 32gb or 64 and could play some games till you get the right drive . I would suggest the 250 GB cause the space goes fast and is used for other things like demos , videos etc. I hope this helps. Ash
Does the game still come with the konami core code in the pamphlet?
yup
Does this game still come with the code for unlocks when TPP comes out? Does the One version?
No apparently it won't for any format (one PS4 included) it won't - however; it will probably come Later as an extra included with some GOTY if the T.P.P. game goes there (?) - unless the ground Zero "demo" won't come at all , and it will turn into some expensive source of income for fans & collectors and speculator via e-bay and amazon sellers . The all point of it is that it was an overpriced game-play demo specifically made for the hype of T.P.P. and Kojioma (The king of the "Hideo cames") just showed that supporting him and his talent does not come for free. A bit like if Spielberg made us pay to see the trailer of his next movie. I conclude Video games industry even in Japan is rotten through the bones.
Does anyone know if the Full version will be available for Xbox 360?
Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain is expected to come out early 2015, although some sources say the first release will be Dec 31, 2014. Phantom Pain will be released early 2015 for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3 and PS4.
if I have widows 8 will it still work?
Yes. I have win 8 64 bit and it works fine.
does it need java?
Robert, that's an interesting question. I have always had Java installed in all my systems, and graphical things seemed to work better than not. I have never explored this game specifically to see if it plays better without Java, but it seems to play great with my existing profile. I don't experience the types and number of glitches that most forums are reporting. I hope this helps you.
What is actually the difference between gold steam and standard steam for PC download? Thank you.
I think the gold has all the dlc
Is it compatible with windows 7?
Should be. I run it on Windows 8.1 with no problems, and 8.1 has more issues with gaming than 7 did in my experience.
has anyone else had there pc completely shut down while playing assissins creed 4? mine does after about 25min. it has happened 5 times so far.
that's typically an issue of your power supply either failing or not supplying adequate power.
hey does anybody know how to replay a video scene that was accidently skipped?
As far as I know, you'd have to just replay the memory sequence through the progress tracker.
can i download it again if i erase it
Yes because it will be stored into your steam account. If you do not have a steam account you need it to download the game
if I have widows 8 will it still work?
Yes. I have win 8 64 bit and it works fine.

Can this connect to more than one device at a time? ie Multipoint
No, Pure1 connects with ONE device at a time. But you can switch between different devices. I alwasy switch between my cell phone and tablet. When driving, i connect it with my cell phone. At home, i connect it with my tablet.
Is this compatible with a the PS3?
If the PS3 has bluetooth function, it can. Just check the PS3 manual or bluetooth icon/logo on the device.
Any one know what version of Bluetooth it is, (ie: 1.2 , 2, 3 or 4?)
I d'ont know!!
Is this compatible with a the PS4?
Yes
Any PDF of Manual for this device?
No, only a small guide in hard copy.
Does it announce the phone number on incoming calls?
yes
How does it recharge?
Through micro usb port on the headset
Does it work with any smart phone?
I believe it does. I actually bought it for my husband to use with his iphone but it should be compatible with any phone that has bluetooth capabilities.
How can I tell if this is on or off without physically trying to make a call?
very good
I have a Panda Plug and play 4.0 Bluetooth USB adapter in my computer. Does this thing do skype and Livestreams on comps? I look goofy in headphones.
Yes, first you need to plug the bluetooth adapter and make your computer be bluetooth enable. Then you can connect this Pure1 headphone with your computer by Bluetooth tech.
I know the your PS3 character level and whatnot can transfer from PS3 to PS4 but does your loot that your character has on transfer to or do you start from square one??? they had already released that your character can transfer but what is the extent...
Your character's levels, gear, vendors and stash are all saved together. When you transfer to PS4, all of that will be transfered.
Release date?
Now confirmed for August 19th. http://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-3-ultimate-evil-edition-confirmed-for-both-xbox-one-and-ps4-coming-this-august/1100-6419572/
Is there a monthly fee?
No
Is it split-screen multiplayer? Online multiplayer? Or is it multiplayer at all?
all the above
can u play two players at same house ? likd me and my nephe play sam time nex toeach other on sam tv sam ps4 ?
Yes you can
What is transmorgification? The amazon preorder bonus mentions an item ready for that.
Transmog is making one piece of gear look like another. That way you can equip the stuff you need and if you don't like the way it looks, you can change it.
I've heard that you have to be online all the time with this game or need to check in regularly and it can't be played offline, any truth to this?
On the PC version, yes, you need to be online. On the console versions, you do not.
Does this require a monthly subscription?
No
This is the complete game with all dlc correct? It does not require any other purchases?
For all 4 versions, the Description states: This Ultimate Evil Edition contains both Diablo III and the Reaper of Souls expansion set, together in one definitive volume. There is other DLC available, but it is not required in order to play.
Will I be able to continuing playing with my PS3 friends online and, for that matter, friends who don't have the Ultimate Evil version?
I believe that you and your online friends will need the same version of the game and the same console to play together. PS3 and PS4 players will not be able to play together.
Does controller support siaxis?
Yes it does but they have an automatic timer on how long it can go unused like sitting it to the side to go to the bathroom or the kitchen for something it shuts the controller off but this is good because the battery time is amazing if you charge it right like I have but yes sixaxis is supported you bought a great controller
Can this controller play ps2 games on ps3 like Duel Shock 3? I recently bought a USB third party controlle but wasn't compatible with ps2 games on ps3
Yes
I am having trouble connecting. I followed the short instructions in the package but cannot get controller to charge or connect.
There is a small hole in the back ....have u tried to reset the control??
will this device connect to a charging dock without any issues?
Yes, connects without problems . It's really easy
does it works wired or wireless with a normal pc ?
Hi there, The item you are referring to is a wireless Bluetooth controller. Hope that helps! Thank you, Rebecca SlickBlue
can this work as a bluetooth controller for a mac?
Hi there, This item is only compatible with a Sony PS3, it will not work with a MacBook. Thank you!
I am Nigerian but I am buying my PS4 from the US. Will this Membership Card be useful to me? I know a whole lot of people who play online here in Nigeria but I want to be sure how to go about it. Thanks.
Yes it is useful. But you have to create a psn account from usa.
I wanted to know if you can send me the code to my email because I would need to use it as soon as possible. Thanks.
You could have gotten the option to get it online, this one actually comes to your house.
how i exchenge de code? do i recive a e-mail or i have to wait de card arrive my contry?
You wait for the card to arrive.
expiration date?
The expiration date is 1 year from the date you register.
this code works for ps4 to or onlyy for ps3 and how do you send the code?
Works on anything. They send the code I think in the mail and you redeem on the playstation store
is this work with middle east account (emirates account)?
No. Just works with us accounts! You need to create one!
These memberships works for just one account? Or multiple accounts in the same console? Thanks
It works just for one account...
I was told that the membership works for just one account in the ps4, is it true? Or it works for 2 or more accounts in the same console?
I don't own as PlayStation 4 but the discount and the PlayStation Plus membership do work on one account. But any game that you would download for free via Playstation Plus, you can still play those games on a different account as long as they're on your PS of course.
could help me please my question is how I sent the code is by email or serious
they sent me an actual card

Where is Conception 1?
It was a PSP game that never got localized, but far as I know there are independent stories so we're free to buy this one without any problem.
How likely is this game to be sold out/out of stock if I want to pre-order it later since I still want to be able to get the pre-order bonus?
I don't think this is kind of game that will have a ton of pre-orders, except for people that really have researched or know the game. It is one of those games that will probably be hard to find a physical copy after it's been released because it won't really be re-stocked. It'll be one of those games that about a month or two after it comes out, will probably have a jacked up price on Amazon , available on the e-shop and not on store shelves. But if you're planning to pre-order in say March/Early April it should be fine.
Is there gonna be a collectors edition?
The pre-order bonus offer IS the Collector's Edition if I'm not wrong. It comes in a special box along with the sound track CD. http://www.siliconera.com/2013/12/17/conception-ii-collectors-edition-announced-nintendo-3ds-vita/
Hey im thinking of buying this game but im a little worried to. is the main story long and is there alot of extra stuff to do after the story?
depends. it advises you can take as much time as you want. so you can go through as fast or as slow as possible and there is multiple endings so it does have a good replay ability.
What is this game like. There is near no footage of it anywhere, I saw some japaneese footage and was confused. Does anyone know what it plays like
If you type in Conception 2 Vita on Youtube there's 7 pages of videos of it.
Will I have the liberty to choose the dub in japanese/english?
I don't recall the demo offering that. If there is a lot of dialog then there is just going to be English. You can turn off voices anyway and just read the text.
Does this game include a PIN code?
Yes, it does
Can I import this game ? I want this OST Sample so much, but I live in europe and as I heard there will be only a digital download version
All 3ds games are region locked, so unless you have a north american 3ds, you won't be able to play it if you import it to europe.
If I preorder through Amazon will I receive the preorder version? I want to be absolute certain
The first print run is the collector's edition as is typical with Atlus games.
Does Conception II Children of the Seven Stars have turn based battles like dragon quest or bravely default?
Yes, it is turn based. Turn order is affected by level and stats.
I'm currently stationed in Japan right now but I have an account registered in the NA region. Would I be able to use this to add days to my account?
I am also in Japan, playing on a NA account, and it has been difficult trying to renew my subscription over here. Mogstation won't accept my Visa, presumably because it now recognizes it's not in the same country as the billing address. I can confirm that these cards do work for people in our situations - you'll enter it into the MogStation website. I've seen FF14 cards in the convenience stores over here - make sure you don't use these, because they won't work with a NA account. And for anyone else curious, there is surprisingly no extra lag or noticeable difference in gameplay when playing here. I've only noticed somewhat longer loading times.
If I use a 60 Day Time Card, does it countdown based on my time played or just 60 consecutive calendar days?
60 consecutive days
if i baught this for friend in Canada(BC) would it work? i tried a psn points card once didnt work cuz of currency issues
yes it would. the lodestone ( ffxiv service page) will allow you to load service via a game time card to add service.
What exactly is this item and how does one use it? btw: I have the ps/3 trial installed but expired
You use this game time card to renew your monthly subscription for 60 days
do u need it if u buy the ps3game
It's a game time card for the whole service. Doesn't matter what you play the game on. You could also go to the moghouse and pay for time there. The mog house is where you access your ffxiv account.
why are they charging 30$ for something that would cost 26$ at most? if you pay with a credit card 30 days its 12.95$ so why? pay more?
$12.99 for one character. As soon as you add another character, it goes up to $ 14.99/mo., but you can have up to 8 characters. This card operates the same way. It's $15/mo., because you can have up to 8 characters instead of just the 1 you with the $12.99/mo sub fee.
Do I need to have the correct billing information or an address in my Square Enix account to be able to use this?
No just log into your square enix account and put the code on the card in at the mog station redeem code tab and that's it.
Does this time card add "Crysta" points, since Ultimate Game Card is already voided. Just wondering because I plan to world transfer.
It's only adds game play time not Crysta
Is pc game time and ps4 game time on the same account?
Yes, you can have the same account with the two platforms- time would be shared.
I'm new to this. I've never heard of a time card. Can someone explain what it is please?
Time cards can be use to play ff14 online. The game requires a free to play. Use time cards instead of credit card

Does this come with a rechargeable battery pack? and can it be used on the nyko charger base
It does not come with one. There are special controller bundles that come with rechargeable packs. Otherwise you would need to buy a separate rechargeable battery pack for it.
Does this come as shown in the picture without packaging or is it factory sealed?
The one I bought came factory sealed.
will it work for pc if you already have the usb connector?
Yes, I'm using this with my Windows 8 rig and the wireless adapter/receiver, works flawlessly. There is little to zero lag between controller input and what happens on screen.
is it good?
Yes, it works just as well as any other new genuine Xbox 360 controller and the blue chrome gives it a cool appearance.
Hi. Where can I see the system requirements for this game ?? Like processor, GPU and etc.?
All of the systemrequirements are listed on the game box.
will this run on windows 8?
Yes, it will run on Windows 8. To get Blitzkrieg 1 and its expansion packs running, all you have to do is go to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Blitzkrieg Anthology\". Then, go to the folder called "Blitzkrieg I", and then go to the "Run" folder. Then, look for the application known as "game.exe", and then right click on it. After that, go to the Compatibility tab and click on the check box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)." Then, click on the check boxes for "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings" and "Run this program as an administrator." Then, go to the "Blitzkrieg I Burning Horizon - Rolling Thunder" folder, and go to the "Run" folder, and look for the "game.exe" application, and do the same thing. Now, Blitzkrieg 2 and its expansion packs may work without any changes, but just in case, go to the "Blitzkrieg 2" folder, and go to the "bin" folder. Then, right-click on "Game.exe," and go to the Compatibility tab. After that, click on the check boxes for click on the check box for "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" and select "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)." Then, click on the check box for "Run this program as an administrator." That's all. Thank you for your time.
Does this game require online subscription?
No, online subscription isn't required or to my knowledge even available.
is this game compatible with windows 8.1 ?
Yes. However it does hang on my 8.1 pc from time to time but they may be the video card overheating. I have a basic laptop. Not a gaming laptop
When you got this did it come with 2 CD's?? Mine only has 1.
Only one dvd and it has 5 different games on it. It has 1 and 2 plus the expansions to them. Lots of hours and fun. I am glad that I bought this. Good luck to you.
How does it compare with the old Panzer General?
Game wise.i didnt like the game at all..I play the game for 5 second and turn it off.more like a kids game..david.new Zealand.
Does this game have starforce?
I have this game, How would I know if Starforce is on the game.
I see some reviewers complain that the game does not work with Windows 7. I have Win 7 32 bit version. Will it work?
I have Windows 7 Professional on my laptop. The processor is an Intel core 15 and the game runs but sometime it takes a while to being each new game. Not a computer expert here but hope this helps
This item includes Spanish language?
As far as I can tell it seems to be English only. I checked the options section and there are no buttons to change language settings. Maybe the developer might have info I could not find. Hope this helps.
Do each of these games have single player options? I ask because IE 5 is required to play each of them?
Yes they do, and they are good!
Does this come with a sleeve or case to keep the 2ds in?
No but they're pretty cheap on Amazon
How long is the battery life?
Well, unfortunately I'm not an avid gamer so I am not on it that often, but I have found that if you have it in sleep mode it does a very good job of retaining power. If I were to estimate, if you played it as much as the average owner, I would say you could get a guaranteed couple days out of it...I might even venture and say three days. Again thats just a guess. You might wanna poke around online and google some sites that will give you some good insight on the battery life. Hope I was able to help at least a little. Have fun and keep gaming! ;)
I bought one a while ago for my brother and it didn't come with a charger. I'm assuming that this one does, correct?
This 2DS comes with a grey wall charger, stylus, directions and a preloaded game. Basically everything you need to start playing right out of the box.
Does this really come with Pokemon X?
Yes it does. When you turn on the DS and scroll through the apps Pokemon X will appear.
Is this the NTSC version? I want to buy one region locked to the states.
I believe so.
Does it have pokemon on the console or is the ds plain red?
Its plain Red... no Pokemon emblems. The game is just installed in the system memory
if 2ds is broke do u lose preloaded game forever
I didn't lose my preloaded data when I sent mine in for repairs.
Is this Windows XP compatible? I didnt see it on the description.
The box says Windows 8.1 / 8 / 7 / vista / XP Pentium 4 or faster processor 2gb free disk space 1gb ram DVD optical drive Hope that helps.
Is this compatible with Mac?
I checked the back of the package and it states: Mac OS x 10.9, 10.8, 10.7, 10.6 2 GB free disk space, DVD optical drive. Hope this helps.
Is the a Candy Bars Patch?I cannot install cd??Computer just wont open the disc????
Installed with no problem or issues. Maybe the one you have is defective?
so to use the codes you go to the playstation store?
Yes you do. There should be an option on your Playstation menu specifically for redeeming codes under the Playstation store column. It's actually a lot easier than you'd think it would be, and these expansions are entirely worth it :)
How would this work if buying as a gift?
I gifted to hubby. You will get an email with a set of codes for each expansion. I believe hubby went to play station store and had an option to redeem codes. You will get instructions on redeeming with your email. If you wanna package it cute, u can always write the codes down on a nice card :) I was too impatient lol just gave him the code off my phone.
I have an India PSN account. Will these codes work with it or will it have a region conflict?
If your original game is a US version, then you can just make a US account on your PS and download. If your original game was Indian, then it won't work. (Source: I bought it for use with Skyrim bought in the UAE. I could download via my US account, but not play)
After buy it, how or where can I get my codes? and those codes works with a mexican PS account?
The codes will be sent to your email.
Is it possible to have it en in french?
Yes. I believe you can change the language in game.
I am in Australia and have purchased the base game here (in Aus), will this DLC bundle work on my PS3 with my game?
Absolutely! Just be careful. One or more of the codes may require using the "space bar" rather than dashes (-). The bundle was well worth the price. Get used to being attacked by vampires, a lot.
the game is included in this bundle or just the dlc's?
Just the expansions, not the base game
if i buy this from my computer how does it go to my ps3?
You get codes ! I'd definitely go through amazon and get the codes.
are there any patches that will change the original skyrim disc game?
Yes, but how much it changes the game depends on whether you play on PC or console. All a patch does on a console is fix glitches and bugs and such with the game itself. On PC it does the same but in a way that changes the game in a few ways; for instance there is a patch that fixes the infamous dragon stalking glitch, where dragon skeletons follow you throughout the map, by erasing the dragon skeleton itself as soon as you fast travel away from it. Patches for console don't work this way. If you are on console the only way to really change the game is through DLCs and modded saves, not patches in other words. The most a patch for console will change is how merchants act and erase the ability to take advantage of various glitches. That's about it.
do the codes work on a PS3 thats not registered in the US?
Short answer: yes it should work without a problem. Longer version: You are essentially purchasing the digital version of the game, which wouldn't effect its playability. As long as you can access PSN you can get the game, you just put in the code under "redeem code/voucher" for the "free" download that you purchased here and it does it at no charge. Because of this it should not have any issues as far as countries its registered to. IF YOU DO HAVE ISSUES WITH COUNTRY: all you have to do to fix this issue is make a new profile on your Ps3 that has a US address and download it through that one, doing it this way will give you the game and allow you to access if on all profiles as long as the profile is on your ps3
would this be good for league of legends ,(summoner spells/items)?
I am pretty sure that it would be good for League of Legends. You can install the CD driver, and customize your buttons and also DPI.
Does this last through the daily beatings of a WoW player?
For WoW, you'd want something like the perdition. I've found that mice, no matter the game, well last longer if you ease up on click pressure. It's all subjective though, I've had high end mice die in a few months and bagin bin ones last years. For the price, this mouse is great. Worst case, it doesn't work for you and you move to another.
What does the "power button" activate? and can the "power button" be programmed specifically to certain tasks?
i really didn't understand why they called it "power button", its just another button and as the other is full customizable at the 5 different profiles.. only one button is not customizable and is a little one located below the mouse and its a profile changer, so its perfect solution for changing from an specific game profile to another one.
What does it mean by "selective DPI?" For instance, are you able to have 2500 DPI? Or just 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 etc..
Yeah, it's adjustable, using it at the moment it allows for you to fine tune the DPI to get it exactly to the level ya want it. So like, you have get 2,578 dpi if you wanted.
can someone please link me driver download, my cd reader is broken.
http://redragonzone.com/en/download.aspx then click on Mammoth Driver, hopefully it works. Or you can contact the company on the website and they might be able to send you something more specific. Hope this helps.
Is the Red Dragon Mammoth the same as a MSI Interceptor DS200? If not, what are the differences?
Just looking at it, it is the same. Same specs etc. I have to say this is a great mouse so far.
How loud is the sound when clicking? Right and Left, if there's a difference. Thanks,
The left button click is semi-loud in a quiet environment. Nothing crazy though. The right button is quieter. On a 1-10 scale, 10 being VERY LOUD, id give this mouse a 6-7 overall.
Does this mouse remember your profile settings or more importantly remember your current dpi settings when starting up the computer after a shutdown?
yes, the profiles are saved on the hard drive.
How big is this thing? I have large hands and FPS gaming can be a pain because my thumb and pinky usually drag on the mouse pad causing my shots to..
3.25" wide, 5" long and 1.7" deep, it's really pretty big and would be great for fps cuz the side buttons are very easy to reach and really easy to change the DPI on the fly plus its programmable.
Will this mouse work with Windows 8.1? I have been seeing some reviews of some that have issues with 8.1 for some reason...
Yes, it works without any problem... Tested for 4 months
Redragon Perdition VS the Razor Naga 2014 edition, if you have used both which do you prefer?
They are both excelent, the Redragon is just a bit too large for my hand.
How clickable are the 12 side buttons on a scale from 1-10
I had the Razer Naga before buying this mouse, and the buttons are very easily reachable. There is a slight curve in the buttons, but does not hinder me. I am using the 1-9 buttons, my fingers are too short to reach the 10-12 unless I move my palm. If you have a larger hand/longer fingers, it should be no problem. Very good mouse!
Does the mouse drivers work for Vista? im stuck using it for now.
Yes, the mouse does work with Vista, it's a fantastic mouse, it's the best mouse I've ever had in my opinion.
Can I program the keys to enter passwords?
Absolutely, macro any keys you can press on the keyboard. it would be insecure though, clearly. open the utility, select the key, any key on the mouse is remappable, the drop down menu has nearly every option you can think of: left, middle, right click. forward/backward (up/down arrow really). single-key, combo-key (any two, e.g. ctrl-F1), cut/copy/paste/select all/find/new/print/save, switch window(alt-tab)/close window(alt-F4)/show desktop(windowskey-d)/lock pc, all media controls (play/pause/stop/volume-+/prev/next/mute/mute mic(clutch for voice chat servers), macros which can be any sequence of keys and delays of any length, fire key (which is mouse left click 3x fast, and loops if you hold it down for spamming), dpi cycle, dpi+, dpi-, profile switch, and even disable. you can make any button on the whole mouse into any of these commands. tldnr: yes, passwords and the kitchen sink possible.
Just got this mouse and reprogrammed the side keys in the mouse utility, but for some reason they're not working when i try to use them in WoW. Help?
I use an add on in wow for mine. It is meant for the razer Naga but works on the dragon to. I got the add on from the curse website. I can link to it this afternoon when I get home. Link for the Curse Addon is below: http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/razernaga Did you install the perdition software for the mouse? Mine worked in Wow before I used the add on but I had been playing with the software before that to.
can you program the keys for forward and backward during web browsing?
Yes, you can program any of the buttons for that functionality. However, the top two buttons behind the scroll-wheel already function that way. The front one move forward, the back button moves you backward.
Jeez, what EXACTLY does the red button on top do? Can IT be reprogrammed?
The red button can be programmed. It is like all the other buttons on the mouse, just red(maybe it is a common fire button spot)
Can the scroll wheel be moved right/left for horizontal scrolling (like in some Logitech models)?
No
How many years of warrenty for this mouse?
the box says 18 months
Is it possible to assign Shift, Ctrl, Tab or any other keyboard key to number buttons?
Yes
Does it work with all Call of Duty games?
Yes
can this be used with the xbox one
Yes it can
will this work on a crt television. (older non flat screen tv)
Yes. It should just stick right on the glass. You just have to plug the USB plug into a USB port (I use one of the front ones on my Xbox 360) to power the LED. It will actually probably stick better on the glass CRT TV than on a flat screen because the glass should be a better surface for the suction cups.
So I'm guessing if the game is designed for higher accuracy WHEN aiming, this isn't going to help much. Is that right?
A person aims and fires accurately when they aim down the sight. The device helps you fire better under the hip and helps you quick scope. And it helps a bit when aiming down the sight, when you gave an awkward gun sight.
How do you take it off the tv after playing? Does it lose its suction when you put it back on?
It has a pull off tab on each suction and can be put on and off as many times as you want from tv to any screen you like. If the suction does not cling on as easy after taking it off clean it with a wet cloth and try again it again it more then likely has dust after cleaning it will stick again ..hope this answers your question.
(Any Ideas?)This will be my Review: I cant fix ist on any screens. I tried with LG 42", LG 50", Samsung 21", LG 23" and some other screens in a store.
If you're using a more porous screen, you may need to lick it first... age old suction cup trick.
Is there any way to use these and not cheat?
Good question. Go to Youtube and search for COD Ghosts Hacks. You wont believe all the different hacks that are available and that are being used everyday. How about modded controllers ? Hundreds available thru Amazon. Nothing like shooting a bulldog shotgun with rapid fire. Seems to me that if you not cheating, then you are behind the curve. You are not playing on a level playing field anymore. I've played in a lot of matches, that if you ADS then shoot, your dead. Using the HipShotDot will help you get more kills from hipfire. Cheating, maybe, maybe not. Using the dot has helped me a little bit. I still like using the Variable Magnification Reflex sight for longer shots, but when your face to face with another player, put the red dot on him and fire. Spray and pray if you have to, kill or be killed. Remember that some of the best players having been drawing a red dot on a piece of tape and sticking it on their screen for years.
Is this safe to use on plasma TV ?
yes, dozens of hours used on my plasma with no issues, other than finger prints from finding that perfect center.
whats the difference b/w this and me using a red dry erase marker?
It's alot easier to see in the dark both for quick sighting and spraying with accuracy in a dark building or room. It gives you that extra edge if you need to even the odds alittle.
will it work with ps4
Absolutely. You need a USB connection to power the red led, but it doesn't matter what you connect it to in order to get that power. It works taking advantage of the basic physics of first person shooters - that the center of your screen is your aim point. It does not modify the game itself in any way.
How does this game end? I know it only covers the first 2 movies, so does it end on a cliffhanger?
It ends how the second movie ends --- ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* ********SPOILER ALERT********* They pour the gold on the dragon and then he leaves. Ends with Smaug flying off to Lake Town, and the dwarfs have the mountain. Cliff hanger I guess yeah. But expected. ********END SPOILER ALERT*********
does this game have multiplayer mode?
Yes it does but its only two player and you have to share the screen the split screen does not effect the game play it takes alittle adjusting to but really fun to play with another player
How do you save your game when you're not done with a level? Are there check points or something? My 8 year old is having a terrible time.
There are checkpoints. We always save at a checkpoint; however, I am not sure they really save the level. The checkpoints are statues with a white circle in front of them. Have your child save there and then see if it does save the level. And be sure to quit and save when you end the game. Hope this helps.
Why did this product come in a paper sleave instead of the protective plastic blue ray case?
Sorry I think this person received these for promotional purposes.

Does this work on the original wii also?
No, Wii U games will only work on the Wii U. The hardware inside the system is very different, so the publisher would need to create a separate Wii version. Unfortunately it looks like there will be very few new games available for the original Wii at this point.
Does the WiiU version allow for simultaneous 2 players like the LOTR game did?
Yes. Two player simultaneous is allowed, and FUN!!!
What are the supported controllers?
All
sorry for my naive question,but I want to know how to add second player during game play..I press on the second Wii controller but nothing happened!
Hi, you have to press de + button on the second controller
Does this game require the use of nunchucks? Or can I use a classic controller and Wii U gamepad? Nunchucks never work long for us...
Yes, you use the nunchucks. Unfortunately we have the same problem. It is the wires getting pulled and loose.
is there free roam
Yes, after you complete all the levels, you have "Free Play" where you roam around and complete other quests to get more characters.
Forgive me if this seems a stupid question, but how do you get it into two player mode on the PS3? I don't see any options anywhere!
Well usually hitting a button on the second controller should start the second player. At least that is what it was like on the ps3 version of Indiana Jones I had.
Will this work on wii U hardware purchased overseas - specifically, Japan?
Sorry, I have no idea. Try contacting nintendo.com to find out.
Does the game cover material from the third movie? If so, how extensive?
It only covers the first two movies. The third is supposed to be released as downloadable content.
Can you play this game on a regular wii?
I do not believe Wii U games can be played on a Wii. The Wii U can play both but not the Wii.

Are the graphics that different compared to last-gen (e.g. PS3)?
Yes. 1080p Blu ray quality vs 760 for much crisper look but most importantly its the physics and lighting engines that are much better. I love both platforms but Tombraider shows u the future of games to come on PS4. U might play in 1080 on ps3 on your tv but its stepped up.
Is it normal to see this annoying white flash between screens a camp fire? Not sure if mine is defective because it's irritating/annoying. TYIA.
Yes that is normal.
Is Ps4 game region locked? Will i be able to play this game on Indian PS4 (PAL)?
PS4 games aren't region locked, but however their downloadable contents are , since this game is complete with everything included in it, you don't need to worry about that either. You can easily play it on your indian ps4.
I did not receive a game booklet inside the case. Was it left out or did the game not come with it?
To be honest, none of the new games ---like all of the PS4 games, have a booklet. They may include some little piece of paper but it never has any information about the game, usually just an ad for some other game or maybe an online code. If your game was used but didn't have anything in the case you aren't missing anything of importance. The manuals for the games are all online when you load the game, if you are signed onto the internet you will get an option to view the manual...hope that helps : )
DLC including "Tomb of the Lost Adventurer", Six Outfits is it all in the disk? or do I have to download it from PSN I don't like online Internet
I Bought it used but as far I can recall the outfits are in the disk so the tomb should be there too
Is there a wireless headset I can use with the voice commands?
I believe you can use the ps4 headset included with the system or any other compatible headset.
support korean?
No, not on this version. However, there are many language packs, including Korean, available. There may be a localized version, or a pack available for download on PC.
Do you have to have internet to play this?
You don't need internet access to play the single player story mode, but there are patches that have been pushed out that will greatly increase stability, fix bugs, and add additional features. These patches will require just hopping online briefly with the game.
It is Singal Player or Two Players
Single player with an online multiplayer component.
Excuse me Does this game include Chinese language&#xFF1F;thanks&#xFF01;
Only English bro...
Does this game have 3D capability?
If you are speaking of Stereoscopic 3D, Farsight just released patches to all current tables as well.as DLC on the PS3 to add this feature and plans on adding this "coming soon" to the PS4 version as well. So to answer your question.... NO, but it will.
Can you play region 2 games on a region 1 PS4
Yes
Does the PS4 Pinball Arcade disk version include the pro table features, or must those be purchased separately online?
I would have thought they would have come with it but from what I could tell, they are nowhere. The disk I later realized was the same price as buying all the season 1 tables from PSN without any pro packs, so there really isn't any advantage to getting the disk over buying as a digital download
Will this game play on the PS3 console?
No, PS4 games are not compatible with PS3 systems.
would i like this if i liked paintball two on the xbox 360
Im sorry, Ive never heard of that game. If you like real pinball machine, current or retro, you will like this
Does this have the Star Wars and 3D tables?
No, it doesn't. Those are on the Zen Pinball 2 game.
How good is the flipper action w/ PS4 controller? Does anyone have experience using on other platforms &amp; if so would you say PS4 has the best feel?
pinball arcade is a great game! lots of tables and great graphics. I feel the flipper action could be a little tighter, ever though it's barely noticeable there is a slight lag
Does it work on the PS3?
No
Will this work on PS3?
No it is PS4 only.
To play in multiplayer mode can all players use one controller or does each player need a controller?
Hi joy sorry but there no online multiplayer mode but you can play up for people in the game and yes you can use 1 controller it's great game for the price you get 22 tables lots fun

can this ship overseas, and if so what are the charges?
being that it is fufilled by amazon, yes it ships to APO
is this unit comes with head set?
Yes. It is cheap but functional.
how do digital down loads work?
There is an online store called the Xbox Live Marketplace. From there you can search for anything like games, movies, or music. After finding something you would like to purchase, you enter your credit card, or paypal, and purchase the item. After purchasing, your item will immediately start downloading onto our xbox 360. After your download has finished, you can see it in the "Recent" tile on the main dashboard.
Is the console "glossy" black or "matte" black
matte
is this Kinect compatible
Yes it is
is the kinect capable
Yes you can purchase them from walmart I have also seen them at Amazon. I hope I helped.
Does this console change colors in the light or only when I do acid?
Shrooms makes it loom like rainbows!
Unless I actually worked at a Microsoft factory and produced the console, what is the reason I should buy this ?
Haha you shouldn't. Microsoft released the white edition of the Xbox one with the sunset overdrive bundle releasing October 28th.
What makes it worth 3 grand? And for 3 grand you should hand deliver it instead of charging $11.99 shipping.
nothing, that's why the seller hasn't answered the question nor have they sold the system.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the White Editions only given to the employees who made the Xbox One (which included papers of authenticity)?
You are correct. The original white XBOX One was given to the employees whom helped develop the XBOX One. I am not sure about papers of authenticity but it should have a special code that allows you to download games for free. I do think its pretty resellerish and horrid they seperated the white controller from the package to only further financial gain. Normally employees must sign a statement that they will not resell the item. Honestly, I dont think its legal to sell these for profit.
Hi, is it a 1TB or is it 500GB?
500GB
Is it true that it comes with a nice black case?
What do you mean black case?
does it come with one year of live, all the games, and the code to unlock everything unused? what EXACTLY does this come with?
lol, no, it'll be just the console. You are better off waiting 2-3 months for the white one at the end of october.
Does it come with the white controller and any games?
It says it does not come with the white controller on the description lol. All the lies
So, it comes with all the first party games???
Nope just the system.
I just got mine today and I tried to use it for ps3 and it says I need a pass key. do you no the pass key
It's probably 0000. I never needed to use a Pass Key but if it's asking for one I would thing that is it being that is usually the default number.
Does anyone else feel like the left driver is noticeably louder than the right?
Definitely.. I have the same problem but it's easily adjustable because all music players come with the option of balancing between drivers. So just go to your music player's settings and tweak to suit
Can they connect wireless with PS4
No. This is why I ordered them, and they would show a connection, but then had no audio.
Is there a mute button for chat?
It dos not work as Bluetooth device at all. Works as wired head phone. Even touch control does not respond for muting.
Does anyone think these are SoundBot SB270 clones?
Yes I do.
XBox compatible?
As long as the device has blue tooth capability, it should link it without a problem.
Does the Bluetooth version work with Bluetooth version 4.0?
yes, it can work with bluetooth version 4.0
If I use these headphones with ps3, would I hear the game sound in them also?
Yes, you could hear the sound.The headphone can connect with the PS3
Is there a way to switch between input from an IP phone (on 3.5mm) computer (bluetooth) and smartphone (NFC)?
Yes, but you need to disconnect with the IP phone first, then connect with your smart phone via NFC. RaveTouch connects with ONE device at a time.
Do these headphones have that typical annoying flashing blue light!?
The blue light is directed downwards, and it is quite dim. It doesn't bother me, and I suppose it doesn't bother people around me.
How is the battery life on these headphones?
You can listen to music or your videos basically for a whole day. The sound is pretty decent.
Do these work well for playing video games? Plan to use Bluetooth for music and the 3.5mm jack from the PS4 controller for gaming.
As long as the device you are using is compatible. Make sure that 3.5 mm jack on your PS4 controller is compatible with the RaveTouch input jack. This is very important; because the jacks on some PS4 controllers are smaller than the standard size used on most headsets and devices. If it matches, I highly recommend you get this headphone. What a sound! You will not be disappointed !
is t for ps3??
It works with PS3. Voice is clear. You just gotta have any other device's Bluetooth you synced it with off or else it won't sync with the PS3. The code yoi have to put to sync it is simply 0000. The headset gets uncomfortable after an hour of use tho, but maybe that's all headsets, and I got quite a big head lol.
Are these headphones compatible with Bluetooth 4.0 devices?
Yes, It works great with both my tablet and computer.
are they durable?
Yeah
will this work for playstation 4?
Yes
why do these look exactly like the soundbot ones I just bought?
My guess is that they were both commissioned by the same factory by two different brands/companies. Common practice for a company to develop an idea/product and license it to other brands for marketing/distribution.
WILL THESE WORK WITH PS3?
No idea... But when they worked, I loved them.... Then they didn't, after about 15 hours of use.
how to connect the headphone to my Samsung S4 ?
put your phone on can be recognized by device then when you hold the button for it to flash red and blue then hit Search and it should connect
Is this a knockoff or is this an original 360 controller?
I believe this is a knock off. It feels and looks like a real controller though. It has the same case as the real controller. Just the case has chinese letters. I've had the controller for 2 weeks now and I have had no problems. So for the price, I would get it.
will this work on windows XP? i am wanting a contorller for astronat simulatior.
It could if you customize it but I had a very hard time doing that. In the end I just gave up on this product.
Is this compatible with Windows 8.1?
yes i have played on 8.1 and i works great
Does it work on Mac?
It does. It works better on a Mac, actually. If you have any trouble with it, you can download a driver for it from the Xbox site. Shouldn't be a problem loading it though. Once you plug the controller into the USB port, let it load. All of the drivers should automatically download for you.
Will this controller work on windows 8.1? I am wanting a controller for Watch Dogs.
Yes, I've used it on a number of games on 8.1 with no problems.
is this an original xbox controller
no. it's a xbox 360 controller that can also be used as a gamepad for your computer.
Is the language uesd in the game Japnese or English? I am looking for the Japanese version.
No it's in English. There is English and Japanese voice overs though. It can be changed on the game options.
Do I have to play any other Atelier games to understand this one?
No it's the easiest one to get into.
I have never played any games in the Atelier series, does this game provide tutorials for newcomers to the alchemy system?
Yes, there is tutorials for newcomers and I suggest you read it careful too plus don't speed through it.
Have spanish subtitles?
No, I'm afraid not. It comes with English or Japanese audio tracks and English subtitles only.

By all DLC included, will the Agency weapons, including the Silverballer come with it? If so, does it have the silencer?
The Problem for you and Others,is Amazon should have put or shown the back of the Box as well ,to answer; yes and no,let me explain; Quoted from the box; then it will answer almost any question; From the box; Tomb of the Lost Adventurer , 6 outfits for Lara ( nothing sexy ) kind of ugly(my opinion) ,8 Multiplayer Maps, 6 Multiplayer weapons ( that is what you asked specifically) 4 Multiplayer characters . so once you have certain levels in multiplayer you can attain these ,need be,play on single person or private .BUT; note the downloads are not in the disc you must REDEEM 8 long codes to, get these items ,you start with nothing and work your way up .(Spoilers Ahead) the weapon or pistol is simply that in single player and you must find parts or earn them as you level up in the game ,different areas,etc.. If you have the game and like it then ,i wouldn't even get this,the only reason i did ,i have been collecting Tomb Raider or Lara Croft items Many years,this kind of ticked me off when they could have included these items on the disc for a G.O.T.Y. ,all companies are lazy and stingy now..hope i helped some..Later....
Is it worth it to get the GOTY edition or is the regular one ok?
my personal choice is the regular one
please, do you know if it has portuguese Br legend?
I just checked and unfortunately it does not have Portuguese voice, but it does have Portuguese subtitles.
Amazon states that the DLC is "included". Is all of the content on a disc, or is it one of those vouchers?
It is long codes for each DLC
Is this game the same as the definitive edition, content wise?
I believe it is, I don't know anything about the definitive edition I think the definitive edition is Xbone exclusive, while the GotY ediotion is for 360.
Does anyone knows if it works with WiiU, nintendo 3ds,and PC? It's because I've seen one of this model Kunai(advertise of the company)saying that.
Ya I'm pretty sure it does just remember if u buy this make sure it's for someone with little ears lol
is this PS3 friendly
Yes it is, I have both a PS3 and PS4 and it works perfectly with them. With the 3 you must attach the adaptor cable though but with the 4 you can plug it straight into the controller. Hope this helps!
Do they have more bass than the playstation golds? The golds sound great just don't have that extra kick I'm looking for..
I haven't used the play stations gold so I can't really say. But I can say that the Tritton Kunai sounds really good for the buck.
Can I connect these to my PS4 so I can use the inline controller? It is a must-have for me to have a quick mute for my headset.
Hello, You can use the Inline cable as long as your TV has an audio output section on it which is attached to the inline. The PS4 itself does not have these connections so as long as you can connect to a RCA output via your TV you will be able to use the inline.
does the titan fall version for mac and pc work for laptops?
Yes it does!
IS THIS HEADSET WIRELESS?
No
could you remove the boom mic
Yes, you can.
Is this good for people with big heads?
It can extend, but big ears no
can you hear your own voice with this headset?
Not unless your partners have the TV up where your voice comes through the TV and back through the mic. The Mic is really good.
How long is the regular 3.5 mm headphone jack before being attached to the in-line controls?
I want to say 4 to 5 inches. Its plenty long enough to reach the front of your mouth

We have a MacBook Pro 2011. What version should we purchase (DVD, instant download, PC?) We want to make sure it's compatible on a Mac.
None of these editions are compatible with MacOS X, this game requires Windows. See the system requirements.
What does buying instant access get you? like a code for origin?
Yes
Can I play when I'm offline.
Nothing to do offline :(
what's instant access?
You log into your Origin account and begin downloading after the purchase. No entering codes or waiting for an email.
What is instant access? Is it like getting the digital code? Will the same code work for Xbox Juan?
You put the code into Origin. Doesn't work for xbox.
What is the difference between instant access and PC?
They give you a code to immediately redeem on Origin. Then you can download and play.
Can I buy this for someone in Europe and link his origin account? Will he be able to play it?
I can't imagine why not, but you should probably direct this to Origin just to be sure.
Is it possible to buy a copy of the Instant Access version for someone else's account?
it is possible you get a code and input the code in origin, whomever puts in the code first gets the game so you could buy an instant access code and then give it away.
How well does this game run on a 2012 non-Retina 13-inch MacBook Pro (Windows 8)? Is it playable on at least the minimum settings?
Sorry mate, Windows OS Only. Minimum System Requirements: Supported OS: 64-bit Windows 7, 8, 8.1 Processor: AMD Athlon X2 2.8GHz or Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz RAM: 4 GB Video Memory: 512 MB Video Card: Radeon HD 4770 or GeForce 8800GT

Can this work for Xbox one
No
can anyone tell me how is the audio positioning on these headphones?
These use the same drivers as the ad700 which was rated #1 in audio positioning in the world by hundreds of pro players and audio enthusiasts.
What systems do these work with? or just PC?
Ps4 compatible and I use it on my xbox one. I bought some triton headphones and I use the adapter that came with the tritons. Very nice. Scary awesome with advanced warfare.
If you take the 3.5mm TRRS jack at the end of the short cable and plug it into an iPhone instead of to the extension cable, what happens?
It works perfectly fine without the extension cable. I have tried it using FaceTime and cellphone calls. Audio and voice come through clearly on my end and the other end.
is the cable from the headset detachable, thats the only thing stopping me from buying this
No, it's not detachable.
with the open back, I'm concerned about audio bleed into the mic. can anyone comment?
My friends haven't noticed anything during gaming sessions. There was this one time I had extremely loud volume when my friend was able to hear himself, but that wasn't a comfortable volume level anyways. Note that I don't even have any echoing or noise cancellation activated, so it's probably not going to be any problem.
I have ATH-M50, is it okay to buy this or stay with M50? Thanks.
If you're using them for gaming. I would say yes, the mic quality is very good in this headset. The highs and lows are also supreme for knowing where the enemy is or just the ambiance
is this better them the sennheiser pc363d
Thank you for your interest. These headsets are very different. The sennheiser is closed back and therefore will offer deeper bass response while the athadg1 is open back for better mid and high tones. Also, I have used the athadg1 headset and would argue that it is one of if not the most comfortable headsets currently available. Hope this helped.
Anyone else's ear cup joints a little loose/wiggly?
Mine were
In terms of audio, what's the difference between these and the AD-700's?
They are pretty similar but I want to say that having all the AD700 (not ad700x) and the adg1, a700, and ag1, I will say that the adg1 is great for gaming/smartphone but I feel they aren't as "open" as the ad700. I'm told they are a lot more like the ad700x which is a slightly different design but the frequency response is the same. Oh and the extension/splitter cord broke on mine after dropping the headset while it was plugged in. I can probably fix it but I just used the little sub soundcard/amp that came with it. It works really quite well!
How well does the microphone pick up noise from the keyboard? I use a blue switch mechanical keyboard.
I got no complaints about my keyboard clicks. I have mechenical keyboard from razor it's a black widow
Does the Collector's edition include Diablo 3, or do you still need to buy it separately?
No, it's not included. You should buy it separately.
Does this Collectors Edition D3 come as a large box, like the original Diablo 3 box CE set?
Yep. Same size with different theme color.
It has been awhile since i have played, but would all my stats and gear from Diablo 3 carry over?
Yes
This game have a Spanish Leguage?
Yes! AVAILABLE LANGUAGES English (US), Espaol (AL), Portugus (AL), English (EU), Deutsch, Espaol (EU), Franais, Italiano, Polski, &#1056;&#1091;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;, &#54620;&#44397;&#50612;, &#32321;&#39636;&#20013;&#25991;, English (SEA)
Is reapers of souls online play only?
yes.
Does this edition come with the Angel Wings for your character?
No, the angel wings come in the first CE. This one has no exclusive in game contents... Sad.
Does this game is the digital, or fisical issue?
Its the fisical
Are the codes for the game and the extra DLC seperate?
If you mean by DLC the hearthstone codes yes, for the other things no, since when you register the game it registers as the CE and it gives you automatically the other things
is Diablo III: Reaper of Souls Collector's Edition work with standard diablo 3 ?
Yes. The collectors edition in-game items are only cosmetic.
Is the mouse comfortable? It doesn't look very ergonomic.
I use a finger tip grip on my mouse and feels very good, i think its pretty good for palm grips also infographic about the different types of grips: http://i1.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/400/draft_lens20671124module166214746photo_1361298718a____a_.png
How is the mouse wheel? Can you feel it when you scroll with the mouse or is it more like 'slippery'?
The mouse wheel is very smooth and you can definitely feel it when you scroll.
Can you change to any color without the dpi changing? Or is each color locked into a dpi preset? Thanks!
The colors are locked to the 4 presets as far as I can tell, but you can change the sensitivity of each preset. Usually the most sensitive preset is this weird pink color, but I changed it so that the green color was the most sensitive because I like it more.
Has anyone tried this mouse with LoL? If so, how effective is it? LoL is the reason I just purchased this as well as a Razer Tartarus Keypad. Thanks!
This mouse is great for gaming. The 2 thumb buttons can easily be mapped to game functions. (I haven't tried it with LoL, but I used to be a big LoL player.) The mouse looks pretty cool too :)
Can this just be a plug and play?
Likely yes. However, you will give up convenient color/speed/button setting features.
The lights come on, but the mouse and buttons won't move or work?
Was a tad bit wonky on first use. After I installed the driver/config software it work okay. What OS are you using? I am not sure if it is completely Win 8/8.1 compatible.
Does your scroll wheel wobble? Mine wobbles significantly. Makes a jittering noise if I shake the mouse.
I think that is the weights in the mouse
Is this unit region-specific?
Nope! Sony products (unless specified) are region free.
What PCH model are the units?
PCH-1001 - OLED Screen, no 3G
are the O and X buttons swapped?
No they are not swapped on the Vita. Standard PlayStation button layout, the same as the DualShock 1/2/3/4
Does the product come with charger and usb cable? Along with the games in a separate package?
Yes it does it comes with everything a brand new one would
can you make the cards VERY LARGE?
The only size adjustment I have found is by making the starting screen go to full screen. I have not found a way to size the screen to a desired partial size or a way to control the size of the cards.
does it run on Windows 8
Yes, I think so. I just downloaded it onto 8.1, and it is running fine.
Help - Which of these solitaire games is the good old fashioned basic solitaire ???
None. but, I've started enjoying Scorpion a lot. Although it takes a while to get the knack of it, it is actually fun!
There is a statement that you can see others "high" scores to compare, is this an online game?
My all-in-one game is not at online game. But, I have seen before that you can see others scores. Good luck with yours...! :)
I get the following error while updating the game: "The application cannot be installed due to a certificate problem..."
Dear Margie, You have to uninstall old version of the game manually, then you will be able to update the game without any problems. Thank you!
I get the following error while updating the game: "The application could not be installed because an application with that name already exists..."

does this game have undo option?
you can only undo your last move. It has 13 games. It has hint.
is this the same freecell on my windows seven computer
No it is not. I found the All-in-One Solitaire really disappointing. I deleted it from my computer.
didn't download correctly computer says it is not a correct win 32 product
I did download it after some trouble. The game was awful and Norton said it may have a virus. I deleted it from my computer. Just glad it was as cheap as it was.
I like the game but I don't here only thing
I like the games sometimes, too, but sometimes I don't. My favorite is Triple Free Cell, but it takes sort of a long time to play, and a good bit of patience. Once in a while, when I have finally reached the point so I will win, one of the cards just takes off on its own, drifts right off the page! And the whole thing freezes. Nothing more you can do. Frustrating.

I get the following error while updating the game: "The application could not be installed because an application with that name already exists..."

does this game have undo option?
you can only undo your last move. It has 13 games. It has hint.
is this the same freecell on my windows seven computer
No it is not. I found the All-in-One Solitaire really disappointing. I deleted it from my computer.
didn't download correctly computer says it is not a correct win 32 product
I did download it after some trouble. The game was awful and Norton said it may have a virus. I deleted it from my computer. Just glad it was as cheap as it was.
I like the game but I don't here only thing
I like the games sometimes, too, but sometimes I don't. My favorite is Triple Free Cell, but it takes sort of a long time to play, and a good bit of patience. Once in a while, when I have finally reached the point so I will win, one of the cards just takes off on its own, drifts right off the page! And the whole thing freezes. Nothing more you can do. Frustrating.
can you make the cards VERY LARGE?
The only size adjustment I have found is by making the starting screen go to full screen. I have not found a way to size the screen to a desired partial size or a way to control the size of the cards.
does it run on Windows 8
Yes, I think so. I just downloaded it onto 8.1, and it is running fine.
Help - Which of these solitaire games is the good old fashioned basic solitaire ???
None. but, I've started enjoying Scorpion a lot. Although it takes a while to get the knack of it, it is actually fun!
There is a statement that you can see others "high" scores to compare, is this an online game?
My all-in-one game is not at online game. But, I have seen before that you can see others scores. Good luck with yours...! :)

Can you turn the light off? Or, does it turn off while in stand-by mode?
Light stays on when the ps4 is on standby and on mode, only turns off is ps4 is off or if you unplug the usb.
Does this cause the PS4 to overheat? There is no vent
No I never have overheating issues..heat dissipates up so a vent on the bottom wouldn't matter
just got this today, was excited, but then connected it and to my surprise the lights on the stand won't come on even though the PS4 is turned on
You should just return, lights should turn on when your ps4 is ON and connected to the USB port.
Is it possible to stand the PS4 on the opposite side than shown in the picture above? I ask because the main intake is on the side face down.
No I don't think so. But there is an inter cooler accessory similar to this one with extra USB ports just without the led lifhts
How high is the ps4 with stand attached (exact figure please)?
11.5"
is the difference between the limited edition and the standard edition significant?
I bought the limited edition for $35 and it didn't really come with anything cool. So just stick with the standard because I just checked the price for the limited and Its not worth it.
looking into getting a ps4 for Christmas I played the first game and really liked it is this game on par or better then the first infamous?
Imo I think it's better than the first. In this one, the graphics are gorgeous and every facial animation is incredible; I found myself deeply immersed during the cut scenes. Also, the game play is phenomenal; and as you progress in the story they give you new powers; each very unique and different than the last; with each new power you get a whole new atomic bomb for it! They also give you the choice to switch between the different powers when ever you want! The only con about the game, imo, is the minor differences between the good/evil power sets; they are pretty much the same, but the different powers you get makes up for it. Overall I give this game a 9; and I recommend it to all ps4 players! Happy gaming!
how many language i can choose?
Just English
Hi, is there a cooperative multi-player mode? If so, does it require a separate console per player? Thanks!
No multiplayer. Just single player campaign.
Should I play the original Infamous games to fully understand Second Son?
No
Are there super attacks like in infamous
yes
what does " All region" mean, in back of cover?
This means that you can play the game everywhere across the world. Like if you live in Europe, Africa, Asia and America the disc works in all of them.
which is the best standard edition or limited edition?
If you're buying used, the limited edition will most likely be useless as any DLC codes will have been redeemed already. If there is no price difference, I would say get the limited edition for the heck of it. As far as the actual game goes though, there is no difference that I'm aware of.
Out of all these editions, which is the better one with many bonus features and such?
Yes
I'm french and i want to buy the game but in the game option can we change the language to french ?
Yes , i saw it on settings
Will it work with the game "Elite: Dangerous"?
Yes it absolutely will. Elite Dangerous has a specific setting for the x-55 stick under control settings. Also all of the buttons on the x-55 stick can be easily re-configured any way you want them. So any button can become whatever you want that button to be. Hope that makes sense.
dos it have twist action for rudder ,thank you
Yes it does. However, unlike the X52 series, there is no pin on the stick to prevent the twist action. I hear one has to disable this in the driver settings if one has special foot peddles for the rudder.
Are there any plans to make one for left-handed people? I would really like to purchase a setup like this for Star Citizen.
Considering aircraft in real life are not built with "left-handed" configurations, I very much doubt it. Left-handed pilots in the modern-day Air Force simply learn to fly the standard configuration.
My question is about the 'stick twist' and the 'throttle' axii. I have been told by Saitek they are "high quality pots". How many bits resolution?
I really can't give a specific answer for the X 55. but I have the X 52 Pro and am well pleased with the sensitivity. Also you can get a paid version of the FS4UIPC and that opens up a lot of options in FSX for all controllers. Sorry I cant be more specific, but if it is as good as the X 52 Pro, and has dual throttle functions, may be worth the price difference. Also the X 55 requires 2 free usb ports while the X 52 requires only one. The x 52 Stick connects to the throttle and the throttle connects to usb.
I want to know if the X-55 will fit on my sim stand. Can someone measure them and tell me the length x width x height of the bases only? Thanks.
Both bases are the same, in inches, Length:(front to back) 8 3/4 in, Width: 7 1/4 in, Height: 2
Is the primary trigger one or two stage?
The trigger is single stage.
Do you ship this item to my contry ? Brazil ? and, how it cost ? thanks
Uh... Amazon does. Just add it to your cart and check. You'll have to pay the import taxes upfront. Those are MORE expensive than the unit... But it'll get sent straight to your house. No fuss. I just tried with my address (I'm from Rio de Janeiro), and the total was about US$ 443.00. Still... This seems to be in pre-order? 1-3 months to ship... The Saitek site has as of today (Aug 28) pre-order buttons. Maybe they're out of stock?
does this stick come with a cd at all and is this batter then hotas warhog.
no & no
Does it pay to get a used x52 pro. The Warthog is close to $500 and the less than stellar reviews for this item on Amazon and elsewhere are scary.
The X52's stick was way to loose for me for precision corrections. It also had a dead zone that I just didn't like. X-55 is much, much better.
It looks like the theres backlighting on the throttle controller. Is this device backlit?
Yes, you can change the colors from blue, red, green, amber on throttle and joystick.
Will I be able to keep this case on while using this charging kit? http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E... Or do I need to take it off each time?
If you attach the controller to the charging cable wires... yes but if you have a ps4 charging dock it will not work with grips on.
If the silicone affects the movement can it be worn down to the point where the movement is not affected by the case?
I guess it can, if you have enough friction. They fit not perfect, but pretty good. For me it did not affect the analog sticks. The face buttons might take a while to get use to. Cause now when u push on them they don't seem to move much. Cause the thickness of the skin. I hope that helps.
Will I be able to keep this case on while using this charging kit?
Definetely no need for removal
Where do you ship from?
We Are Ships From China,shipping by USPS with tracking number from China 7-14 business days delivery.
Will it affect the movement of the thumb sticks?
It doesnt effect mine at all, u know when u have no skin on it an u move it up an down it makes like a crack or a snap noise u may not hear that but it doesnt make a difference with the mobility but if u do have a problem u jus may need to adjust the skin on the controller jus by pushing down under the analog when the skin is on an u should have no problems...
Where is the All-Stars Battle Royale game? Is it downloaded or CD included?
the game is included in the box
Is it normal for this thing to take forever to ship? I ordered it in mid-April and it still hasn't shipped yet.
Our store will ship out in 24 hours if you purchase from us.
Can you play PS2 games w/ this PS3?
No, this PS3 cannot play PS2 games. The PS3 model that allows PS2 back-play essentially has a PS2 inside that allows the back-ward compatibility, making that model MUCH heavier. PSone playback however is possible. Of course, PS2 games that have been brought into the PSN for digital download for the PS3 can play on here.
what is the Quantity of weight of console
Not terribly heavy. Probably weighs as much as my 15" laptop. Hope this helps.
Blue 250gb PS3 font is 120/240v?
I bought it for my son so who lives out of state so I don't know. If you live in America call gamestop or look one up online and call and ask them and they will probably be more able to answer your questions. The reason I bought the PS3 instead of the ps4 is because you can still get online free with PS3, they are still making games for PS3 and lastly I read online the ps4 has been having a lot of issues and the PS3 have been around a lot longer and for the most part have already fixed their glitches. Good luck bro and I do recommend this product coming from a happy dad who son loves it :-).
does this work with the Vita?
yes
does this work with the ps3
No it DOES NOT work with the ps3 console. However there are a lot of blue tooth headsets that are great
can you use this as a pc headset?
Given the proper tool, yes, it can be used as a PC Headset. http://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Headset-PC-Adapter-01-PH35-PC35/dp/B008OB2NHA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1425980284&sr=1-1&keywords=3.5mm+headset+to+pc+adapter &lt;- With that, you can plug it into both plugs of a PC and use it as a headset.
My laptop has a joint audio/mic 3.5mm jack, so theoretically, even the mic should work for my laptop, correct?
yes theoretically that should work just fine but if u buy it and it doesn't i am sure amazon would give you a refund
does this work with the ps3?
No just ps4 ps vita and also works with xbox1
Is this a wireless headset? Meaning, is the cord going from the PS4, across the floor to my controller? My cat thinks the cords are a toy.
The cord can be plugged into your controller. So, yes, there's a cord. But, no, it shouldn't be going across your floor because it goes from your headphones straight to your controller; not the PS4 unit.
What other headsets did you consider prior to buying these?
The gold edition wireless and I have them now they are more then worth the money
We plugged in theadset to controller for ps4 but in Settings, then Sound and Screen, then audio output settings, no "output to headphones"...help?
The options should be "Chat Only", which only sends the chat talk, or "All" which sends chat plus all game sounds.
Can you hear your own voice with these headphones?
Not unless youre testing the mic
Question is it compatible for a PS4 and can you talk and hear the game while playing online?
Yes it is compatible for a ps4. Yes you can talk and hear the game while playing online you just have to change your settings.

still no date?
May 6th 2014 in the US
Is this the WiFi or 3G model?
As far as I understand it they've 86'd the 3G feature. WiFi only for the new slim model.
Will this have the MicroUSB charging port rather than the proprietary port Sony was using for the OLED versions?
Yes actually they have switched for the slim to the standard micro usb charge port! WooHoo!
Why is this 100 dollars cheaper than a Vita without any games?
It's cheaper because most of the prices you see over $200 are for people selling them above the MSRP. The price for both the 3G and Wifi models of the original Vita dropped to $200 a few months ago, but quickly sold out from most places that sell for the typical MSRP; everyone started marking up the price to better match demand.
The description for the included game, Borderlands 2, says you can have 4 players. I've read elsewhere that it is really only 2 players. Is it 2 or 4?
two players Co-op
Could you give a complete list of items in the box please? Ex: Chargers, cables, adapters etc...
There is an ign unboxing video. http://www.ign.com/videos/2014/04/29/ps-vita-borderlands-2-bundle-unboxing-video Basically: - USB charger + adapter - PS Vita Slim - Borderlands 2 voucher
Will this bundle arrive on release day? Or will we need to wait for it ship after the release date?
Got my e-mail yesterday saying it will be delivered on the 8th so it looks like we have to wait. Not too happy about that.
borderlands 2 doesn't officially release until may 13th. Does that mean bundle buyers will have early access?
Yes
Can these play Japanese games? Is it region locked at all?
No the ps vita is not region locked. Japanese games should work fine
It sucks having to wait until the 8th, but it releases tomorrow, and i paid for 1 day shipping. So I shouldn't have to wait until Thursday. Right???
My hope is that Amazon is being cautious and giving themselves a buffer now. So that when you possibly get it on the 7th you'll be pleasantly surprised. That being said it sounds like Amazon got their shipments in late so that instead of having them day(s) before release so you get it on release day...now they are all after the date. That's what is sounded like when I talked to customer service. Very apologetic but not much they can do. I have 1 day shipping and it's the 8th for me too. I also confirmed that they did NOT oversell the preorders. That was my fear.
Regarding the critical comments, do you think attaching a simple velcro strip would solve the problem of is not staying attached?
I doubt it. The back bracket wouldn't stay in place or support the weight. I ordered a different one that cost a little more and am quite satisfied. They were quite good about arranging the return and refund. I bought a PDP Kinect TV Mount.
I have a wall mount tv. How far back does the mount extend?
I would say you need about 3" from the back side of the tv to the wall. That should do it.
Would the Xbox 360 Kinect clip work for the Xbox One Kinect?
No they are two different set-ups, one won't work for the other
I want to play my kinect on my old LCD tv which is 3 inches wide. Does this fit on it?? Does it have enough width so that the back flap works?
It should work as my son's TV is an older LCD (at least 3-4 years old) also; I never measured it exactly but he had no trouble attaching. I know for sure it's not one of those very slim edges that are on the market today. Should work fine.
Does it work for Samsung curved TVs?
I'd be surprised if it did. I bought this for my flat 42" LG and it wouldn't lock tight up top and sat flimsily on top of my television. Spend the extra few bucks for the PDP mount.
Does the Kinect actually clip on and become secured to the unit or does this item just act as a wide table for it to sit on?
Yes it snaps on to it
Will this fit an LED screen? Credit Card thin might be a problem unless this thing really adjust to the monitor.
Yes it does.
how thick is the lip of it that grabs the tv's bezel? I'm worried this might not fit my tv with a pretty slim bezel and might cover some of my screen.
I own a zero edge TV and you can't even notice it.
Will this work on a tv that is mounted on the wall?
I would say yes as long as the tv is facing at a downward angle with at least 3 inches or more space between wall and mount if that makes any sense. Hope that helps if flat it will either fit or won't. Sorry if it doesn't as my tv is not on my wall.
Can this be used to mount the Kinect to the bottom of the TV?
I bought $1.99 Velcro 2 way tape works great, You can put it any were on the tv
So.. . I look at one of the previous customer review on your product saying that the paddles are hard to press.. .? Why is that?
I recently bought one of these controllers and they work great. I have never owned an actual SCUF so I can't compare, but the paddles do not seem hard to press at all. The only problem I had with mine was that it was difficult to plug the microphone in to the controller because the motherboard inside was slightly off. I contacted the seller and he walked me through how to deal with the issue. It works fine now. Hope this helps.
Any way to get 4 paddles? Will the trigger stops work with Titanfall and COD?
yes they will
I just purchased this from you guys. Does this come with the rechargeable battery pack?
No. It doesn't.
Can i get the original xboxone analog sticks instead of the ps4 dome one?
If you want the default joysticks of the Xbox One, please message me and I will make sure to get you one without the dome joystick.
Who manufactures this thing? Where can I find warranty information?
I have no clue they never respond to service requests
I have one question. I get video from this cable, but no audio at all. Is there any way to get sound from this cable when it's plugged in?
Your T.V. probably doesn't blend the VGA with your audio input. What you need is a 3.5 audio jack to a female RCA jack. This should 100% fix your problem.
Does the Dreamcast main menu look yellowish? I just unhooked from a CRT screen (S-video) and hooked my DC up to my HDTV w/ this cable. Looks yellow?
No, it doesn't look yellowish in my HDTV using this VGA cable. I would double check the color settings on your HDTV first to make sure your cabel is not defective.
So this came in the mail yesterday, and I'm not getting any picture. I have an audio splitter and I can hear some sound. Any idea why?
This is most likely due to the monitor not supporting the native Dreamcast resolution of 640x480. Try an alternate display device. The cable is a pass through style cable, that simply takes the signal from the dreamcast (which outputs VGA for supported games) and passes it to the VGA monitor. Some newer tv's and flat panel monitors don't properly support 640x480.
Hello, Some people say the sound is RCA only. What is that and how can I convert the sound properly?
You get an RCA adapter that allows you to connect the red and white cable and convert them into a standard headphone output.
Can you hook up the DC to your PC?
Not your PC but your monitor.
Just got this cable from Amazon. Fits my 42" vizio nicely. However, the screen colors are skewed and oddly green. Anyone else experiencing this?
The cable didn't work on my TV. On a computer monitor it looked amazing. Only way I can see it working is with a VGA to HDMI adapter, but you have to dish out some extra bucks. The cheap ones do not work. I tried two and the colors had a yellow hue. Test the cable first on a monitor, if its clear it works. If its still bad its possible you may have a defect.
I got the cable this week and when I turn on my Dreamcast the screen flickers everyone so often. Is the cable I got defective?
Yes
How long in feet is the cable?
6ft
I know that light gun games do not work with HDTV's. But...becase this is connected through VGA has anyone tried to see if light gun games work?
As I understand it, light guns require A) a CRT, and B) a certain refresh rate that modern HDTVs (CRT or otherwise) don't support. I'm sure someone will be able to give you a more detailed answer, but I would think that the only way it might work is using an older non-HDTV CRT display. And to answer your question more directly - no, I haven't tried it. :)
My VGA cable doesn't show anything. I can't hear it or see it.
Not all Dreamcast games are VGA compatible. There are workarounds for some of those that aren't, bit you would have to search for that online. Most games will work even if not advertised though. If it is not working on any games, you may want to check your setup or see about returning it. Mine works with almost any game.
I have px3. I hooked it up where my game in sound on the transmitter is connected to my headphone Jack on TV. why do I need this cable??
I thought you only needed it for ps4 to go from the controller to the headset for voice chat I didn't think you need it for ps3 I could be wrong tho
I have turtle beach earforce x31s will this cord work with that so that i can use my headset i already have with my system?
I have the xp400s and it works fine for me, if you headset has the 2.5mm plug on it and your controller/ adapter has the 3.5mm plug, then yes, it will work. I have an Xbox One and the chat headset adapter
can you adjust the game volume and chat audio indepently from each other
There is no in-line volume control on this audio cable. The game volume is controlled by headset (depending on the headset) while chat volume is controlled via the headset options on the PS4.
So I have x12's for the 360 and I lost my chat cable, if I were to buy this will it work on my PS4?

Does this product work for headset to desktop mac?
This cable is designed to connect a compatible headset to a PS4 controller for mic/chat functionality. It is not designed-for or supported-on Mac systems.
will this work for Xbox360? and also will it work for the turtle beach phantom headset?
I don't think it will work for the Xbox 360 because the plugin on the controller side is different. Which is why I purchased this cable to use with my ps4.
I have COD black ops II xrays for my PS 3, Will this allow the xrays to work with PS 4??
Not sure. We had actual turtle beach earphones and it didn't work. Ended up just getting the Sony headset instead of returning the cord...
I like to game with the TV sounds on certain games, and with my headset on others like cod. Mine has a transmitter so does this cable make it pointles
Umm.. Not quite sure what you mean. In my set up, this cord connects to my controller and headsets mic output. It's the part that allows others to hear me in chat. Everything I use is corded though. If you can transmit your voice in chat with out a cord connected to your controllers mic input, this cord isn't needed.
I have the Tango's and on turtle beach's website it says I need this cord to connect to an xbox one adapter, my question is will it work with one?
Yes
What is the average battery life of this headset?
the battery life is very good, the duration is 7 hours or more. I charge every 2 days.
Can I use 2 headset while on my playstation3?
https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5244/kw/headset Frequently Asked Questions Question: How many Gold Headsets can I use with my PlayStation system? Answer: On the PS4 system, you can use up to two Gold Headsets at a time. On the PS3 system, you can use one PlayStation headset at a time.
Can this headset be used by jacking into the (PS4) controller instead of the wireless option? And if it can work, is there any drop in sound quality via the 3.5mm?
Hi, yes you CAN use this via 3.5mm jack (the cable is included). Sound quality stays the same when the battary is charged but if your battary is dead and you are using it with the cable plugged into PS4 controller the sound quality will be lower but I repeat ONLY if the battary is dead, if it is NOT, it will work like a pro either wired or wirelessly. Hope this helps. I sometimes forget I have them on, that's how unbelievably comfortable they are. I think the sound is comming from my sound system and have to actually feel my head to make sure they are on (I think that only happens when the volume is lowered) with the volume high you wount have this problem.
Does the sounds on the headset leak? if i were to play loud music on these, would other people around me hear the music as well?
No my gf sleeps right next to me wile I play all my games, this headset does not leak at all from my gf standpoint and I have it very loud sometimes.
is there a separate volume button for chat sound and game sound?
You can adjust the volume and chat sound to make each loader or quieter, or turn off each all together.
Can you use the wireless and 3.5mm simultaneously? For example plugging into your own music device while playing a game.
you can buy an astro gaming mix amp for that.
Does the virtual 7.1 work with blu-ray movies via ps3 or ps4?
I've tried it on both the PS3 and PS4 with Frozen, which has 7.1 sound track. And it does seem to handle the surround sound well enough that you can definitely discern ambient sounds, directionality of movement and effects, and separation of musical instruments from each other. It's not the GREATEST surround sound headset, but I can still enjoy the movie using them. FYI, I use this for my XBone as well.
Has anyone tried it on the xbox?
Yes, it does work for xbox one with the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter
Can you watch movies on gold wireless headset on the ps 4 if I put blue-ray movies in the ps4
Yes you can..it works also on other devices such as music players and mobile phones by using the 3.5 mm cable...its included in the package
Is it worth trying if I wear glasses? I tried a few headsets before and almost every of them was uncomfortable.
My son and I both wear glasses and have no problems with them.
What is the average battery life of this headset?
the battery life is very good, the duration is 7 hours or more. I charge every 2 days.
Can I use 2 headset while on my playstation3?
https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5244/kw/headset Frequently Asked Questions Question: How many Gold Headsets can I use with my PlayStation system? Answer: On the PS4 system, you can use up to two Gold Headsets at a time. On the PS3 system, you can use one PlayStation headset at a time.
Can this headset be used by jacking into the (PS4) controller instead of the wireless option? And if it can work, is there any drop in sound quality via the 3.5mm?
Hi, yes you CAN use this via 3.5mm jack (the cable is included). Sound quality stays the same when the battary is charged but if your battary is dead and you are using it with the cable plugged into PS4 controller the sound quality will be lower but I repeat ONLY if the battary is dead, if it is NOT, it will work like a pro either wired or wirelessly. Hope this helps. I sometimes forget I have them on, that's how unbelievably comfortable they are. I think the sound is comming from my sound system and have to actually feel my head to make sure they are on (I think that only happens when the volume is lowered) with the volume high you wount have this problem.
Does the sounds on the headset leak? if i were to play loud music on these, would other people around me hear the music as well?
No my gf sleeps right next to me wile I play all my games, this headset does not leak at all from my gf standpoint and I have it very loud sometimes.
is there a separate volume button for chat sound and game sound?
You can adjust the volume and chat sound to make each loader or quieter, or turn off each all together.
Can you use the wireless and 3.5mm simultaneously? For example plugging into your own music device while playing a game.
you can buy an astro gaming mix amp for that.
Does the virtual 7.1 work with blu-ray movies via ps3 or ps4?
I've tried it on both the PS3 and PS4 with Frozen, which has 7.1 sound track.

Linux compatibility?
Yes, full support for anything above Ubuntu 12.04
Is LM mount for oculus rift sold by amazon along with this sensor?
it may be seperate but it is possible to get the to together for a good price.
I am making a desktop computer jukebox, would I be able to select music and open programs without a mouse using this?
The Leap Motion can be used as a mouse but requires complex handling and clicking is very tricky sometimes,...I wouldn't count on it...
Can it be plugged into a USB 3.0 hub or does it have to be plugged directly into the computer?
As long as the cable reaches the computer tower its ok.
In order to use this, does your hand have to be directly over the sensor? Or are you able to use it from a distance?
it can be around 10 inches away side to side but not back and fourth
Does this take the place of the mouse in controlling the OS and all apps, or only on the special apps that come with the Leap Motion device?
This product is will not replace your mouse. You can use it to perform similar things as a mouse, but it's so horrible at it that you'll go back to your mouse as your primary way of interacting with your computer. My "Leap Motion" device is so not useful, that its just been sitting on my desk under a stack of paper for months. Can't find a real, everyday use for this device other than to just play around with it's apps.
Is there a reliable way to use this to "swipe" through Powerpoint presentations yet?
There are apps that will allow you to program actions for your personal use, such as programming a swipe as skipping a slide in powerpoint, but this can be complex, though there may be apps that assist you in this already...
What's the length of the USB cable that comes packaged with the product?
I got 2 cables, one was a very short one, perhaps 15-20 cm, while the other one i got was longer, around half a meter maybe...
Is this more useful than a Nintendo Power Glove?
if you want motion controlling for gaming i think you've only got the razer hydra for now.
Is this sensor compatible with oculus rift? Is there any difference between devises sold by LM on their Webpage and here by amazon?
Hello Kumarswamy, Thank you for the query! The Leap Motion Controller is compatible with the Oculus Rift with the latest release of our V2 SDK. You can view more information on Leap Motion and the Oculus Rift through the following link. https://developer.leapmotion.com/vr In regards to your query regarding the difference between the Leap Motion Device sold on Amazon vs the one we sell on our site, please note that there is no difference. The devices are exactly the same and function in the same manner. Please let us know if you have any remaining questions or concerns.
Will this work on 2DS?
All 3DS games work on the 2DS. So yes, this one does work.
will this work on a Australian 3ds console?
I am pretty sure it won't work on an Australian 3ds console :(
Can I usted tris game in spanish language?
I think you need to set your DS settings to Spanish, the games that have the language will automatically appear in Spanish then.
hello, is multilingual, I need it in Spanish
I do not recall seeing the language option, Jose. I think it may be in English only.
Do the characters speak their lines, or do you need to be able to read?
You need to be able to read
This game is for girls or you can also create a boy protagonist?
It is for any gender. You can make your character either a boy or a girl
Could a child who cannot read yet play this game? Or would it just be frustrating?
A child who couldn't read would be frustrated by this game. 99% of the game is not voice-acted, so they wouldn't understand what was going on. There's a note on the back of the box as well that says reading ability is required to play, which is completely true. The ability to read character dialogue and game menus is absolutely necessary.
Does this work on the Nintendo DS XL?
It will not work on a regular Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS XL, it only works on Nintendo 3DS, 3DS XL, or the Nintendo 2DS systems.
WHARE DO U GET THE AR CARDS
AR cards come with the system when you buy it. Sometimes,but rarely will games come with AR Cards. ( When I say rarely I mean RARELY)
Will this play in 3 DS from UK
No it definitely will not. I hope it will be released for the uk market soon as I bought it for my son and he cannot play it on his machine.

Does the PC DVD version require any downloading or is it all on the DVDs?
Yes it does require an internet connection and the Steam application installed to be able to play the game, even straight out of the box with the CD key. I hope this answer helps you, I did not know that before purchasing and I am unable to play because I do not have an internet connection where I am at this time. Once you are able to get online and activate it with Steam though, apparently you have to set STEAM to offline play (while being online) then afterwards, internet is not required - just activation.
Does the complete edition have all expansion packs included?
Yes that is what complete edition means
Can you download the game via Steam and then play it offline, or does it require you to be connected via steam to even play?
alright the answer to your question is yes. You need access to steam however but you dont need to be connected to the internet. simply open steam in offline mode and go from there. Usually my steam account opens as soon as i log on to my computer then gives me a choice to connect to the internet or continue and open steam in offline mode. Open it in Offline and you can play Civ 5 offline. hope this makes sense
I understand that I need an internet connection to download the game. Can I play the game offline once downloaded on my computer?
You can play offline it just won't be connected to Steam, and a msg will pop up that says Steam won't be able to sync your game files from the cloud. That's the best answer I have from our little experiment we just did by turning off our internet and seeing if our son could still play and he could....Hope it helps!
does this version require me to load it via a cd drive or will it allow me to just download it on steam?
It comes with a cd that you can load the game off of. According to the booklet you don't have to download it via the cd and can just activate it from steam, but I don't have any experience with that so I'm not sure how that would work out for you.
So it looks like there are actually 2 versions of this game. One of them is complete in box and the other requires Steam. Correct?
hi, how i can buy the disc ? i already bought it by download from steam and until now i can not play the game. i asked many questions and tried many ideas to solve my problem but nothing help and steam support not care at all. i just know today how to buy from amazon and send it to my city, so no more steam :)) by disc very easy and better and if have games here reguire to steam i will not buy it
Does it work with Windows 8?
Yes
so this version of the game has no physical manual or map or anything cool for my husband to be giddy over?
This version of the game has a Simple physical manual&#65288;7 page), a page of TECH TREE AND SPECIFIC CHARTS. It has 15 DLC. It need a account of steam. The game program can download in steam, DVD disk can't need. These help to you? if not, Please ask me in simple English again, my English is poor.
Labeled as COMPLETE ED., but does't have EXT. PACKS &amp; DLC as box describes. What do you recommend?
To receive all of the DLC (Brave New World and others) you'll need to activate the CD key through Steam where you will be able to download the game and all of its components. Keep in mind that you will need an account with Steam and have the Steam Client installed.
So if you don't want to use the disk to play you can play via steam right?
I am forced to keep the disk in the drive. There may be a way to play without the disk, but I'm not aware of it.
This item as a combo is $157.99. They are separately (Mouse MX for $67.39 and K800 $64.99) $132.38. Why?
Have the same question. Even Best Buy has them on the store shelves for 69.99 each. And the combo should be significantly less since it probably only has 1 transceiver, and 1 extender cable.
This was ordered for me and came with two cables. One works with the keyboard, but the other one? I need to recharge my mouse, what do I need?
Yes, there are two cables. one is a Unifying receiver extender in case your keyboard and mouse are our of range or your signal is bad because of interference, it is a USB male to female. The other cable is the one you want it is a USB male to Micro male charging cable. To charge the mouse you insert the cable on a SLIGHT angle, it does not go straight in. When you are looking at the mouse the charging cable will be slightly up. Once you do it the first time you will get a feel for it.
Is this keyboard/mouse bluetooth and how is the range on it?Will it work with my dell xps desktop in my equipment closet and i am using it in my theater room?Can it still work if my desktop is in another room?
I just went to my neighbors to type this sentence, 3 walls and 30 feet away,worked fine. It started breaking up at 4 walls and 40 feet away. It is not bluetoothe. It is the standard 2.4 ghz. and works 10 times better than any bluetoothe. I have had absolutely no problems with the unifying adapter. I have accumulated 2 marathon mice, and this keyboard mouse set. The unifying reciever's all work great and brain dead easy to pair up. Love the quite keyboard and smooth feeling keys. I am spoiled with this set. I'm sure it will work with your dell or any computer.
Does this keyboard and mouse only work when your using both? I'd like to use combo at home office, but just use Mouse when going to Corporate offi
Yes, but you will need a logitech unifying receiver (available for under 10 bucks). Logitech is competing with Bluetooth and making there own receivers going away from the universal Bluetooth. On the universal receiver plus side you may have up to 6 devices synchronized. I keep two pointing devices per computer so this works for me. Logitech also claims their own receiver will eliminate the double click problem that occurs with some mice as they get older; but that remains to be seen. If you do not want to buy another receiver you make take the one from home but that defeats the convenience end so just get another receiver. Good Luck.
Can you just use regular AA batteries if you don't want to recharge?
I am sure it will void the warranty.
Is there two charging cables?
that is 1 charging cable do 1 at a time
Is there any noticeable latency when using the keyboard?
My keyboard is relatively close to my computer and I have no latency.
Do the rechargeable batteries 'really' only last 48-hours? (if so, then it's not 'really' wireless)
With moderate to heavy use, I get at least 5 or 6 days out of the mouse before I recharge it. The keyboard will go two weeks or more. Both would surely last much longer if I turned them off when I'm not using them; but I don't. Recharging takes about 20 minutes using the supplied usb cable.
is this android compatible?
Yes.
Can the angle of the keyboard be adjusted?
There are two tabs that flip down to raise the keyboard. But there's only those two angles. Normal height and with the tabs down. Hope that helps
can i play this on my ps3 in the usa
Yes, mine worked just fine!
Does it has a black label or is it greates hits (Red Label)?
It's black label.
is it in english
Yes.
What's the difference of the Prepare to Die Edition and US release Dark Souls?
The prepare to die edition contain the additional content not included with the original release and has an easier system of leveling and player vs player online battles due to enemies dropping more souls. Prepare to die is more than worth the extra dollars. Good day
this CD have the Artoria's expantion?
Yes
subscription required?
Not anymore. Free to play after purchase.
can I only use the code on steam or can I enter it on the ESO website? How big is the download size for this game?
you can use the code on the ESO website or steam the game requires 75 gb free space on HDD to unpack and install and my game takes up 41.6 gb total when finished
If i buy this do i get a gamecode for the tamiel unlimited edition on steam or should i buy a different version
Buy it from Steam or buy it separately, it works the same.
explorers pack still come with this?
No, it doesn't. You have to buy the code online or find an edition that still has it included.
i have an address outside the US can i purchase it and play from another country ?
yes, you can there are two "mega servers" available for play..one in the USA and one in Europe you are able to pick which "mega server" you would like to play on from the "settings" section on the UI btw I play with folks from Germany on the USA server, and some USA players use the mega server in Europe you can only use one at a time however
I bought this on Amazon in December. Digital Download... Where do I download the game, and where do I put my activation code?
steam.
can you use a controller?
There's programs u can get that will allow u to assign commands to controllers yes
does this game works on windows 7 or 8?
Yes, in either 32 or 64 bit versions.
so you get s free 30 days when you buy this? so I dont have to wait to go buy a time card?
I purchased early before game was out and 30 free days were included. I do not know if they are still giving 30 days free now?
What MMO can the game world be compared too? I like big open worlds with little zoning. Vanguard did a good job at this. Rift is 2nd I think.
It's similar to other MMO style games. The game is designed for players who like to explore and quest along the lines of Skyrim. Instead of kill 10 bandits or collect 10 plants objectives the game has you in the role hero wandering around saving individuals, towns, cities and kings. The game is different from other MMO's in that all skills are available. All professions, weapons, armor and skill trees with enough skill points available (a lot of work) to fill them all out on one character. PvP is similar to GW2's eternal battleground open WvWvW with the 3 factions fighting over lots of objectives. ESO's open world PvP is huge, much larger than GW2 even with all 4 zones added together. A lot more fun than GW2 to me, controlling certain scrolls gives PVE bonuses to the whole faction. Fully leveling a character through questing takes you to all 5 zones in all three factions. That's a lot of questing so I can see why players who don't like to quest or enjoy story lines would get bored with the game.

Can I buy this as a gift for a friend or will it automatically try to download to my PC? I want to give the code to someone else.
You can gift the code. Or give the game through Steam.
Will this run on Windows 8.1? I have a Surface Pro 2
Yes. I have a gaming desktop and a laptop, both with Windows 8.1, and Civ 5 runs just fine although I definitely have to play the game at low settings across the board on my laptop. (Intel Core i5 Ivy Bridge, Intel HD Graphics 4400) Looking at the hardware on the Surface Pro 2, it looks like you'll be able to run the game but expect low framerates if you're playing at 1920x1080. I've also noticed better performance running the game in DirectX 9 mode on my laptop as opposed to DirectX 11 so you may want to go that route as well.
What is steam client?
Steam is awesomeness. You sign up for free and if you digital download your game it keeps track of all your games for you. Games take up a lot of memory so you only need to download the games your currently playing. Steam stores the games in the cloud on their servers and you will own the rights to all the games you purchase if your hard drive crashes computer gets stolen doesn't matter not all is lost just sign up new computer and re download games.It's awesome because a steam game has all the software patches and a whole global community that supports and even MODS the games. You can also trade games and gift games you purchase just like you could a hard copy of a game also steam games go on sale all the time your missing out on affordable new games You don't know PC gaming until you join Steam.
I already have CIV V on Steam. Will this install just the content I don't have (e.g. the expansion packs) or will it mess up my current game?
Gill, It appears to install the expansion packs you don't have. The game I had in progress continued from where I had left off, although it was obvious from the opening screenshots that new content had been added overall. Hope this helps.
It says it uses steam for DRM so I cannot play this on the MAC? even though I have steam on my mac?
You can play it on Mac since it has SteamPlay as stated at http://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/.
Once you download the game, can't you just delete steam and continue to play Civ V? You download the whole game onto your computer
No you have to have steam
Can I play this game on a non-gaming laptop that is just a couple years old, or will it run slowly?
Does your laptop have a graphics gard? I suspect you may need dedicated graphics for this one. It runs great on my 2012 laptop; but, I have a Geforce 600 series graphics card installed. If in doubt, you might try www.systemrequirementslab.com, which may be able to give you a preliminary answer.
Where do I download it from once I get the code?
Steam. But yo need to download Steam first
Will this work on my Dell Inspiron laptop?
Yes it should

Do you have to have a 3DS to play this game? Can it be played on the regular DS device?
This game will not work on the regular DS. It will only play on the 3DS or 2DS. (The 2 DS is the flat version that does not have a hinge.)
What type of multiplayer is there? Is there co-op or just Fighters
I believe the only multiplayer is in fighters.
For multiplayer does every need the game, or is this a multiplayer single cartridge game?
Let me answer this carefully. You can play up to four people with ONE cartridge within the Kirby Figthers mode. The other three systems must use the download play feature on their systems but it works and only one cartridge is needed. Each person must have their own system and be in the same room with the one who has the cart in theirs. There is no adventure mode multiplayer so they cannot follow the adventure storyline within the game. Does that help?
Can you have Kirby Triple Deluxe in english or just in japenese?
You can have it in both English & Japanese.
Are the controls easy to learn?
I would say yes. The normal Kirby controls are very basic. You have movement with the analog stick or D-Pad with pressing Up causing Kirby to suck in air and start to fly. A jump button, a "suck" button to draw in the enemies which you can then press Down to gain their powers. That's where the game gets interesting and definitely more complicated. Once an ability has been absorbed the controls change. Your buttons change based on the ability which adds some spice to the game. What's more, if you're getting confused about the controls you can always check the bottom screen for information about how your abilities work.
Does this game have a campaign/story mode like Nightmare in Dreamland or is it just minigames?
This game has a campaign/story mode like Nightmare in Dreamland.
Does this game run at 60 FPS?
Yes
can you play this on a 3 DS XL
Yes
Will a 19 year older enjoy this game? If so, how fun is it? And approximately, how many total hours does it take to complete the game?
This game may be a bit tame for a 19 year old at first. It does unlock some extra challenges near the end for more advanced players, but this would be best for either younger children or teens, or older players with nostalgia for the original Kirby games for NES and SNES. The main game itself can be beaten in about 8-10 hours give or take.
Is this kirby in Chinese or in English
English

Once an ability has been absorbed the controls change. Your buttons change based on the ability which adds some spice to the game. What's more, if you're getting confused about the controls you can always check the bottom screen for information about how your abilities work.
Does this game have a campaign/story mode like Nightmare in Dreamland or is it just minigames?
This game has a campaign/story mode like Nightmare in Dreamland.
Does this game run at 60 FPS?
Yes
can you play this on a 3 DS XL
Yes
Will a 19 year older enjoy this game? If so, how fun is it? And approximately, how many total hours does it take to complete the game?
This game may be a bit tame for a 19 year old at first. It does unlock some extra challenges near the end for more advanced players, but this would be best for either younger children or teens, or older players with nostalgia for the original Kirby games for NES and SNES. The main game itself can be beaten in about 8-10 hours give or take.
Is this kirby in Chinese or in English
English
A weird question but did anyone get a game manual in their case....It dumb but it always bothers me when I get a new game and there's just the disc
Yeah, the US release does not have a manual, shame I know, but the game itself shows you detailed instructions for modes and options anyways.
Will this game include all the DLC?
It will, but not all at once. From the EU version, it seems like Campaign Pack 1 (with Shigechi and Kira) is already out, while Campaign Pack 2 will be out May 14, most likely including Fugo and Iggy. It seems like they're going the same route as the JP version did by releasing DLC with their respective campaigns every 2-3 weeks.
Will the game is in Spanish?
I haven't seen anything on the game that says it's in spanish. I've only noticed it being japanese voice with english subs with no options to change it in the settings menu.
For the North America pre-order of the game, was amazon supposed to give both the Shigechi &amp; Kira DLC? I only received an email for Shigechi
The Amazon pre-order unfortunately only gives you Shigechi. In order to have gotten Kira DLC you would have had to prs-order from namco bandais website.
my copy of the game did not come with a playing manual, is this normal ?
Yes, unfortunately a lot of modern games nowadays are trying to push to digital downloads because it is cheaper, that is why there is such a limited copy of ASB, and also why the game has the safety information printed on the cover.
I pre-ordered this game back in February but I never got the PSN code for Shigechi. Did anybody else have this problem?
Amazon e-mailed me the code about a day or two before release date. I pre-ordered the game around March. If you ordered from Amazon, check your spam folder or old e-mail.
Did they change the North American box art? This one looks way worse
Well, it looks like it, I liked the JP cover too, and I though it was gonna be like that, but nope. It looks good to me though anyways. (Would be nice if they have reverse cover art or something.) &gt;_&gt;
How many GBs does it need to install?
Its mandatory and about/around 2GB.
Did anyone else have issues with Campaign mode? I got the game on day 1 and it requires campaign 1 data but it wont download. It's not there on PSN
Well, from what I read, Bamco mentioned that they already fixed the issue with the DLC codes and the Campaign stuff not working. And yes, its still there on the PSN store for this game if you mean looking for the campaign data.
What english sub is better? US or UK/EU? I mean, in the way JoJo is. Good translated in dialogues. By the way Is it in Spanish or not???
Licensing issues most likely thats the problem the series
Is this headset comfortable for wearer of glasses?
Yes, I wear glasses/have worn glasses my entire life and the headset is more comfortable than any other headphones/headset I've had.
Will this Sentry work with Skype?
Hi, Yes work this Gaming Headset Sentey with Skype , not problem at all
For the harmoniq pro version of this headset what does "Not Virtual" mean as opposed to "Virtual". Does that mean there's no surround sound
Hi , it support Real 5.1 Surround sound because comes with 6 real drivers, 3 drivers each side, including subwoofer. The virtual surround is created by software and not by the speakers/drivers , in this Headset not need any software to got surround because has a 6 physical drivers , 3 in each side/ear.....
Does this headset work with consoles and does the mic work in game with consoles like, ps3/4, xbox ?
Hi , No it is only for PC, works in all the functions only with computers
Does anyone know if a gaming mouse will fit into the space between the headphoens in the carrying case? Has anyone tried it?
Oh yes. The case is very roomy.
Does this headset with the PS4 or Xbox One?
Yes the Sentey headset works with either of them
Hey, sorry, I couldn't find this answer in the description... does this headset come with extra ear cushions?
Yes, it comes with two sets. A leatherette and foam set.
Does this work with the xbox 360?
I hoped for it to work with my xbox as well pc. But when I plug in the headset to the xbox360 my xbox fails and freezes as I think it just cant handle it as its taking to much battery or something or could be the software etc. But I have one of the first xboxs so it might just be the originals and maybe an xbox elite could handle it but mine cant.
Does this require software, and is it compatible with Mac?
Hi works in mac but not the software
Is this headset necessarily better than all the other ones especially Symph? I'm stuck between Harmoniq, Symph, and Vibros.
Hi.! Harmoniq Pro is top of the level because them comes with 6 real drivers , 3 on each ear, so the 5.1 is this headset is real with 5 real drivers + 1 subwoofer real, not virtual by software, in the Symph and Vibros the 7.1 are Virtual not real, is it made by software, the sound quality in the Harmoniq is very very high compared with Symph and Vibros. This 2 are not bad, but Harmoniq are top level.
do you need audio in and audio out ports or does the mic work along with headphones in one port?
Hi, This headset is USB so do not comes any 3.5mm Plug to connect, its only for Pc Computers.
Does the microphone fold up?
yes, right
Is the item durable?
Absolutely, the good thing about this specific model is it will not press around your ear, I mean the headphone is evenly flat around your ear so there is no uncomfortable spot around your ear.
What are the "Deluxe Premium" items? Specifically the Carrying Case, Deluxe User Manual, Premium Packaging, Door Hanger, and VIP CARD.
The box is very nice. it's lined, and has a flop-over section that keeps it shut. Nice storage for the headphones, but I use it for other things....it's that nice. User manual? Eh...just big. Other stuff is nerd-riffic! If you are not into gaming, it's nothing special.
Is there any way to turn down the headset on the ps3? It is so loud, but not on the computer.
there is a volume control on the headset although I use it on my PC. I have a feeling it would still work for PS3. Hope this helps.
Is the Microphone flexible or does it just rotate?
swivels up and down to out of way and is flexible boom
im gonna get this for a friend if it works on xbox 360 theres like 4 usb slots on it and he really needs a new mic so does it work with 360?
Unfortunately it won't work the 360. The mic for the 360 works through the controller with a small cable that plugs in the bottom. You won't be able to hear either so it won't work with the 360 at all. The 360 lacks the necessary software drivers to run the sound.
do it work with mac
Works fine on my 2009/2010 macbook pro, so you should be good to go
Will they work for ps3?
I don't have a PS3 but I can tell you that it only has a USB.
I this mac/osx compatible
I do not think so. I only have a PC, but the box and instructions only address the PC and say system requirements == Windows 8, 7, and Vista.
Will be able to see the coaches celebrations? Specially "el piojo" Herrera coach from mexico celebration
I used the USA and Germany so far and both coaches celebrated the same way (nothing unique) so I'm assuming Piojo would not celebrate like he would in real life.

Yes it is.
What CECH model is this PS3?
4201C
which thing is included with this console?
The PS3 slim console, one black wireless controller with charging cable, and The Last of Us game. HDMI cable NOT included.
can Ps2 games be palyede in this Ps3
No.
Do these suffer from the yellow light of death? My fat MGS4 ps3 just died.
I haven't had any issues yet, other than an occasional sound bug where it will go in and out, where I have to restart the system. no yellow light of doom just yet, but i've only had it for a few weeks now, hopefully that doesn't arrive to my console. you can definitely tell a difference in quality from the original ps3s tho. this one feels kinda cheap. it has a sliding door for the disks where as the other one was built kinda like the ps4. in retrospect id rather have the old style ps4. it was sleeker and didn't look and feel as cheap
Any idea why the 500gb with Last of Us is cheaper than the 250gb Last of Us bundle as well as the standard 500gb slim?
I was surprised by that too. I don't really know why that is the case. If I were to guess they may have stopped production of those models (the 250gb Last of Us and the 500gb slim). Since there are less of those models in the wild now Amazon may be pricing them higher. That was my reasoning but I don't have any definitive information.
Is it dual voltage, 110-120 or 220-240?
110-120
Can I play 3D games on this PS3 console?
Yes
Does this come from steam? I would really appreciate a big icon telling us where these games come from.. I don't want STEAM..had nothing but bad luck.
DRM is Uplay. The DRM is mentioned under the product title.
Can this be played with a keyboard and a mouse? Or is it best suited for gamepads?
It's super easy to play with a keyboard and mouse. There were even times where i would lay down while I played. You only use about 6 buttons on the keyboard, and they are all pretty close to each other. If you don't already have a gamepad, i would suggest not getting one for this game.
Can I purchase this game for my son and forward or have the code sent to him?
Yes
Is the game's software eventually downloaded to my PC for off-line play, or must I always be on the web?
You must play on-line by UPLAY.
Can this game be installed on multiple computers? My sister and I both want to play.
I don't think so because you have to make a uplay account so that would mean only one saved game but you can always finish the game first and then you can delete your file to your sister can play.
The stardust pack, is that just permanent stat upgrades?
Yes

Will this Remote work for with the Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Intant Video Apps on the Xbox ONE?
It currently works with all video apps except for Youtube. The Media Remote will launch the Youtube app if you select it but it won't let you scroll through videos or play anything once you're in the app. To actually use the app, you need to use your controller, at least until Google updates the Youtube app itself for compatibility with the Media Remote.
Does the remote stay "on", or will it shut itself off like the controller?
It's like a regular TV remote (it's only "on" when it transmits a signal). The only difference is that if you move it the buttons light up.
Does it uses battery or is rechargeable???
It uses batteries, although I use rechargeable ones.
Does this remote work in the Media Player App and/or the official Plex app? I understand it works with Netflix and other similar apps already.
It works the same as a controler just with out ABYX buttons it has a ok and back button arrows and basics play functions.
Can I use this remote to instantly turn off the XBOX One when my son refuses to stop playing?
You can use the remote but it is not instant. You hold the button and a message comes up and you have to arrow up to "turn off console". Not instant but pretty quick.
do you need a kinect to use any of the remotes funtions?
No. Just the xbox one.
Do the up and down arrows to the right of the volume change the channel?
Yeah they change the channel. Do different things depending on application too
Can you use the remote to change the source input on your receiver?
No, not that I am aware of. And with the lack of CEC-HDMI capability, it is doubtful. The current IR blaster support for receivers is very basic.
Does this controller connect to a Windows PC (like the Xbox 360 media remote)?
No, this works using IR and only communicates with Xbox One right now
I'll be hooking up the Tivo through the HDMI pass through. Can this remote be programmed to control the Tivo Box as well?
It will control any features that the Xbox One can control on the Tivo. So, if the TV app has been set up to control the box, and you can control play/pause, fast forward, and rewind with the Xbox, then the remote can control those features as well. The only difference I have noticed is, you will sometimes have to press the select button after the action button - so to fast forward, you will press the fast forward key (which will show the Xbox controls, with the fast forward option highlighted) then press the select button to send the fast forward command to the box.
Can I hear the gameplay sound with this?
Yep you can. Good luck.
Would this work with any headphones like beats or apple headphones?
Yes, it will provide game and chat audio to any headphones, however you can't chat back without a mic in the headphones
Hello. I have both a PS4 and Xbox One. I was given the PS4 Gold Headset for a present. I was curious would this work with them? Thank you.
Yes I have s gold headset and use it for both consoles. With the ps4 it is completely wireless and with the xbox one you'll need to plug the headset into the controller adaptor, so while for the xbox it's not totally wireless it still requires no connection to the console itself.
Will this work with my Astros A50s which have a 2.5mm jack?
Yes it will. I use my TB XP500 using this adapter and a 2.5mm cable which I had to buy separate. I believe your A50's already have the cable so you would be set. Enjoy the way your headset's were meant to be used, finally.
will this work on ps4?
No only Xbox one controllers
Will this adapter provide the audio from Netflix or the TV app too? Or Just game audio
Yes it's going to provide audio from any app you open in the xbox one.
Can the xbox one headphone wire be replace.
No it can not just so they could make extra money on product sales
Considering buying V-MODA Crossfade LP and BoomPro mic. Worried that the mic will be too loud or too quiet. Can Xbox adjust the mic perfectly?
The only mic volume that you can adjust is the one from other people that are talking to you. I don't know if you can change how loud your mic is though.
Will this work with the SteelSeries Siberia v2s that have 2 3.5mm jacks(Output and Input)?
The device itself only has 1 3.5mm jack that handles all input and output, so out of the box: No. You would only be able to connect 1 3.5mm cable. However, you may be able to find 3.5mm joiners that can combined the two cables into 1. You have to research and make sure you get an adapter with enough contacts in the right spots to ensure everything gets joined and sent through properly.
Looks like just what I need! But why does it come with a USB cable? It doesn't seem as if it would need one.
Some controllers, such as both of mine, require a quick process of updating your controller. It's quite simple. 1. Place adapter on controller and turn on controller. 2. Plug in headphones. You'll be prompted if firmware is needed along with the following steps. 3. Plug the Micro USB cord into the back of your xbox and to your controller. 4. Wait 5. When finished it'll ask if you would like to do another controller, go ahead do them all and be done with it. Whole process took me about 2-4 minutes and that's never have had done it before and doing 2 controllers. Quite easy and on screen prompts tell you everything you need. Big kudos to MS for making what could be a real pain in the butt into something easy and nearly idiotproof.
Does the headset require Microsoft's stereo headset adapter that's $25?
Yes the headphones require Microsoft's adapter.The adapter is included though.
does the audio from your television, redirected into this headset once plugged in and setup?
No, the audio plays on the headset and television simultaneously. I find myself turning the television volume all the way down so you can't hear it anymore and just using the headset. It sure helps when don't want to wake anyone up at night.
Can you hear your own voice when you speak ? (Like on Turtle Beaches, you can hear yourself through your own headset to allow voice moderation)
No you can't. You do miss that feature when you are used to it.
Can you use two of these at the same time with the same Xbox One console?
You can actually use as many as you have controls. The headset plugs directly into the control so it uses the same signal.
Would I be able to hear regular tv with these headphones? Does it only work for games or can I also listen to apps like Netflix and Youtube etc.?
Yes, you can hear all apps and tv.
Does this require batteries or is it rechareable through the Xbox One?
It just plugs into your controller. No extra batteries needed
Does this work with pc?
The nice thing about this headset is that is has a standard headphone jack. You can use it with your PC no prob. Great for Skype too
Does the set come with a mic monitor (or the ability to hear yourself speak from the mic)
It does not come with a mic monitor and you cannot hear yourself thru the mic when you speak. Sorry.
Are there over-ear? And how do the build quality and sound quality stack up against a mid-range turtle beach headset?
They cup over the ear but do not match the intense sound of turtle beach. I have an inexpensive set of turtle beach (X12) and the work great with the xb one. You do have to purchase the Xbox earphone adapter though. Don't pay more than 25 bucks..shop around.
Can I use this headset for voice chat only? (Game Sounds still coming out of the tv.)
Yes you can... the adapter has buttons where you can adjust the percentage of voice/game volume. If you hit the voice button until it beeps, you will only hear voice :)
Does this game have a multiplayer mode?
no...just single
Can you download to WiiU console? Our disc keeps freezing up.
I don't think you can. Your wii probably needs to be shut down or reset. When you open the cover there should be a red button just push it and it should reset the console. It shouldn't delete anything. If not then the disc needs to be cleaned.
Can you use a gun to play the game?
Yes you can I haven't tried yet but it says its compatable
do you need a gun to play this game?
No you dont you can play with the game pad an wii/nun chuck.
does this come with a gun?
No it doesn't just the game disc
is the xbox works on 110 or 220 volts?
can the xbox one work in the uk ?considering their current
Do I need an HD tv for an Xbox One?
Yes and no. Let me explain. The Xbox One only comes with an HDMI out. However, you can purchase cables/converters that will go HDMI-&gt; component or standard A/V. I can't recommend any b/c I don't have any personal experience with them but if you search on Amazon you'll find plenty. But keep in mind the Xbox One is geared toward HD content and games. If you don't use an HD TV you are not getting the full benefit of the console. It would be like buying a sports car and never driving over 40 MPH. If you are going to shell out the almost $500.00 for the Xbox One then you owe it to yourself to upgrade your TV too. HD content will become the norm. Lastly, as of now most of the games for the One are being produced for the 360, which does have standard outputs. So if you don't have a HD TV now stick with the 360 and wait till you upgrade your TV. Also, if you look there are very few One games out now. Over the next few months more will be coming out but there is a very small pool of One games. So you may be better off waiting till you upgrade your TV to buy a One anyway. Hope this helps.
will x box 360 games play in it
Hi danny, unfortunately....xbox one only accepts xbox one games. We cannot play xbox 360 games on it.
Can I use my 360 controllers with the new system? Thanks!
sadly you can't. The Titanfall bundle only comes with one Xbox One controller, but currently that's all you'll need since there aren't too many multiplayer Xbox One games available yet. I ordered a second controller on Amazon for the future but still haven't needed to open it. Hope this helps
does this come with the hdmi cable?
It does! I was actually surprised that it did.
How large is the internal hard drive?
500 GB
I want to know if NSA could spy inside my home thanks to the Kinnecht apparatus. Thanks.
If you believe the NSA can spy on you through your kinect than you would be foolish not to believe the NSA cannot spy on you through your cell phone or laptop camera. In other words, if you own a smart phone I think a kinect is the least of your worries... Nice try though.
i have free games downloaded from the xbox360 is thereany way to transfer them to the xbox one?
Unfortunately right now that is a no. I did read that Microsoft is working on backwards compatibility.
does it have blu ray
Yes
Does XBox One absolutely need internet? Or can it be used offline because my internet isn't the best.
It does not need internet, they changed the format when people started complaining. It is best to use internet so you can play multiplayer games.
does it work with mac
It does, I have a Mac myself and my only problem was the shift key doesn't work with Mac so you have to use the control key as a shift button. Other than that it's a great key board for Mac.
I'm trying to decide between this and the CM Storm Devastator Bundle (the mouse is not a deciding factor). Which one would you choose?
Dear Angelpunk18, we can recommend our keyboards, but you choose any of it which you are prefer to.Thank you.
I can see it doesn't have dedicated media keys, but does this keyboard have shortcuts for them? also how even is the LED backlight?
Dear Angelpunk18, yes it has the shortcut Fn+F6 and you can Press Fn+Esc to adjust the brightness. Thank you.
How compatible is this keyboard with Macs?
Dear Jeffrey W, yes ,it is compatible with Macs. Thank you.
how do i change into nkro mode...bios is not recognizing??
This keyboard doesn't have an nkro mode to my knowledge....in the vast majority of cases, NKRO is PS/2 only, while this is a USB board
So, this keyboard doesn't have those stands in the back? So is it just FLAT on your desk? Isn't that uncomfortable?
No it doesn't which is the only thing wrong with this keyboard. The keys are comfortable and we love it even without the stands
Does it have a good key response? I know it's not a mechanical one, but I like the mechanical, how does this compare?"
It has good key response! No problems with this keyboard at all!
USA doesn't use the metric system (although we should) what are the dimensions in inches please?

it works for an US ps3 console?? thanks..
yes the UK PS3 version is fully compatible with the USA PS3 console, but you may need an HD hook-up (HDMI) connection to your screen. (just to note that the UK 360 version is region locked and cant be used on a US 360 console)
Is this game in English?
Yes
Whats the difference between MX GP and MX GP 14?
I thing mxgp 14 is the US version. Mxgp originally released in Europe.
Can this game be played on a Australian PS3 console?
It should be okay to play in your country. I live in the U.S. and I bought the game from the U.K. Worked fine. I don't think Playstation has zone restrictions like XBOX does.
I would like to know if this game it is compatible with PS3 console sold in US?
yes sure %

You could play 2 vs 2 but the game is only 2 players. It work by you and a friend fight together with computers or fight each other with a computer partner. And if you want a 1 vs 1 press the triangle button on the square where you pick a character. If not then a computer will still be there. I hope I explained this well to you.

I know this has cross-save with PS3, but does it have cross-PLAY. I.e. can my friend and I play _together_ on the PS3 and Vita?
No. The reason it's not included is because the Vita version has a different enemy count per location you visit (a smaller number of baddies so the system can handle it).
never played this is this a shooter? or rpg?
It is both. A shooter with rpg elements such as health and a very robust looting system. Millions of different guns generated randomly.
How much memory card space is required for the Add-On Content? Is it included on the cartridge or a download from PSN?
It's a Download from the PSN store with a voucher code included. It took up roughly 1.5-2 gb that I had to clear some room for.
Are the "6 Add-Ons" on the game card or PSN downloads?
They are available as a voucher code in the game case. They require to be downloaded from PSN.
What was sacrificed to place this on the PS-Vita? - Frame Rate - Number of Co-op/Multi-Player Users at once - Image Quality - Load Times etc
Load times are not bad. Frame rate drops some. I don't play multiplayer so I dont know if it reduces the number. Its better on console, but all in all a very enjoyable vita game.
Any news on how much space is needed for the RETAIL copy? I'm hoping I can /just make it/ with my 4GB card!
Retail copy only requires 10 mb unless you want to download the extra content. There are 2 large downloads the come with the voucher code but the rest are tiny. I would say total you would need at least 1.5-2 gb to get everything.
Is there a disc version available? Huge bl fan and i have this version via psn download but would like disc as backup.
Only have the download code with the DLCs. The code was from a Borderlands PS Vita bundle. Sorry I don't have what you're looking for.
Can you play with 2 controllers and split-screen co-op on one television with a PS TV?
i dont think so
can you play this game on the vita and invite/join people playing this on the pc?
No, the only cross platform functionality for this game is being able to transfer a save from PS3 to Vita and Vita to PS3
Will the dlc from the Vita version carry on to the PS3 version if I don't have any of the dlc on it?
No
why does it say "Batteries 2 AA batteries required."? never seen a wired mouse that needs batteries, could that be a mistake?
It's a mistake. This does not require any batteries
Does the middle mouse button (scroll wheel) depress easily? That's the one thing I didn't like about my MX518, it felt mushy at times.
It's easy to press, but it's also nice and firm. You won't be accidentally pressing it down unless you have a finger made of lead; it also has a nice, muffled click when you press it down. By far my favorite mouse wheel.
Can you reprogram all the buttons or are some of the buttons fixed so they only control the DPI or switch the profile?
You can reassign every button on this mouse (even the DPI buttons) except for the toggle button that controls the wheel functionality. The mouse's wheel can toggle between hyper scroll mode (where you can spin the wheel and it keeps spinning freely) and regular notched scroll mode. The button that toggles this mouse wheel functionality is specifically used for that purpose only.
Is this compatible with Mac?
The mouse will work with Mac. I use a Mac at work and a PC at home. From my PC at home I can program the DPI settings and save them into one of the profile slots on the mouse so that they will be the same on my Mac at work. However, you will not be able to program the button functions for the mouse through the Logitech software on the Mac. Some of the buttons are programmable via the Mac preferences pane but I've found that the Mac doesn't seem to pick up the left and right scrollwheel buttons. The DPI shift button works as expected though. Also, i want to point out that the Logitech G software does have a Mac version. And I am able to program my Logitech g500 and g602 mouse with it. My guess is that the surface calibration feature of the g502 is the thing that's holding Logitech back from making this fully compatible with Mac. They've been progressively making their other G mice mac compatible over the past couple of years. So hopefully the g502 will be added to that list at some point as well.
If anybody plays CS:GO with this mouse ---- When flick-sniping or playing scoutzknives, is the scroll-wheel accurate? Does 1 notch switch ONE weapon?
One notch switches one weapon. In "locked" mode, it's quite sturdy indeed and there's next to no chance of you actually scrolling the thing. In free scroll mode though, it's extremely loose and sometimes even picking up the mouse is enough to make the scroll move.
Can you change the color of the lights?
No, the light cannot be changed. They can be turned off though.
Is this really a worthy successor to the G500?
Yes. I thought nothing was going to be able to replace my G500 when it stopped working. The ergonomics were literally perfect for my hand, the free scrolling wheel, braided cable and the customizable weights. My G502 literally does all of that, just better. Word of caution though, as I was used to the G500 which is noticeably bigger than the 502 (and I have relatively small hands), you won't necessarily fall in love with it immediately. After about a week or so of use and the ergonomics will start to make sense. Once that happens, it becomes better than the 500.
How is there 11 programmable buttons? I only see G-keys 4-9.
All the buttons can be reassigned, including the tilt wheel. So, 11 buttons total, all of them programmable.
Do you think g502 is better than Deathadder Chroma? (I'm playing BF4)
g502 is better in every way unless you prefer the deathadder shape or slightly lighter weight. g502 has better sensor (native at every step), build quality, software (if wanted) more buttons, features, and better customer support.
Can the Back and Forward buttons be customized to do in-game actions like throwing a grenade?
Yes in the logitech software you can change tje action of the buttons. You van use the two buttons in the left side too. I use one to melee attack and the other for throwing grenades
dose the built in wifi have to be hooked up to wifi or dose it make its own
Depending on the WiFi network you are trying to attach to, you may or may not need a network key to attach. The console itself doesn't create a WiFi to hook up to. No extra devices are needed to use the WiFi feature other than having wireless internet at home or wherever the intended location may be. You can also use a wired connection with an Ethernet cable, sold separately I'm sure. Hope that answers your question.
Can I connect it to my regular, old flat screen tv? I'm not exactly sure, but most prob it does not have HDMI
I would check the back of the TV or the sides, for any HDMI slots. If it has HDMI slots, you can connect your XBOX 360 E using an HDMI cable. If your TV does not have any HDMI slots, this bundle actually includes a 'regular, non HDMI' cable. Neither PS3s or Xbox360s come with HDMI cables included. :)
are the games downloads or disks, and does it need internet to play the games
The downloads come from the internet, but the discs are personally purchased. No Internet is needed for the discs.
Will this xbox take wired controllers and how many??
It looks like 2 from best I can tell. We found wireless ones almost same price so went that way.
if I buy the 360 E can I put the bigger hard drive from my original 360 on it
No, you cant.
the price is 199.99?
The price will vary by seller.
Is the Borderlands 2 Games on Demand download card transferable? I'm not interested in this game. Can I give it away to a friend?
Yes
How many USB ports does the 360 E have?
Two, I'm pretty sure. It's at least that much
which is the date of manufacture?
2014-07-12
can this play original xbox games
certain games are backwards compatible but in my opinion it doesn't work that well.
Has anyone bought &amp; downloaded this game for a new MAC Air? Does it work correctly? Any issues?
I downloaded it to my new pro, and a friend has it on his air. Runs flawlessly on both.
Does this work with Mac OS Mavericks? If so, how smoothly?
Sure does, running it right now. If you're loading up a big game it'll be a little slow to start but I've found that to be the case regardless of platform or OS. Hope this helps
do i need steam to play this? or i can just launch this game by itself?
You need Steam to download the program and get any updates. They also seem to force you to check in with them every once in a while, since the program occasionally will not work until you do. However, you can play the game off line. What I do is turn WiFi off before I boot Civilization V. This allows you to play the game without being connected to Steam.
Can I run this without Stream? I install stream, bring up client window and I get the spinning wheel and eventually have to force quit.
You cannot. Moreover, you cannot run it offline.
Does this work with Mac os Yosemite?
Yes! I play with yosemite all the time
What does "Online Game Code" mean? Is the complete version download to my MAC or must I be connected to the Internet to play the game?
I've played the game offline dozens of times, though it does prefer you to be online for cloud based save file storage (in offline mode it saves a local copy). When I bought the game i was emailed a "Product Code" to activate it. Searching online I found answers that Amazon emails you the Online Game Code to activate the game. It basically means you're getting the game's activation code by email rather than printed and mailed to you.
How do I download this to my Mac? I received it as a gift so I did not buy the game myself, but I have the code and am just not sure where to enter it
You have to download Steam (free) and input your code through there.

Do the paddle shifters actually work?
yes, the paddle shifters works well in Forza 5
it does come with the pedals, right?
Yes it does
will this clamp to a desk?
This was a present for my 10 year old and decided to get one of those adjustable stands that it mounts too. It's works well! You can mount to a desk but it will probably need a base then the base can mount to the desk. There are pre tapped holes in the bottom for screws to go into.
Wheel will not steer, but the buttons and pedals work.. Help?
The instruction manual that came with the wheel should tell you how to re-calibrate it, but if you don't have it, here is the link to Thrustmasters website and the pdf file for the instruction manual to troubleshoot and re calibrate the Ferrari 458 Spider wheel for Xbox One. Only the first half of the first page is the english instructions, all the rest of the file is for other languages. You will have to enlarge it in order to read it. Hope this helps. http://ts.thrustmaster.com/download/accessories/Manuals/Ferrari_458_Spider/F458_Spider_User_Manual.pdf
is this can use for PC?
No, it's for an xbox one
can i drift on that in forza horizon 2 ?
IT work real good but real sensitive
Does this product work with Xbox ONE and does it support the game Project CARS
Yes
Has anyone had any problems with the gas pedal? Ours is not responding. Any tips? I am about to return it. So frustrating.
Having problems with the gas pedal as well. If it doesn't start working as advertised, Im sending it back.
can you use the th8a add on shifter and the tp3a add on for this wheel????
Don't mind these guys, they haven't done their research. The TP3A pedals work (as confirmed by Thrustmaster themselves), but the TH8A shifter does not as it requires a certain port that is only on the Thrustmaster TX. The TH8A does come with a USB cable but it will not work through the USB ports of the Xbox One. Hope I was of some help!
Can you change the gas and brake to the shifters behind the wheel in the controls options. I am in wheelchair and cant use pedals.
Yes, you can in Forza Horizon 2. In the CONTROL settings, you have 5 different preset configurations. It's 'Default Layout 5'
Considering buying this item, but had a compatibility question. Box states that it works with 3DS, does it also work with 3DS XL and 2DS? Thanks!
Yes sir, it works with all systems in the 3ds family. Power saves actually never touches the 3ds unit, instead works by using the power saves to plug the cartridge into the computer and then use the software to modify the games existing save file. A way too look at the device is it's built similarly to a SD card reader, but instead for 3ds games.
does the 3ds action replay work on games downloaded onto the system? or do you have to have the game card for the game?
It only works when you have the game card.
Does this work with the New 3DS XL?
Yes, since the new 3DS can still run 3DS games it should always work. The action replay powersaves only edits with your computer on applying codes inside the game cartridges.
Do this product works properly with Mac?
Unfortunately not. We had to use a PC, which was BootCamp on a Mac for us.
Will this work with Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire?
Yes it works with the new games
Is this completely safe to use? The 3DS specifically states that unauthorized use may cause the 3DS to become bricked. Has anyone had this happen?
The cartridge is one thing the console that's another story, the one taking the code modification is the cartridge not the 3DS. So if you was to corrupt data on something it would be the game, and the Game saves has a backup feature that can undo something. So you can have fun just don't over do it, let it do what you tell it to. Once it's done don't pull the cartridge out, exit the software then pull the cartridge out keep it simple.
will this record game video?
This is not a video game recorder or streaming device. This is a device that can back up your existing 3DS save files onto a computer, and then you can edit those save files to change the data in your game.
will this product work for me in australia?
Yes. it's English version only, but not regional games from another country.
I saw one review saying that this may only work for UK versions of games, is that true?
Powersave PRO got License key which should be US. Some may be EU keys instead of US which is why it sometimes works for others with this product. Regular Powersave (yellow package) should have License key for EU, in this case, for UK. If your license key is from the other region, you can contact Datel to change the license key's currently region (EU &lt;-&gt; US) to the other. Website: https://powersaves3ds.maximummemory.com/support/
Can you use .sav files with this?
nope. don't see an option to do that from the interface. The save file option are save files stored in the action replay servers
I was thinking about buying a couple of this game as gifts, it won't be an issue will it? The recipients won't have any problem using the game codes?
Yes, when you buy it you get an unused game code. The person receiving the code just needs to make an NCSoft Account and redeem the code on their site.
Will I be able to redeem the code for the deluxe version after June 3, 2015? Not going to be able to download the game, or register, for 5+ months.
Yeap, it's just a code. They will just discontinue to sell them as it gives a few extras :)
If you buy this before the game comes out, does it count as a pre-order, so you can get the bonuses?
The bonuses are mostly access to the closed betas (now over) and registering you guild and character name (currently going on till the 23rd). Other than that you get three day early head start. But yes, if you order now you'll get what bonuses remain. Regular vs. deluxe determine what in-game loot you get. Visit the game's website to see the differences. Cheers!
Is this game one pay only or needs a subscription later? If it does, how much it is montly?
It's a subscription required game. It's about $15 (USD) per month with a declining scale if you subscribe at 3, 6, etc months. You get the first 30 days free though.
How do you get theThree Guest Passes with seven days of play time that come with this edition?
They come with purchase and were sent to my email sometime after the official launch. If you purchased this and are expecting passes but haven't received them, I recommend contacting WildStar customer support.
Is the extra 20 buck for the deluxe edition of the game worth it?
Probably not. But you get some nice mounts. A rocket house. couple of housing items. some dyes and costume. Titles. To me.. I bought the deluxe version to save me the time of grinding money to get a mount. The ones you get you cannot use till level 25. they are giving a way a mount right now if you sign up for 2-step login verification. you cam use right away

Does this version come with the new pre-order rewards?
You get everything except for a title, green dye, and a hoverboard.
So in order to gift this, I just email the person the code? That's it?
I would assume so. they email you the code. Then your friend should be able to make their own account w/ their email.
well, no one talks about monthly fees, are there any, if so how much is it? or how does it work? or its free to play
yes $14.99 per month. don't know if u buy more then 1 month will price go down. u can also get in game $$$ buy selling your monthly fee or if u have enough in game $$$ u can buy a monthly fee.
On the Wildstar website, it states that the game comes with 3 7 day guest passes. Does this download give the same guest passes?
It sure does! They'll email the passes to you after a couple days and then you're free to send them to your friends.
Is this just a code or will any portion of the game files be downloadable from amazon? I am having a great deal of trouble using NCsofts client.
It's is just a registration code to give you access to the game. You use the code on the WildStar website and then download the game.
I am temporarily living in Europe. If I buy the US version, can I download and play on US servers from Europe?
Yes, in fact it's the only way to play on US servers. If you buy a code from one of their European gates, or even through a European amazon gate, it will only be good for Euro servers. I bought a code on US amazon for a friend in Europe and we play together on US servers.
I have the new Mac Pro. Could I play this using Parallels?
My best friend is an all mac guy and I'm afraid he's not going to be able to play WildStar at all. They definitely won't have mac support at release. I have read several forum entries that say don't try to play Wildstar on Parallels because the delay on the MAC is overwhelming. I know some people are now trying to setup Bootcamp and make it work but it doesn't sound positive. I would definitely wait till Carbine comes out with a MAC client..
i hace a laptop dv6 i7 2.oo ghz, 8 gb ram, ati radeon hd 6770m, can play this game?
You'll be able to play it. Probably not not on full specs. Your RAM and GPU are fine, but a 2.0GHz processor is a bit slow. If you have the i7 it probably has TurboBoost. You should check out what the max speed is with the boost, if it's above 2.4 you can definitely play it. If not you will probably have too low of a framerate for this game, it requires a lot of aiming and avoiding, which gets tough at low FPS.
Does this version come with the new pre-order rewards?

My best friend is an all mac guy and I'm afraid he's not going to be able to play WildStar at all. They definitely won't have mac support at release. I have read several forum entries that say don't try to play Wildstar on Parallels because the delay on the MAC is overwhelming. I know some people are now trying to setup Bootcamp and make it work but it doesn't sound positive. I would definitely wait till Carbine comes out with a MAC client..
i hace a laptop dv6 i7 2.oo ghz, 8 gb ram, ati radeon hd 6770m, can play this game?
You'll be able to play it. Probably not not on full specs. Your RAM and GPU are fine, but a 2.0GHz processor is a bit slow. If you have the i7 it probably has TurboBoost. You should check out what the max speed is with the boost, if it's above 2.4 you can definitely play it. If not you will probably have too low of a framerate for this game, it requires a lot of aiming and avoiding, which gets tough at low FPS.
Will this game work on an American PS3?
Yes
What are the teams like? Are there only Test teams, and who are the players?

No I you can't
Does this support co op? Playing two players against each other offline?
It supports up to 2 players either in the same room or via network play. It is a UK game though, so in order to support network play between 2 players a buyer would have to create a second PSN Network account under the U.K. network rather than the U.S. network if he doesn't already have a U.K. network account. it's free to do so.

does it fit to the ps4?
You can use it to replace the sticks on the ps4 controller. See how here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXyoH50xteE .
shipping to argentina? how much?
It is about $5 and
Do these have any play to them? I've looked at several different reveiws and can't figure out if they actually have a deadzone or not.
J. Yuan is very wrong. They are incredibly different. These thumb sticks should have been originally on the PS4 controller to begin with. The original sticks were made of very crappy material and the rubber tips wear off so fast. With these sticks, you can absolutely feel the difference. They are very responsive because they are slightly taller which means they actually give you more control. No dead zone by what I can find. I played Destiny heavily for a full day with the new sticks and honestly, they are so much more comfortable. Honestly, I say just buy them. They are not expensive and it's an easy swap procedure. I promise you that you will enjoy them. Its hard to describe the feel of them besides that they grip your thumb and stay in place where you want it. Them being slightly taller means you have more control. For me the biggest selling point was the material they are made of. You can just feel that it is a stronger and better quality material. For a controller costing almost $70, you would think they could put a quality rubber on the thumb stick but they didn't. Bad news for Sony. Just buy these and put them in. You will think like me and go, "Wow! These are the best thing Microsoft ever made for Sony!"
I ordered these assuming they were identical to the Xbox One controller analog sticks, however they are not. Are these still good/reliable?
I've had mine for a few months. Only issue I came across was my own issue. I didn't tighten a screw all the way and I thought my sticks where warped. After I tightened it, the sticks worked good.
Could these fit in a dualshock 2? As in a ps2 controller.
No
When you're done installing the sticks, will the DS4 still work if you don't reconnect the light bar ribbon? Wil lthe controller still work properly?
It will work.
Do they fit in the wii u pro controller?
These are made for the Xbox One controllers and will work with the Sony PS4 controllers. As of any Nintendo product I cannot say because we don't distribute those. I would say its worth a shot if you like to tinker, they only cost a few bucks.
I noticed these are not identical OEM, though they feel quality. Is there any source for actual XBone sticks with the rougher edges to the nubs?
We are selling actual XBone sticks with the rougher edges to the nubs but not sure others. Thanks,
does "2-pack set" mean 2 or 4 analog sticks? How many come in one order?
1 set of 2 sticks. They are awesome--far better than the stock PS4 analogs.
How easy or difficult is it to put these in the Dualshock 4 and how long did it take you to do?
It is fairly easy to do. And it will take you 10-15 minutes to do. I would recommend to look for YouTube videos about how to dismantle a DualShock 4, as there are little parts that require attention and be careful to handle. I hope this helps.
do you need to pay any fees to play online?
Yes it's $15 a month. The game new comes with a 30 day subscription. You can pay online or buy game time cards at the store. You do not need PlayStation plus to play this game online.
What is the size of the packing on this edition?
The box of the actual game is 11 x 8 inches. It came in a box 17 x 16 inches. Depth of about 2 inches for both.
Is Heavenward an expansion to this or is it a completely different game that I'd have to have a subscription for?
It's an expansion.
So I have a square enix account on my Ps3. If I get the ps4 Version can I still use my ps3 account and characters? Or do have to start over?
When you activate the game it will allow you to add ps4 to your existing account.
Will this game work in Irish ps4 or is there a difference
It should as far as I know. PS4 isn't region locked and FFXIV has a European server, so I don't see why it wouldn't.
If someone has already been playing the game as standard on ps3, will they get the collectors' edition bonuses if they upgrade to it on ps4?
Yes, it will be in you mail in the gm
Do you have to pay a subscription fee for the first month if you buy the collector's edition?
There is a trial period
Do you have to be logged into PSN and what about the game patches issued every two months or so? Will you get those?
No, if PSN is down sometimes you can still log in, updates come less often but its fast
If I order this on the PS4, can it be played across platforms online or at least with the PS3 version online; or only with other PS4 owners?
Yes. For instance, I own the game on PS4 but am able to play with one friend who has it on PS3 and another who has it on PC.
I own the standard edition, but a friend of mine is ordering the collector's edition. Is there a way for him to give me the extra content?
No they are bound to you
does this game have co-op?
No, this is a single-player action RPG.
Does the game have dual Audio and Subs? As in English and Japanese.
As for audio, you can purchase the Japanese voice tracks for the whole main game (not the DLC missions), but the subs are English only as far as I know.
Have spanish subtitles?
No, just English and Japanese.
is this game satanic/Demonic? and sexual?
This game is NOT Demonic and it certainly isn't Satanic. As for sexuality, besides the outfit you see the main character in on the cover, and the , very, occasional innuendo from the "old perv" character, there is little sexual in nature about this game. This game is more swords and sorcery. No demons and NO satanic material.
What is required to get Branch A in Drakengard 3?
Branch A is the main branch of the game. You don't need to do anything to unlock it, just play normally. To unlock Branch D, you need to do the Lost Verses and get all the weapons.
For a big fan of Nier, who deeply love the narrative and characters. Would you recommend this game? (Really don't mind the gameplay)
Tentatively. Don't buy it if you're deaf, though. There's reasons. Anyway, if you go into this thinking it will be either Nier or Drakengard 1 you'll be disappointed. But make no mistake that the emotion and writing you'd expect will be there. The humor is juvenile and not always funny, but it fits into the theme of the game: Contrast. For every joke there's a tear, and for every smile there's a funeral. The characters aren't as immediately memorable, but the Zero and her dragon Mikhail have an amazing chemistry that just overshadows everything else anyway. The overall story is a great take on the concepts of "series canon" and timeline effects. You'll first need to know that each ending has a completely separate sequence of events, unlike in Nier where each new ending path led to more context on the situation. Ultimately Draken3 feels like a medieval fantasy timeline story, like a sort of "Steins;Gate" but Drakengard style. The other answerer to your question is rather on point, too. Ultimately it will feel very unique but worth it. Some moments will fall flat while others will be as amazing as you'd hope and each ending is unarguably charged with an explosion of emotions and revelations. Don't go into it expecting Nier, but you can expect quality.
Japanese voice &amp; English subtitles Support?
Only buying the dlc for them .
Is this a disk, or just a code?
it is a disk
Is this a physical package that is actually shipped or just the code that will be received via the downloads tab or email?
you get a traditional dvd plastic case with a code on a slip of paper inside
Do you have to buy the discs to install in order to play online? Or do you just buy the subscription and play?
You don't have to buy the discs, you can download it online. You do have to pay an initial cost, but when you do, it comes with 30 days play time included. Afyerwards you just pay the sub.
Can i try this code if i play on my Mac?
Yes. It is a global code.
why do they ship you a physical time card and not just email you the code?
Beats me, I thought I would get an email with the code or a number, but I had to wait for the physical card. Same thing for WOW.
will this work on the ps4 edition of eso when its released
i wouldn't risk it
Is the included controller wired or wireless?
Wireless. Playstation doesn't make wired controllers for the ps3 or ps4. They are blutooth so they have far better range than other console controllers.
Does this come with an HDMI cable?
no
Is the hobbit game that comes with this bundle the retail case version of the game or does it come in just a cardboard sleeve?
It comes in a cardboard sleeve.
hello, its the fat version or slim version?
It's the super slim, top-loading model.
Does the console include a way to charge the controllers or do you need to buy that seperately?
It has one controller with charge cable.
Does it play Netflix?
Yes
Can this be connected to speakers that were connected computer thru USB ?
You could plug your PS3 to your PC using an optical audio cable, and then you could use the PC speakers with your PS3
Can you play playstation 2 games on it?
nO i'M AFRAID NOT
Can you download movies and save them on the PS3?
Absolutely!
does the bundle have move controller pack
No it would be a regular controller.
Is this mouse accurate for a laser mouse? I know it has a 9800 sensor, but does anyone have any issues with it?
I haven't had a single issue with tracking on any surface I have used it on. As long as the surface is flat it tracks better than any of my razer mice. I would say it tracks far better than my old deathadder. Hope this helps!
What type of Grip? Palm, Fingertip, or Claw?
Palm
Anyone mind enlightening the difference between this and the aLLreli High Precision look alike? The price is a bit more, but the software looks more professional.
Thanks for your inquiry to our product. Yes, they have no difference. The aLLreli mouse is from our factory. And we supply the item and driver for them. Thanks for bringing this matter to our attention. EC Technology Customer Support cs@iectechnology.com
Does this item come with the charger and USB cable?
Yes! And in perfect condition. It does NOT come with a ps vita memory card though.
This is the old model, NOT the slim, correct?
Yes the old model with the OLED screen
This item has any regional restriction? I'm a latinoamerican customer and want to know if it will be fully usable in Mexico. Thanks
no the ps vita does not have any regional restrictions to it. it's like the ps3, so long as you have a psn account you can use it anywhere.
What does it mean when this ps vita has been 'factory Recertified'? Why does it cost less than the others?
There a difference between recertified and refurbished. Refurbed is sold as is usually, whereas recertified still carries a warranty. Both are used and/or fixed models, which is to the reason for the lower price.
dose it come with the charger
Yes it does! And the start up guide and a manual. Everything originally in the box
do the ps vita come with ar cards
No, it does not come with the cards
does it come with the charger cables and everything?
Yes
Which memory card should I get for this if I want to download one or two games, but still have a bunch of save files?
I got the 16G it's perfect for me, I downloaded a few games(4) and still have plenty of space.
Is the OLED screen really worth buying this if you already have the newer, slim version?
No
Can you play games off of the game cards without purchasing a Sony memory card?
Nope, game won't start without a memory card, I tried.

Is this the limited edition or standard edition?
If you pre-order the game, it becomes the Limited Edition. Otherwise, it's a standard edition. That said, I have found 'special editions' of games like this after the launch dates. Overstock from unbought pre-orders and such, but it can also be because of swag that is shipped with every version of a game sold in a particular method.
Does this game work with XP?
It will not work with windows xp because this game requires directx11 which xp does not support.
does it work with vista?
not on mine it didn't. I wish it would have cause I have all od the other Tropico games
Why can't I start the application after installation? Mine is window 8.1
Go to the tropics website and download the hot fix to repair the box install
After download the patch to start the program it start but after I hit the play button it turn off or said it can be run. What I need to do to fix it?
I would contact Kalypso, the game developer
So if I buy the PC Download version will I get the iso an burn my own cd or will I have to be online anytime I play it? Is Steam my only choice?
When u buy the download, you have to replace the .exe with a non steam version. A quick Google search and you should find a forum or something that should point you in the right direction
Just to be clear - this includes a CD and is not a download key game, correct?
Yes
do you need a graphics card to play the game and would my Toshiba satellite c55t-a work?
I use a site like 'can I play this' to check whether a game will run on my computer. I play on a toshiba satellite with integrated graphics card, with no problem
Can tropico 5 play off line?
Yes it can, it is mostly offline but you choose to play onkine
Is it online only
You can buy the CD-ROM from Amazon.
will this work on 2ds?
Yes all 3ds games will work on 2ds. The 2ds is just a 3ds without the 3D feature, that is the only difference.
Is this game appropriate for an 11yr old girl?
Yes it is. As the rating suggests, it says E for everyone :)
Can you play the Tomodachi Life on a regular Nintendo DS?
No, 3/2ds only
How are nicknames used in the game?
Nicknames are used whenever a Mii is referred to. Only when a Mii is hosting a news program or is one of the interview subjects is their full name used or spoken, so use nicknames you don't mind hearing a lot!
If I'm an adult and I play this game, should I be publicly executed or just shunned from all society?
Nah, you'll be alright
Is there a way to have separate save files for each player?
No, I don't believe there is a way to have separate save files for each player. When you save it doesn't let you pick a file.
If I buy used, will I able to create a new game or I am stuck with the previous saved game?
all games are able to restart and be able to create new games. So yes you will be able to make a new game.
is this like sims
sure is
appropriate for 10 yr old girl?
Yes, definitely! There are several little mini games you can play with your Miis that I'm sure a ten year old would have fun with. The Miis do get together and date, get married, and have children. But nothing is ever really shown save for the couple having little hearts floating over their heads when they're around another. And children just appear after the couple asks if it's okay for them to have a baby. I would recommend this for any child :)
I have three children that all love Tomodachi Life demo and are now asking for the full version. Do I have to buy 3 copies of the game for $30?
You can make the kids share a game, but I don't think they'll be very happy with you. Each copy of the game only has one save file on it, meaning only one person can make a seperate game. I'd say you either chip in and buy the three copies of the game, get them used for a lower price, or have the kids fight over which miis get to have certain outfits. Your choice.
will this work on 2ds?

Is $ 19.99 the price for the game itself? Or is the price only to hold a game for me? Either way- please tell me the total game price.Thanks.
The $19.99 is the current price of the PS3 game. If Amazon drops the price before the release date, you will get a refund of the difference between the two prices.
How do I get this to work for two players on players version, game says players 1-4 , network 2-8?
For other players to join your game, they simply need to press start with their own controllers. Also note that split-screen only works on HD TVs where the PS3 is connected to the TV with an HDMI.
What does Minecraft-PS3 - full version mean? Is there a different version?
There is a demo and this version has parental controls.
Is the game fun for adults as well as kids?
If you like building... It's kinda like Lego in a virtual world. You can build buidings & other thing's. Fun for kid's & adults
Do I need to be hooked up to the internet to play this game? I understand the updates but do I NEED to be online to play the game?
No you do not. Only if you want to play multiplayer
Is this the same game that you buy via the playstation network online that downloads direct to your playstation? I don't want o buy the exact same gam
Yes
My PS3 is not online does this game work without an online connection?
You don't need any online connection.
How much violence is in this? I know its rated 10+ but when my kids are playing, it seems there is a lot and I shouldn't be letting them play this.
Please refer to the manufacturer Playstation website for content of this game
Would this game work on a PS3 bought in England? Some games like skylanders will work in any ps3 console others will have a specific region like dvds
This is how somebody summed it up in a forum I found on this subject. "Technically a PS3 game from any region can work on a PS3 console from any region. However multiplayer might be more complicated, some games may force you to play with others from the same region as the game. Other games will be fine. Also I believe DLC is not region free, so you'll have to make sure any DLC is bought for the game's region." On the last part, I'm assuming that would mean that you'd need to buy any DLC from the US playstation store instead of the UK store. Also important to note with this specific game; If you intend to do lots of online play, you may wanna do more research on this particular game. I play on a US PS3 with a US copy, and I play with my gf who is in New Zealand, so I would assume the online should be fine for playing with others of any region. Hope I didn't ramble too much. And I hope it helps. Good luck with your purchases!
Can this game be played on the PS2?

Can this game be played on the PS2?
Hi there, This game cannot be played on the Play Station 2.
Will this game spoil anything for someone who has only watched up to episode 170?
This game continues from where the anime is at, and it appears to be showcasing what will happen in the future. I highly recommend you watch up to episode 650, and you'll be safe! Enjoy the show and journey, cause this game will offer a lot of it. ^_^

That's the beauty of this game. This game is intended for new and old One Piece fans! You won't feel lost at all. You'll learn along the way, which character is which. =D
Will the game have english subtitles?
Yes, it has subtitles. Here is the beginning (51 minutes) of the English version of the game if you want to see what it will look like: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0dM3LShhdo

You need two copies bro

It's English
Is this a hard copy or a download?
Hard copy
is this much different than the wii u version?
I would love to give you answer but I've only played the 3DS version.... But I'm sure the only difference would be even better graphics on the wii U and controls would be slightly different... You can maybe look up videos on YouTube to get a better answer though... Sorry I couldn't answer your question
Is Trafalgar Law in this game? Is he playable, npc???
Yes he is, and he's playable.

the standard edition won't give you the free costume dlc, and extra side-quest.

You don't need a steam account to buy it but you do need an account to play it.

I used a wired 360 controller but not all the buttons were mapped I think it was the hitch button but that may be fixed now
Will this download work on the iMac?
There's ways around it tht I haven't done. There is a system called bootcamp
will Spin Tires will work with 2.80 Ghz dual core with a intergrated Intel GMA X4500 graphics
To be honest idk srry
if spin tires will work on windows 7/8/and vista will it work on windows 8.1
I have been seeing a lot of PC Games having this issue playing on Windows 8.1 because they have been configured to play on windows 7,and 8. 8.1 was a free add on for people to customize windows 8 to look and feel like windows 7. You can go to WWW.Microsoft.com/windows8 to uninstall the 8.1 add on so you can have windows 8.0 again. I recommend this until we see games compatable for windows 8.1
Would it work on a lap top
Yes wat kind of laptop windows or Mac
will it work with g27 wheel?
I'm not shore it should work as it works with my Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick. You can try and see if it works you can let me know.
can u mod this one
Yes you can. I personally download from spintires.nl, but I'm sure there's other websites. Although I should note is that if put mods into the game, you'll not be able to play multiplayer until you take the mods out of the game. BACK UP YOUR FILES!!! I can't stress that enough. It's a little different adding mods than from the demo version.

You don't need a steam account to buy it but you do need an account to play it.

Can you use your device while this is plugged, for example on a plane trip my Kindle HD is almost dead, I plugged this in and I'm all good?
Yes - you can use your device while this is plugged in. However, depending on your device and usage, this 5600 mAh unit may or may not charge it as fast as you are draining the battery. (Reading a book is probably fine, but playing games or watching video may only extend the time before you run out of juice.) You can get around that by simply recharging your device (Kindle HD) before it is almost dead.
